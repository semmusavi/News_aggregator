middleeast,Aysenur Eygi: Israel says ‘highly likely’ its forces shot slain American activist,2024-09-10,Dana Karni,"US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has called for “fundamental changes” to the way Israeli forces operate in the occupied West Bank after the killing of American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi at a protest last week.

Blinken’s sharply worded rebuke came after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire.”

In its initial inquiry into the incident, the IDF said that the shot was not aimed at the activist, but at “the key instigator” of a “violent riot” at the Beita Junction where it said Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at Israeli security forces. It didn’t name the alleged instigator.

The International Solidarity Movement (ISM), with whom Eygi had been volunteering, said that its protest on September 6 was peaceful.

At a news conference in London on Tuesday, Blinken said Eygi’s killing was “unprovoked and unjustified” and demanded changes to the rules of engagement of Israel forces operating in the West Bank.

“No one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest. No one should have to put their life at risk just for expressing their views,” he said. “Now we have the second American citizen killed at the hands of Israeli security forces. It’s not acceptable. It has to change. And we’ll be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government.”

Blinken added that the United States had “long seen” reports of Israeli forces ignoring extremist settler violence against Palestinians and reports of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians.

Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into the occupied West Bank in recent months.

In recent months, the US has unveiled a series of sanctions targeting Israel settler violence against Palestinians.

The IDF began a major raid in multiple parts of the territory last month, bulldozing highways and razing buildings in the process. OIn Tuesday, at least two Palestinians – a man and a woman – were killed during an Israeli military incursion in the city of Tulkarem, according to the Ministry of Health in Ramallah.

Israeli troops and settlers have killed 692 Palestinians, including 158 children, in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Family says Israel’s inquiry is ‘wholly inadequate’

The family of the 26-year-old activist said they were “deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional,” reiterating calls to US leaders for an independent investigation into her death.

Eygi, who was born in Turkey, was shot while taking part in a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law.

She was a recent graduate of the University of Washington, and had been volunteering with the same pro-Palestinian activist group as Rachel Corrie, a US citizen killed in 2003 while attempting to stop an Israeli bulldozer from demolishing Palestinian homes in Gaza.

Eygi’s family, who have previously blamed Israel for her killing, said the findings of the Israeli inquiry were “wholly inadequate.” “This cannot be misconstrued as anything except a deliberate, targeted and precise attack by the military against an unarmed civilian,” the family said.

The ISM also dismissed Israel’s “specious claim” that Eygi was unintentionally hit by IDF fire, describing the slain activist as “one of the hundreds of thousands of martyrs Israel has killed over decades of ethnic cleansing, displacement, and genocide.”

“The military’s account of the events is blindly based on the accomplices’ version, which completely contradicts the testimonies of multiple eye witnesses, who the military did not even contact,” the group said in a statement on Tuesday.

“All eyewitnesses said immediately following the killing that the scene where Aysenur was killed was completely quiet, and that there could have been no excuse to open fire, let alone directly hitting a woman peacefully standing in an olive grove.”"

middleeast,"Al-Mawasi, Gaza: Dozens killed in Israeli airstrike on humanitarian zone targeting Hamas militants",2024-09-09,"Mohammed Tawfeeq, Irene Nasser","An overnight Israeli airstrike on an area that Israel itself had designated as a humanitarian zone for displaced people in southern Gaza killed and injured dozens of Palestinians, according to local officials in the besieged enclave. Israel said the operation targeted Hamas fighters there.

At least 19 bodies arrived at hospitals from the humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi. Earlier, Gaza’s Civil Defense said 40 people had been killed, though the reason for the discrepancy in the two figures was not immediately clear.

More than 60 people were also wounded in the strike, according to the Gaza Civil Defense, as rescuers raced to recover victims buried under sand and debris.

Eyewitnesses said at least five missiles struck the area, according to the group. The explosion created three large craters, Gaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said.

The group said its crews were facing “great difficulty” in retrieving victims – many of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the time of the strikes – due to a lack of resources.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Monday evening it “struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command-and-control center embedded inside the humanitarian area” in Khan Younis, Gaza.

Among those targeted were Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, whom the IDF says was the head of Hamas’ aerial unit in Gaza, Osama Tabesh, whom was “the head of the observation and targets department in Hamas’ military intelligence headquarters,” and Ayman Mabhouh, whom it said was “another senior Hamas terrorist.”

The targets were “directly involved in the execution” of the October 7 attack on Israel and had been planning to “carry out terror activities” against the IDF and Israel, the IDF statement on Tuesday added.

The IDF provided no more information about the alleged militants. CNN is working to independently verify the claims.

Hamas denied it had placed fighters in the area. In a statement, it called Israel’s claims that its fighters were in the area “a blatant lie, through which it (Israel) seeks to justify these heinous crimes.”

The strike hit Al-Mawasi, a coastal region in Khan Younis where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled Israel’s bombardment from other parts of Gaza. Many are living in tents in an area with sparse infrastructure, scant access to shelter or life-saving humanitarian aid.

Human rights agencies have repeatedly criticized Israeli attacks in designated safe zones. On Tuesday, the Norwegian Refugee Council accused Israeli forces of “forcing Palestinians in Gaza to flee from place to place without offering them genuine assurances of safety, proper accommodation or return once hostilities end.”

The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel has flattened neighborhoods, wiped out families and created a humanitarian disaster across the enclave. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 41,020 Palestinians and injured another 94,925 people, according to the Ministry of Health there.

CNN footage from the aftermath of the strike on Al-Mawasi showed dozens of people trying to recover the remains of their belongings. Poles that used to hold up tents protruded from the sand, but the material that covered their inhabitants was buried. Mattresses, blankets and clothes were scattered around another much bigger crater on the other side of the camp.

Some survivors pulled canned food from under the sand and a girl with an injured hand watched as those around her attempt to rebuild their tents.

“We were sleeping peacefully in our homes when, suddenly, rockets started falling heavily on us,” one survivor, Salem Abu Jara, told CNN. “Why are people being burned here?”

Families ‘disappeared in the sand’

Israel’s military said the operation was carried out with the direction of the Israel Security Agency and the Air Force, and that steps were taken to mitigate civilian harm “including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional means.” The military did not say whether it warned civilians in the area.

Hamas said “dozens of unarmed civilians, most of whom were children and women” were killed in the strike.

Gaza Civil Defense’s Bassal said Palestinians in the area were not warned of the strike in advance. There were more than 200 tents of displaced people at Al-Mawasi area, Bassal said, adding about 20 to 40 tents were destroyed and “entire families have disappeared in the sand.”

Two weapons experts told CNN the visual evidence from the scene of the assault in Al-Mawasi suggests 2,000-pound bombs were used.

“The significant damage and the size of the craters align with the expected effects of aerial bombs weighing several hundred kilograms,” Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), said on Tuesday.

CNN footage from the aftermath showed emergency crews wearing bright orange vests and scouring dense, blown-out debris for survivors. Rescue personnel could be seen hauling large pieces of barbed wire and dusty mattresses in the dark.

The IDF has accused Hamas and other militant groups in the Gaza Strip of continuing to “systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure, including the designated Humanitarian Area, to carry out terrorist activity against the State of Israel and IDF troops.”

Israel has previously struck Al-Mawasi in its pursuit for Hamas commanders and previous strikes have caused significant civilian collateral casualties.

In mid-July, a strike aimed at Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif killed at least 90 Palestinians.

The following month, Israel said its intelligence community had confirmed that Deif, one of the reported masterminds of the October 7 attacks, was killed in that attack.

Israel says it has killed or captured half of Hamas’s commanders and more than 14,000 combatants since the war began. However, there are clear signs of the group’s resurgence in parts of the strip previously cleared by Israeli forces, who devastated large swathes of the area in the process.

Surrounded by fire ‘from every side’

CNN footage from Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on Tuesday showed men and boys standing in congregation to perform Islamic funeral prayers for the deceased. Mourners carried the dead, including children, in white shrouds as women wailed at the steps of the hospital.

“People thought they were asleep safely. Suddenly we woke up to the sounds of explosions, and fires were surrounding us from every side. We didn’t know where the strike hit, where the remains are, or where the blood is. Everything was scattered,” Mahmoud Al Nims, a resident, told CNN.

The Israeli military has placed nearly 86% of the Gaza Strip under evacuation orders, according to the UN. At least 1.9 million people have been displaced

Another Palestinian, Taghreed Abu Assi, said: “They (Israel) told us to go to Mawasi and we did, and they strike us. We have been displaced a hundred times.”"
africa,"Rebecca Cheptegei: Alleged killer of Ugandan Olympian dies from burns, hospital says",2024-09-10,Story Reuters,"Reuters —

The man accused of dousing in petrol and setting alight Olympic runner Rebecca Cheptegei has died from burns sustained during the fatal attack on the Ugandan athlete, a hospital official said on Tuesday.

Cheptegei, 33, who competed in the marathon at the Paris Olympics, suffered burns to more than 75% of her body in the Sept. 1 attack and died four days later.

Her former boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, died at 6.30 p.m. (11.30 a.m. ET) on Monday, said Philip Kirwa, chief executive officer of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret in western Kenya where Marangach was being treated and where Cheptegei also died.

“He developed respiratory failure as a result of the severe airway burns and sepsis that led to his eventual death,” Kirwa said in a statement.

Kirwa said Marangach had suffered over 41% burns following his assault on Cheptegei, which local media reported to have happened after she returned home from church with her children.

Cheptegei, who finished 44th in Paris, is the third elite sportswoman to be killed in Kenya since October 2021. Her death has put the spotlight on domestic violence in the East African country, particularly within its running community.

“This guy is dead because he killed my daughter. He has died because of his actions,” Cheptegei’s father, Joseph Cheptegei, told Reuters.

Rights groups say female athletes in Kenya, where many international runners train in the high-altitude highlands, are at a high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their prize money, which far exceeds local incomes.

“Justice really would have been for him to sit in jail and think about what he had done. This is not positive news whatsoever,” said Viola Cheptoo, co-founder of Tirop’s Angels, a support group for survivors of domestic violence in Kenya’s athletic community.

“The shock of Rebecca’s death is still fresh,” Cheptoo told Reuters.

Cheptoo co-founded Tirop’s Angels in memory of Agnes Tirop, a rising star in Kenya’s highly competitive athletics scene, who was found dead in her home in the town of Iten in October 2021, with multiple stab wounds to the neck.

Ibrahim Rotich, Tirop’s husband, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty. The case is ongoing.

Nearly 34% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15-49 years have suffered physical violence, according to government data from 2022, with married women at particular risk. The 2022 survey found that 41% of married women had faced violence.

Globally, a woman is killed by someone in her own family every 11 minutes, according to a 2023 UN Women study.

“I don’t wish bad things on anyone, but of course I would have loved for him to face the law as an example for others so that these attacks on women can stop,” Beatrice Ayikoru, secretary-general of the Uganda Olympic Committee, told Reuters."
europe,Moscow: Ukraine strikes Russian capital in biggest drone attack to date,2024-09-10,Story Reuters,"Reuters —

Ukraine struck the Moscow region on Tuesday in its biggest drone attack so far on the Russian capital, killing at least one woman, wrecking dozens of homes and forcing around 50 flights to be diverted from airports around Moscow.

Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power, said it destroyed at least 20 Ukrainian attack drones as they swarmed over the Moscow region, which has a population of more than 21 million, and 124 more over eight other regions.

At least one person was killed near Moscow, Russian authorities said. Three of Moscow’s four airports were closed for more than six hours and almost 50 flights were diverted.

Kyiv said Russia, which sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, had attacked it overnight with 46 drones, of which 38 were destroyed.

The drone attacks on Russia damaged at high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, setting flats on fire, residents told Reuters.

A 46-year-old woman was killed and three people were wounded in Ramenskoye, Moscow regional governor Andrei Vorobyov said.

Residents said they awoke to blasts and fire.

“I looked at the window and saw a ball of fire,” Alexander Li, a resident of the district told Reuters. “The window got blown out by the shockwave.”

Georgy, a resident who declined to give his surname, said he heard a drone buzzing outside his building in the early hours.

“I drew back the curtain and it hit the building right before my eyes, I saw it all,” he said. “I took my family and we ran outside.”

The Ramenskoye district, some 50 km (31 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, has a population of around quarter a million of people, according to official data.

More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia’s Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia’s defense ministry said. There was no damage or casualties reported there.

Drone war

As Russia advances in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv has taken the war to Russia with a cross-border attack in Russia’s western Kursk region that began on Aug. 6 and by carrying out increasingly large drone attacks deep into Russian territory.

The war has largely been a grinding artillery and drone war along the 1,000 km (620 mile) heavily fortified front line in southern and eastern Ukraine involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.

Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production and assembly to attack targets including tanks, energy infrastructure such as refineries and airfields.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigors of the war, says the Ukrainian drone attacks are “terrorism” as they target civilian infrastructure - and has vowed a response.

Moscow and other big Russian cities have largely been insulated from the war.

Russia has hit Ukraine with thousands of missiles and drones in the last two-and-a-half years, killing thousands of civilians, wrecking much of the country’s energy system and damaging commercial and residential properties across the country.

Ukraine says it has a right to strike back deep into Russia, though Kyiv’s Western backers have said they do not want a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine about Tuesday’s attacks. Both sides deny targeting civilians.

Tuesday’s attack follow drone attacks Ukraine launched in early September targeting chiefly Russia’s energy and power facilities.

Authorities of the Tula region, which neighbors the Moscow region to its north, said drone wreckage fell onto a fuel and energy facility but the “technological process” of the facility was not affected."
asia,Pope Francis’ Mass in one of world’s most Catholic nations gathers almost half its population,2024-09-09,"Christopher Lamb, Helen Regan, Kathleen Magramo","Dili, East Timor CNN —

Pope Francis received a rapturous welcome from the tiny Southeast Asian nation of East Timor, one of the world’s most Catholic countries, where almost half the population turned out for an open-air Mass on Tuesday.

The 87-year-old leader’s visit marks the penultimate stop of a marathon trip through Asia and the South Pacific. Local authorities estimate that a crowd of 600,000 gathered for the pope’s Mass, the Vatican told reporters.

By early Tuesday morning, streets in the capital Dili were packed with cheering crowds, from elderly worshippers to babies in strollers, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pope.

Photos showed a sea of people carrying yellow and white umbrellas, the colors of the Vatican, as they tried to shield themselves from the sun, and at one point a man was seen hosing down the crowd with water to cool them down.

Some attendees had been waiting in the seaside park where the mass took place since 4 a.m. - more than 12 hours before the event began.

Estefania Clotaria-Monterio Gutierrez Ornai, 25, was among them, keen to secure a place in the front row.

“I hope that through his visit here, he can show us to be more respectful to each other and encourage us that, one day, one of us could become the pope like him!” she told CNN.

On arriving at the park to shouts of “Viva Papa Francesco,” people with physical disabilities lined up to meet the pontiff, and a group performed a traditional, cultural dance for him. During the Mass prayers were also said in local dialects.

At the conclusion of the Mass, the pope addressed the crowd in Spanish with a priest translating into Timorese.

Francis drew laughs and cheers when he referenced crocodiles: there are large numbers of crocodiles in the sea around East Timor, and traditional belief holds that reptiles represent people’s ancestors.

“Be careful,” the pope told them. “I was told that crocodiles are coming to some beaches. Crocodiles that come swimming and have a stronger bite than we can handle. Be attentive to those crocodiles that want to change your culture, your history. And stay away from those crocodiles because they bite, and they bite a lot.”

During his homily, he also praised East Timor for the large number of children in the country, which he said was a “great gift.”

It is not the first time Francis has addressed birthrates in this trip: in Indonesia he praised the country for having large families and contrasted that with low birthrates in other parts of the world.

After the Mass concluded, the Timorese singer, Maria Vitória da Costa Borges – known as “Marvi” – performed on stage. A onetime winner of Portugal’s “The Voice,” she performed alongside another Timorese singer, known as Bepi.

Francis addresses sexual abuse

But the issue of clerical sexual abuse is also hanging over this leg of the pope’s visit to the region as revelations of mistreatment concerning high profile East Timor clergy have emerged in recent years.

During his speech to the country’s political authorities, the pope called on them to tackle “every kind of abuse” to “guarantee a healthy and peaceful childhood for all young people.”

East Timor, also known as Timor Leste, is one of the world’s youngest countries and has deep ties to the Catholic Church, which was influential in its tumultuous and bloody fight for independence from Indonesia.

The country of just 1.3 million people is the second-most Catholic country in the world, with 97% of the population identifying as Catholic, the highest share outside of the Vatican.

The government of East Timor allocated $12 million for Francis’ first visit to the deeply devout country, an amount which has been criticized as an exorbitant burden given it remains a small economy and one of Asia’s poorest nations.

The pontiff’s visit also puts fresh scrutiny on the scourge of sexual abuse in the church and on whether Francis will directly address the issue while he’s in East Timor, as he has done in other countries.

Two years ago, the Vatican acknowledged that it had secretly disciplined East Timor bishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Carlos Ximenes Belo, after he was accused of sexually abusing boys decades before.

In past trips abroad, Francis has met with victims of abuse. Though not on the official program of his visit, some analysts have said if Pope Francis addresses the abuse while in East Timor, it would send a strong message to survivors and those who have not come forward, whether in the country or around the region.

A regional bastion of Catholicism

Pope Francis’ 12-day visit to Asia includes Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore – underscoring a significant shift inside the Catholic Church as it pivots to Asia.

He is the second pope to visit East Timor, after Pope John Paul II in 1989, but it’s the first papal visit for the country since it gained independence in 2002. The visit comes less than a week after the country marked the 25th anniversary of its vote to secede from Indonesia.

Located between northwestern Australia and Indonesia, the country occupies half of the island of Timor and was used by the Portuguese since the 17th century as a trading post for sandalwood.

Four hundred years of ensuing Portuguese colonial rule led to the widespread spread of Catholicism in East Timor and other cultural differences from Muslim-majority Indonesia.

Today, East Timor’s economy is heavily reliant on its oil and gas reserves, and still contends with high levels of poverty following decades of conflict.

Christina Kheng, a theologian who teaches at the East Asian Pastoral Institute, told CNN that the young nation “is still struggling with post-war unity and nation building.”

Like other countries in the region, East Timor is in the middle of the United States and China’s push for influence in Asia, with US ally Australia at the forefront in providing assistance.

Bishop Belo and sex abuse allegations

A leading pro-democracy figure during the Indonesian occupation was Bishop Belo, the former head of the Catholic Church in East Timor, who won the Nobel Peace Prize alongside President Jose Ramos-Horta in 1996 for their work in bringing a peaceful end to the conflict.

In 2022, the Vatican confirmed that it had sanctioned Belo two years prior, following allegations from two men who said the bishop raped them when they were teenagers and gave them money to buy their silence.

The Vatican said that Belo, who is understood to be based in Portugal, had been placed under travel restrictions, “prohibition of voluntary contact with minors, of interviews and contacts with Timor Leste.”

While the allegations against Belo date back to the 1980, the Vatican said it first became involved in the case in 2019.

CNN has asked the Vatican if the case of Bishop Belo will be addressed during the pope’s trip.

Dutch newspaper De Groene Amsterdammer broke the news and said its investigation found that other boys were also allegedly victims of Belo’s abuse dating back to the 1980s.

Belo has never been officially charged in East Timor and has never spoken publicly about the accusations.

Many abuse victims in East Timor have been reluctant to come forward due to the church’s deep connection to the independence struggle, and because of the government’s treatment of the few who have been convicted.

Since Pope Francis became the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics in 2013, multiple reports detailing decades of sexual abuse, systemic failures and cover-ups across multiple countries have been released.

While he was criticized for some of his actions – such as when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up a sex scandal in 2018, a decision he later described as a “grave error” – he has since taken a firm stance on the issues and introduced some reforms, including provisions for holding lay leaders of Vatican-approved associations accountable for cover-ups of sexual abuse.

The church and East Timor’s independence struggle

Amid civil war, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia in 1976 and declared the country’s 27th province following Portugal’s democratization and its decision to shed its colonies the year before.

Between 1975 and 1999, more than 200,000 people – about a quarter of the population – were killed in fighting and massacres or died as a result of famine as Indonesia’s occupying forces tried to brutally assert control.

Indonesia was condemned by the international community for its crackdown, including in 1991 when its troops massacred young independence supporters at the Santa Cruz cemetery in East Timor’s capital Dili. The capture and jailing of Timorese guerilla leader and now Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao the following year further fanned a resurgence in opposition to Indonesian rule.

It was Indonesian President Suharto’s fall from power in 1998 and an ensuing shift in policy toward East Timor that paved the way for a UN-sponsored referendum on East Timor’s independence – which passed with more than 78.5% support in 1999.

Soon after the vote, pro-Jakarta militias backed by the Indonesian military went on a killing and looting rampage in the capital, attacking churches, and targeting priests and those seeking refuge as they hunted down independence supporters.

Much of East Timor’s infrastructure was destroyed in the violence and about 200,000 people were forced to flee their homes. An Australian-led international peacekeeping mission ultimately intervened and East Timor officially won independence in 2002.

During Indonesian occupation, the Catholic Church played a huge role in defending people from attacks and pushing for a vote on independence – its church workers and the clergy paying a bloody price as a result."
middleeast,Three Israeli civilians shot dead at Allenby Crossing between West Bank and Jordan,2024-09-08,Tamar Michaelis,"Three Israeli civilians have been killed in a shooting at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, Israeli authorities said Sunday.

The Israel Airports Authority, which runs the border terminal at the Allenby Crossing with Jordan, told CNN that the three men who died worked at the crossing.

“The terrorist shot dead three employees of the Allenby terminal at close range,” before being killed by a security guard, the manager of the crossing, Alex Chen, said.

The Allenby crossing mainly serves Palestinians and foreigners. Israelis are not allowed to use it.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “a terrorist approached the area of the Allenby Bridge from Jordan in a truck, exited the truck, and opened fire at the Israeli security forces operating at the bridge.”

“Three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack,” the IDF said, adding that the assailant had been shot dead. The IDF also published a photograph of the hand gun it said was used in the attack.

Israeli police spoke of “several casualties at the scene,” and also said the shooter had “been neutralized.”

Jordanian authorities said a preliminary investigation had identified the suspect as Maher Diab Hussein Al-Jazi, a Jordanian citizen from Al-Hussainiya in the Maan governorate south of the capital, Amman.

Al-Jazi had acted alone, the Jordanian Ministry of Interior said, adding that he had driven over the crossing in a vehicle taking commercial goods from Jordan to the West Bank. It said various authorities were now coordinating the repatriation of Al-Jazi’s body for burial in Jordan.

The suspected gunman’s brother Shady Al-Jazi said his family had been surprised by the news, which they learned through satellite television. He suggested his brother’s anger at Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza may have been a motivating factor.

“He used to work as a truck driver and would cross (the bridge) often to offload the truck and then return back to Jordan. But his grief over what’s happening to the Muslim nation, seeing all the killing in Gaza, and every one of us who feels passionately for his brethren, this could motivate him,” he told Jordanian news outlet Ammon in an on-air interview.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the shooting, saying the three Israelis were murdered by a “despicable terrorist.”

In remarks at the beginning of the weekly government meeting, Netanyahu said Israel was “surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran’s axis of evil.”

The Jordanian government also condemned the shooter’s actions, with the foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah saying the country rejects and condemns “violence and targeting civilians for any reason.”

However, the ministry also hinted there was a link between extremism and Israel’s actions in Gaza and the West Bank, calling for moves “to address the root causes and de-escalate tensions” and noting Jordan’s efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza.

The incident comes almost two weeks after Israel’s military launched one of its most expansive operations in the West Bank in years, carrying out raids, bulldozing highways, and launching airstrikes in multiple parts of the occupied territory.

Clashes in the West Bank have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7.

Israeli troops and settlers have killed nearly 700 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians.

All three land crossings between Israel and Jordan were closed following the attack, the Israel Airports Authority said. On Monday, the Yitzhak Rabin crossing connecting Jordan to Eilat and the Jordan River crossing connecting Jordan to the occupied West Bank reopened to passenger traffic, according to the AIA, which said both would open to cargo traffic from Tuesday. The Allenby Crossing remained closed Monday but is expected to open to passengers only from Tuesday.

All Jordanian drivers who were questioned following the incident have since been released, and over 100 trucks have returned to Jordan, Jordanian authorities said.

Jordan became the second Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel in 1994. It has been highly critical of Israel’s military operations in the West Bank and Gaza.

middleeast,Three Israeli civilians shot dead at Allenby Crossing between West Bank and Jordan,2024-09-08,Tamar Michaelis,"Three Israeli civilians have been killed in a shooting at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, Israeli authorities said Sunday.

The Israel Airports Authority, which runs the border terminal at the Allenby Crossing with Jordan, told CNN that the three men who died worked at the crossing.

“The terrorist shot dead three employees of the Allenby terminal at close range,” before being killed by a security guard, the manager of the crossing, Alex Chen, said.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “a terrorist approached the area of the Allenby Bridge from Jordan in a truck, exited the truck, and opened fire at the Israeli security forces operating at the bridge.”

“Three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack,” the IDF said, adding that the assailant had been shot dead. The IDF also published a photograph of the hand gun it said was used in the attack.

Israeli police spoke of “several casualties at the scene,” and also said the shooter had “been neutralized.”

Jordanian authorities said a preliminary investigation had identified the suspect as Maher Diab Hussein Al-Jazi, a Jordanian citizen from Al-Hussainiya in the Maan governorate south of the capital, Amman.

Al-Jazi had acted alone, the Jordanian Ministry of Interior said, adding that he had driven over the crossing in a vehicle taking commercial goods from Jordan to the West Bank. It said various authorities were now coordinating the repatriation of Al-Jazi’s body for burial in Jordan.

The suspected gunman’s brother Shady Al-Jazi said his family had been surprised by the news, which they learned through satellite television. He suggested his brother’s anger at Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza may have been a motivating factor.

“He used to work as a truck driver and would cross (the bridge) often to offload the truck and then return back to Jordan. But his grief over what’s happening to the Muslim nation, seeing all the killing in Gaza, and every one of us who feels passionately for his brethren, this could motivate him,” he told Jordanian news outlet Ammon in an on-air interview.

africa,Sudan conflict: At least 21 killed in airstrike on Sudanese market as civil war rages,2024-09-09,Nimi Princewill,"An airstrike targeting civilian areas in southeastern Sudan has left more than 20 people dead and dozens of others wounded, authorities in the embattled Sennar state said, as civil war rages between the country’s army and a paramilitary militia.

At least 21 civilians were killed and 63 injured in the air raid on Sunday, Sennar’s acting governor Tawfiq Muhammad Ali said Monday, according to state-run news agency SUNA.

The aerial bombing, blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), was also confirmed by activist group Emergency Lawyers, which keeps track of human rights abuses and civilian casualties. The lawyers’ group said more than 30 people were killed in the RSF attack, which it said targeted a market and other civilian locations.

The RSF, which assumed near-total control of the city after capturing it in July, has yet to comment on the claims.

The activist group also attributed a similar airstrike in the nearby al-Souki town that killed four people to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).

CNN has made attempts to reach the Sudanese army and the RSF for comment. Both the SAF and the RSF have frequently accused each other of killing civilians as war between them enters a second year.

The conflict has left at least 18,000 people dead and displaced more than 10 million others since April 2023. The fighting has also triggered “one of the worst humanitarian disasters” according to the United Nations, with over half of the country’s population facing acute hunger.

On Friday, a UN inquiry into the Sudanese conflict found that both warring factions have committed “an appalling range” of human rights abuses that “may amount to war crimes.”

Some of those violations by the SAF and RSF included “indiscriminate and direct attacks carried out through airstrikes and shelling against civilians, schools, hospitals, communication networks and vital water and electricity supplies,” according to the UN report.

The report called for the deployment of an independent force to protect civilians as well as a nationwide arms embargo.

Those recommendations were rejected by the Sudanese foreign ministry which denounced the UN report."
uk,"Catherine, Princess of Wales, ‘doing what I can to stay cancer free’ after finishing chemotherapy",2024-09-09,"Max Foster, Christian Edwards","London CNN —

Catherine, Princess of Wales, has said she has completed her chemotherapy and is “doing what I can to stay cancer free,” as she plans to return gradually to public life in the coming months.

Catherine, who revealed in March she has been diagnosed with cancer, said in a highly personal video released Monday that she is entering a “new phase of recovery with a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life.”

The princess, known as Kate, has made just two public appearances since her diagnosis, which came after she underwent major abdominal surgery shortly after Christmas.

“As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy treatment,” said Kate, 42, who is married to the heir to the British throne, Prince William.

“Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus,” she continued. “Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.”

In a video message showing scenes from the English summer, Kate, William and their three children – Prince Louis, Princess Charlotte and Prince George – are seen walking through forests, picnicking, playing among sand dunes and wading in the sea.

“The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family,” she says in the video, filmed last month in Norfolk, on England’s eastern coast. “The cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you.”

“This time has above all reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life, which so many of us often take for granted. Of simply loving and being loved,” Kate says in the video message.

She said she is looking forward to returning to work and will be “undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months when I can,” keeping a light schedule to allow her to recover fully. She is expected to attend the annual Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in London in November, honoring those who have served in war.

Dr. William Dahut, Chief Scientific Officer of the American Cancer Society, said the first six to 24 months after chemotherapy were usually the “most critical period” for cancer patients “because if signs of the cancer cells were to come shortly after chemotherapy it would imply there was resistance to that form of chemo.”

He also noted that chemotherapy had side effects that depended on the age of the patient and the type of treatment.

“Monitoring long-term side effects, like cardiac issues and neuropathy will certainly be important for her overall health,” he said, adding, “I think the message is, in order to fully recover, she’ll need attention to every aspect of her wellness beyond her cancer.”

Kensington Palace initially said Kate’s surgery had been for a non-cancerous abdominal condition but, following frenzied speculation about her wellbeing and prolonged absence from public life, Kate revealed her diagnosis in a video message in March.

Her diagnosis stunned the country, coming just weeks after King Charles III announced in February that he had also been diagnosed with cancer. Neither royal has specified the type of cancer for which they are receiving treatment.

In her initial announcement, Kate stressed she had been advised to undergo a course of “preventative” chemotherapy. Preventative chemotherapy is often used after surgery as an “adjuvant” therapy, to weaken the chances of cancer returning, Dr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, previously told CNN.

In June, Kate said she was making “good progress” in her recovery and that she expected her treatment to continue “for a few more months.”

The next day – making her first public appearance since Christmas Day – Kate joined Charles and family members on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the Trooping the Colour ceremony in June, marking the monarch’s official birthday.

Before her appearance at the ceremony, Kate said she was making “good progress” in her recovery and that she expected her treatment to continue “for a few more months.”

In July, she received a standing ovation from the Centre Court crowd as she attended the Wimbledon men’s singles final with her daughter Princess Charlotte.

Charles and Queen Camilla welcomed Kate’s announcement as “wonderful news” and will “continue to offer all love, thoughts and support to the princess on her continued path to full recovery,” a royal source told CNN.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his predecessor Rishi Sunak also welcomed the news.

“On behalf of the entire country, I send her my very best wishes for a full recovery,” Starmer said in a post on X.

Sunak, also in a post on X, said it was “wonderful news.”

“(Her Royal Highness) The Princess of Wales has been so brave in sharing her battle with cancer and we all look forward to seeing her resume royal duties soon,” Sunak said."
americas,Gonzalez: Venezuelan opposition leader lands in Spain seeking asylum after disputed election,2024-09-08,"Mauricio Torres, Stefano Pozzebon, Alex Stambaugh, Manuel Cobela, Pau Mosquera","Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez landed in Madrid on Sunday afternoon, Spain said, after fleeing his home country with an arrest warrant accusing him of terrorism, conspiracy and other crimes related to July’s disputed presidential election.

Gonzalez, his wife and Spanish officials landed at the Torrejon de Ardoz military air base, according to a statement from Spain’s Foreign Ministry. He is now seeking asylum in Spain, CNN understands.

Gonzalez said Sunday his departure from the country came despite “coercion and threats” that he would not be allowed to leave – though he did not make explicit who had made those threats. In an audio note shared with CNN en Español by his press team, Gonzalez said he trusts that “very soon, we will continue the fight for freedom and democracy in Venezuela,” and thanked his followers for their messages of solidarity.

He said later that he had decided to leave “thinking of Venezuela and that our destiny as a country cannot, should not be, one of a conflict of pain and suffering.”

He also thanked the Spanish government for granting him protection and called for continued political dialogue within Venezuela.

Venezuela’s Attorney General Tarek William Saab told CNN on Sunday that authorities will close the case against Gonzalez after his departure.

“We, along with Edmundo Gonzalez’s lawyer in the upcoming days will establish the form, time and place to judicially close that case,” he said.

Venezuela has been in a state of crisis since the poll, in which authoritarian incumbent Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner by the country’s electoral authority – a body stacked with his allies – with 51% of the vote.

But tens of thousands of tallies published by the opposition showed a convincing win for Gonzalez. Venezuela’s opposition and multiple Latin American leaders refused to recognize Maduro’s victory, which sparked deadly protests during which thousands were arrested.

In a statement on Sunday, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Gonzalez’s departure was “the direct result of the anti-democratic measures.”

“The election results and the will of the people cannot be merely swept aside by Maduro and the Venezuelan electoral authorities. We stand with González Urrutia in his call to continue the struggle for liberty and the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,” Blinken said.

A day earlier, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in a statement that Gonzalez “has left the country and requested political asylum” from Spain.

She added that Gonzalez had been staying at Spain’s embassy in the capital Caracas, as a “voluntary refugee,” and that Venezuela allowed him to leave “for the sake of the tranquility and political peace of the country.”

Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Gonzalez was “at his own request” flying to Spain on a Spanish Air Force plane. “The government of Spain is committed to the political rights and physical integrity of all Venezuelans,” he wrote on X.

The minister’s office would not give further details on how long Gonzalez had been in the Spanish embassy.

However, the foreign ministry of the Netherlands said Sunday that prior to his stay in the Spanish Embassy, Gonzalez had spent weeks in the Dutch embassy in Caracas, moving in a day after the July 28 election and staying there until early September.

“At (Gonzalez’s) urgent request, the day after the elections, I decided to give him hospitality at the state residence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Caracas for as long as necessary,” the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp said in a statement.

Veldkamp said that in early September, Gonzalez announced his intention to leave both the Dutch embassy and Venezuela “to continue his fight from Spain.”

The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said Gonzalez was at the “residence of the Netherlands in Caracas” until September 5.

The Dutch foreign minister said he stressed to Gonzalez the “importance of the opposition’s work and the transition to democracy” but “despite everything, he expressed his desire to leave and continue his fight from Spain.”

Threat to life

Gonzalez’s lawyer Jose Vicente Haro has previously told CNN his client had not sought refuge in an embassy. However, he told CNNE on Sunday that due to his client’s need “to defend his life and personal safety” Gonzalez had taken “different decisions from what he had originally wished for.”

Haro said the decision to leave Venezuela was reached only late on Friday evening and followed “privileged and confidential information” about potential danger to his life.

The lawyer said Gonzalez only had two options: “prison unjustly for crimes he didn’t commit” or “preserve his life” and abandon the country.

Asked why Gonzalez chose Spain, Haro said he “assumes” it’s because one of Gonzalez’s daughters lives there.

His daughter was seen Sunday outside the Torrejon de Ardoz military air base in Madrid, after Gonzalez and his wife arrived on a Spanish military plane.

The lawyer said the situation outside Argentina’s embassy wasn’t a major factor in Gonzalez’s decision to seek asylum, but it was something Gonzalez considered.

On Friday, Venezuelan security forces surrounded the Argentine embassy in Caracas after two opposition members took refuge inside, joining four others who took refuge there earlier this year.

“Many aspects were taken into account, if we had a siege situation in the Argentine embassy, we could have a situation in any embassy accredited in Venezuela,” Haro said.

‘Forced into exile’

The Organization of American States (OAS) said Sunday that Gonzalez had effectively been “forced into exile” after an arrest warrant was issued by Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office last Monday.

The Prosecutor’s Office had accused him of “crimes associated with terrorism” in relation to the disputed election and said he had failed to respond to three summons regarding its investigation into an opposition website that posted results from the contested vote.

When asked about the “coercion and threats” that Gonzalez said led to his decision to request asylum in Spain, Venezuela’s Attorney General said on Sunday that the pressure and threats came from opposition leader María Corina Machado.

“Gonzalez was the victim of pressure from his party that forced him to make decisions,” he said. “There is an absolute fracture in that extremist opposition.” CNN has reached out to Machado for comment.

Though the Venezuelan government says it “allowed” Gonzalez to leave, it has not explained why it granted safe passage to a citizen wanted by the justice system, other than saying it was for the sake of political peace. The Maduro government has granted similar safe passages to opposition leaders in the past, with critics accusing it of silencing the opposition through enforced absence.

The OAS said Gonzalez “only did what was required” by the Venezuelan government’s actions.

“The (Maduro) regime has not only failed to produce the slightest evidence of an electoral result but has forced into exile the candidate Edmundo Gonzalez,” the OAS said in a statement.

The United States has pressured the Venezuelan government to release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory. It has also seized one of Maduro’s planes, saying it was bought in violation of US sanctions.

Opposition figure Juan Pablo Guanipa posted on his X account that, though Gonzalez had left, the opposition must continue “fighting” to ensure that their claimed election win is respected.

“The important thing is that he was elected, that his election was proven and that popular sovereignty must be respected,” he said."
europe,"‘Russian spy’ whale probably died after stick became lodged in its mouth, police say",2024-09-09,Story Reuters,"Oslo, Norway Reuters —

A beluga whale discovered with a harness strapped around its neck in Norwegian waters five years ago – and found dead on August 31 – had a stick stuck in its mouth and its death was not related to human activity, police said on Monday.

The body of Hvaldimir – a combination of the Norwegian word for whale and the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin – was spotted a week ago floating in the sea by a father and son fishing in southern Norway.

The animal became the subject of media attention when it was discovered off Norway’s Arctic coast in 2019 wearing a harness with what appeared to be a mount for a small camera.

Norway and Russia share a maritime border in the Arctic, leading to jokes that the whale was a Russian spy.

Norwegian police had opened an investigation into the death of the animal after two animal rights groups filed a complaint.

An autopsy showed a stick measuring 35 centimeters in length (14 inches) and 3 centimeters wide (1.2 inches) was stuck in the whale’s mouth, police for the South West district said in a statement.

“The autopsy showed that its stomach was empty. In addition, most organs had broken down,” police said.

“There is nothing in the investigations that have been carried out to establish that it is human activity that has directly led to Hvaldimir’s death.”

As a result, police would not investigate further, they added.

The animal rights groups had alleged the whale had been shot dead. On Monday, police said Hvaldimir had sustained some injuries but that they were “completely superficial,” adding “there was no evidence suggesting that Hvaldimir was shot.”

A full report will be ready in two weeks, it said."
middleeast,"Airstrikes hit Syrian facility that West alleged produced chemical weapons, eyewitness says",2024-09-08,"Hamdi Alkhshali, Eyad Kourdi","Alleged Israeli airstrikes in central Syria on Sunday night struck a facility claimed by the West to have produced chemical weapons, according to a local resident.

The strikes killed at least 18 people and injured 37 others, state-run Syrian news agency SANA said Monday, citing the director of Masyaf National Hospital. SANA reported that there had been several explosions in the central Tartous and Hama governorates, including in the Masyaf countryside.

A Masyaf resident, who requested anonymity for security reasons, described to CNN hearing several explosions late Sunday night.

“About half an hour before midnight, multiple airstrikes targeted the Syrian Military Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) and several nearby buildings. I heard at least eight explosions, followed by the sound of ambulances,” the resident said.

Western governments sanctioned a number of officials working at the SSRC in 2017 for their alleged involvement in a Syrian government project to make and deploy the deadly sarin chemical agent.

About 30 minutes after the initial barrage, the witness said they heard more explosions. Neighbors told the resident that at least four civilians, including three members of the same family, were killed in the airstrikes.

When asked by CNN about the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it does not comment “on reports in the foreign media.”

The resident also said they witnessed the aftermath of the strike while crossing Al-Waraqqa highway, noting two destroyed cars and an overturned, damaged bobcat vehicle.

The director of health in Hama, Dr. Maher Al-Younes, told SANA that the strikes on the Masyaf countryside had killed at least 16 people and injured 36 others, with six of those in critical condition.

The Syrian news agency cited a military source as saying “the Israeli enemy launched an air aggression from the direction of northwest Lebanon, targeting a number of military sites in the central region” shortly before 8.30 p.m. local time on Sunday.

A photo released by Syrian state news agency SANA on Sunday, September 8, shows the Wadi al-Uyun highway in Masyaf, where a fire reportedly caused by Israeli airstrikes has broken out. SANA

The source said Syrian air defenses had intercepted and shot down some of the missiles.

SANA said the strikes had damaged the Wadi al-Uyun highway in Masyaf and caused a blaze that firefighters were working to control.

Western intelligence agencies have previously claimed that a branch of the SSRC and surrounding buildings near Masyaf was used to produce chemical weapons, violating the Chemical Weapons Convention.

In 2017 the US Treasury sanctioned 271 Syrian scientific studies and research center staff in response to a sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun in northwest Syria.

The US Treasury at the time said these SSRC employees had expertise in chemistry and related disciplines and/or worked in support of SSRC’s chemical weapons program since at least 2012.

The Syrian government has denied the allegation. However, the facility was reportedly targeted by a suspected Israeli strike in September 2017, a day after a chemical attack on a rebel-held town in northern Syria, which the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons attributed to the Syrian air force.

When he was Israeli defense minister in 2022, Benny Gantz said that: “Under the vision of (former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander) Qasem Soleimani, Iran transformed CERS (SSRC) into production facilities for mid- and long-range precise missiles and weapons, provided to Hezbollah and Iranian proxies. In other words, it became yet another Iranian front – a factory for advanced, strategic weapons.”

“These sites, particularly the underground facility at Masyaf, host significant threats to the region and to the State of Israel,” Gantz added. “Masyaf, specifically, is used to produce advanced missiles.” It has been hit several times by the Israeli Air Force.

Israel has launched airstrikes in Syria intermittently since Hamas’ October 7 attacks last year – and Israel’s ensuing war against the militant group in Gaza – dramatically escalated tensions in the region, and sparked daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah across the Israeli-Lebanese border.

Hezbollah, which has attacked Israel in solidarity with Hamas, has maintained a strong presence in Syria since the 2011 Arab Spring protests, which in some parts of the Middle East spiraled into proxy wars. The Lebanese militant group was an active participant, fighting alongside Iran-aligned forces in Syria and on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who brutally quashed the opposition.

In June, an Israeli airstrike near Aleppo killed an Iranian military adviser, Iranian media reported at the time.

And in April, Israel’s bombing of Iran’s embassy complex in Syria sparked a major confrontation between Iran and Israeli, bringing the Middle East to the brink of all-out war.

australia,Hunt widens for suspect who allegedly threw scalding coffee on baby in Australia,2024-09-09,Hilary Whiteman,"Brisbane, Australia CNN —

A man wanted for allegedly throwing scalding coffee on a baby in an unprovoked attack at a park in the northern Australian state of Queensland is now the subject of an international manhunt.

Queensland Police Detective Inspector Paul Dalton said Monday that officers were working with international partners to find the man, identified as a 33-year-old foreign national, who is known to have fled the country four days after the alleged attack.

A nine-month-old boy, known only as Luka, suffered serious burns on his face, arms and legs when the man allegedly threw the piping hot drink on him as he sat with his mother on the grass at Hanlon Park in Brisbane on August 27.

Closed circuit television video released by police shows the man running from the scene, wearing a blue plaid shirt, black hat and glasses.

Dalton said early investigations were delayed by false information about the man’s name and the suspect’s own surveillance of the police operation.

This picture released by Queensland Police shows a man they claim poured hot coffee on a baby in a Brisbane park. Queensland police

“It soon became apparent to us that this person was aware of police methodologies, was certainly conducting counter surveillance activities, which made the investigation quite complex,” Dalton told reporters.

After the attack, the man took a cab to Brisbane’s city center, then drove by car across the state border to New South Wales before flying from Sydney Airport on August 31.

“It wasn’t until the first of September that we were able to put a name to the face in the CCTV,” said Dalton, who declined to name the man or his destination for fear of hampering the investigation.

Dalton said police had identified the man shortly after he fled, telling reporters: “I was in the investigation center when we put a name to the face, and it was a very happy room, only for us to do a check in 15 minutes and find out we lost him.”

Dalton described the man as an “itinerant worker” who had come and gone from Australia on various visas since 2019 and had last entered the country in January 2022.

Police have been unable to determine the man’s motive.

“I’m continually scratching my head. We can’t find a motive,” Dalton said. “A rational, normal person, you would think, wouldn’t do something like that. But that’s not always the case.”

Police say the man fled Australia a few days after the attack. Queensland police

The boy’s mother, who can’t be identified for legal reasons, told local media at the time it was “all very quick and chaotic.”

“I didn’t really understand what had happened at the time, but I just started screaming for help and yelling out that it was hot and that my son was burnt,” said the mother.

Onlookers rushed over with water to douse the child before he was taken to hospital, where he has since reportedly undergone multiple surgeries for severe burns to his chin, neck, chest and back.

At the time, police released CCTV video of the man with a request for people who recognized him to come forward.

“The footage is quite clear. I’m very confident that if you’re looking at that footage and you know that person in there, you’re going to know who it is,” Dalton told media on August 28.

The investigation took police to New South Wales and Victoria, where the man had lived at several addresses on various work and holiday visas.

Police said they’d spoken to his colleagues about his movements."

europe,"Lviv: In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike",2024-09-04,"Ivana Kottasová, Svitlana Vlasova","Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —

Writing in her college application letter, Daryna Bazylevych described her family as “incredibly close knit and harmonious.” She spoke of her parents’ infinite support and the way they told stories about Ukraine’s history to her and her sisters. “They are the strongest pillar in my life and they help me overcome any obstacle,” she wrote.

Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday.

According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said.

It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place.

The deaths of the three sisters and their mother caused a huge outpouring of grief among people in Lviv and across Ukraine.

Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said the eldest girl, Yaryna, worked in the town hall as part of the “Lviv - Youth Capital of Europe 2025” initiative.

Daryna, the middle sister, was a scholarship student of Ukrainian culture at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. She had just began her second year.

“This is a great and irreparable loss. There are no words that can describe this grief. Let us pray for the souls of the innocent victims. Let us pray for Yaroslav, the father,” the university said in a statement.

Yevhenia, the mother, and the two older girls were members of the Ukrainian Scouts movement. In a statement, the Scouts described Yevhenia as a “creative, intelligent, positive and bright personality.”

Tragic week for Ukraine

The staircase where the Bazylevyches died was meant to be a safe place in a safe city.

Lviv lies in western Ukraine, near the border with Poland, and it has always been seen as one of the safest places in the country.

Tens of thousands of internally displaced people from eastern parts of Ukraine are living in Lviv. Russia is far away, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach the city – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down.

It has been an exceptionally deadly week for Ukraine — the four members of the Bazylevych family were among seven people killed in Lviv on Wednesday. On Tuesday, two Russian missiles hit a military educational facility in Poltava, killing 53 people and injuring more than 270 others."

Writing in her college application letter, Daryna Bazylevych described her family as “incredibly close knit and harmonious.” She spoke of her parents’ infinite support and the way they told stories about Ukraine’s history to her and her sisters. “They are the strongest pillar in my life and they help me overcome any obstacle,” she wrote.

Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday.

According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said.

It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place.

uk,"Grenfell Tower: Britain’s deadliest fire since World War II caused by ‘decades of failure,’ report says",2024-09-04,Christian Edwards,"London CNN —

The blaze that killed 72 people in Grenfell Tower in London was caused by “decades of failure” by the UK government and the construction industry that allowed the 24-storey building to be wrapped in flammable cladding, a seven-year public inquiry has found.

The fire began in the early hours of June 14, 2017, sparked by an electrical fault in a refrigerator on the fourth floor. What could have been a small house fire instead turned into Britain’s deadliest blaze since the Blitz, after the flames leapt to flammable insulation and cladding, which had been added to the tower during a major renovation the previous year.

A 1,700 page report spanning seven volumes laid out a litany of malpractice and negligence, from the cost-cutting measures and “systematic dishonesty” of construction firms to central government’s “deregulatory agenda.”

“The simple truth is that the deaths that occurred were all avoidable,” Martin Moore-Bick, chair of the inquiry, said Wednesday. “Those who lived in the tower were badly failed over a number of years and in a number of different ways, by those who were responsible for ensuring the safety of the building and its occupiers.”

The report concluded that the fire was “the culmination of decades of failure by central government and other bodies in positions of responsibility in the construction industry.”

It also singled out for criticism the Conservative-run local council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the firms which made and sold the cladding, the tenant management company, and others.

Addressing Parliament shortly after the report was released, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the inquiry had found that the Grenfell victims had been failed by “just about every institution responsible for ensuring their safety.”

“It should never have happened,” Starmer said, as some of the bereaved families watched from the parliamentary gallery. “The country failed to discharge its most fundamental duty: To protect you and your loved ones – the people that we are here to serve – and I am deeply sorry.”

Grenfell United, which represents the survivors and bereaved families of those killed in the blaze, said the report marked “a significant chapter in the journey to truth, justice and change,” but “justice has not been delivered.”

“The inquiry report reveals that whenever there’s a clash between corporate interest and public safety, governments have done everything they can to avoid their responsibilities to keep people safe,” it said in a statement. “The system isn’t broken, it was built this way.”

Despite waiting seven years for the final report, victims may have to wait at least another year before its findings result in criminal convictions, London’s Metropolitan Police said.

“To secure justice for those who died and all those affected by the fire we must examine the report – line by line – alongside the evidence from the criminal investigation,” Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said in a statement.

“This will take us at least 12-18 months,” he warned. “I can’t pretend to imagine the impact of such a long police investigation on the bereaved and survivors, but we have one chance to get our investigation right.”

Starmer said the new Labour government will “carefully consider the report and its recommendations, to ensure that such a tragedy cannot occur again.”

The inquiry had taken “longer than we hoped,” Moore-Bick said in a press conference, in part because it “unveiled many more matters of concern than we had previously expected.”

The fire prompted a wave of inspections in similar high-rise buildings across the country, unveiling widespread use of flammable cladding. CNN has previously reported on the plight of homeowners unable to sell their apartments because banks are unwilling to lend against them, citing safety issues."
europe,"‘Ferocious violence’ accompanied ‘shocking’ levels of abuse at Ireland’s religious-run schools, report finds",2024-09-04,Kara Fox,"Nearly 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse across hundreds of Ireland’s religious-run schools have been documented in a new report, marking the latest grim revelations to emerge from the country’s historic Church-State entanglement.

The report, released Tuesday, documented 2,395 allegations of historical child sexual abuse, involving 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools across the country.

Most of the allegations were reported from the records of 42 religious orders that currently run or previously ran schools in Ireland. The scope of the allegations ranges from 1927-2013. More than half the men accused – which include teachers and priests – have died, it said.

Ireland’s Minister for Education Norma Foley said Tuesday that the level of abuse detailed in the report was “truly shocking – and so is the number of alleged abusers.”

She called the report a “harrowing document, containing some of the most appalling accounts of sexual abuse.”

More than 140 survivors provided harrowing testimony for the report, describing being molested, stripped naked, raped and drugged in “an atmosphere of terror and silence.”

Their abuse was often “accompanied by ferocious violence,” the 700-page report said.

Most of the survivors interviewed for the report are men now in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Some said it was the first time they‘d spoken about the abuse and its impact on them, with many saying that their childhood “stopped the day the abuse started.”

Some survivors said the abuse was “so pervasive” that it could not have gone unnoticed by senior leadership within the religious orders that were running the schools. They added that they believed some of those leaders not only ignored the abuse but facilitated and participated in it.

Others said that they believed there had been a “cover-up” in the schools or by the religious order, and “collusion” between the State and Church.

“Many participants said that they felt that the power of the Catholic Church permeated their lives in every way and, for the majority, they felt there was no one they could tell, including their parents,” the report said.

The Catholic Church has been deeply entwined with the Irish state for much of its history. Although a referendum in the 1970s drastically reduced the Church’s political sway, it remained pervasive in many aspects of civil society. Today, nearly 90% of schools in Ireland remain Catholic, even though the percentage of the population that identifies as such is much lower.

Lifelong impact

As adults, survivors detailed a litany of difficulties stemming from the abuse, including failed relationships, mental and physical health problems and addiction issues. Some said that the abuse made them decide not to have children. Others who did said it impacted their parenting.

Many survivors said that they had moved away from family and friends to avoid memories of childhood trauma and described feeling alienated from religious services. Some avoided attending a parent’s funeral or other family event because they said they could not enter a church as a result of the abuse.

A government-mandated investigation into sexual abuse at religious-run boarding and day-schools was first launched after Ireland’s national broadcaster RTÉ aired a documentary in 2022 that highlighted systemic sexual abuse at Blackrock College, a prestigious private school in Dublin.

The report found that the abuse was spread across public and private schools, including 17 special education schools – which recorded 590 allegations involving 190 alleged abusers.

Foley said on Tuesday that the Irish government would begin a process of establishing a commission to further investigate the abuse and that a redress scheme would be established.

She said that religious orders have a “moral obligation” to contribute to any future redress scheme.

Meanwhile, those religious orders have not committed to contribute to the Mother and Baby Homes redress scheme, which opened for applications earlier this year.

The 2021 Mother and Baby Homes report found that 9,000 babies and children died in 18 of Ireland’s mother and baby homes – church-run institutions where unmarried women were sent to deliver their babies in secret, often against their will – over eight decades.

The religious congregations who ran Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries – workhouses where thousands of women and girls lived and worked without pay for years in “harsh and physically demanding” situations – have also declined to contribute to a State redress scheme set up in 2013 to compensate the survivors of those institutions."
europe,"Poltava, Ukraine: Dozens killed in Russian strike on military educational facility",2024-09-03,"Ivana Kottasová, Svitlana Vlasova, Kosta Gak","A Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 51 people and injured more than 200 others, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said preliminary information indicated two ballistic missiles hit the facility in the city of Poltava and a nearby hospital on Tuesday morning.

“We say again and again to everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not somewhere in a warehouse,” Zelensky said in a statement.

The head of the Poltava region military administration, Filip Pronin, announced the latest death toll on Telegram, adding that that rescue crews continue to clear and search through the debris at the site. Pronin said authorities believe up to 18 more people may be under the rubble.

At least 10 residential buildings were also damaged in Poltava, he said.

Moscow has not commented on the attack, but a well-known Russian military blogger Vladimir Rogov reported earlier on Tuesday that Russia struck a military school in Poltava.

Speaking about the attack, President Zelensky repeated his call on Ukraine’s Western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses and lift restrictions on his country’s military using their weapons to strike inside Russia.

“Long-range strikes that can protect against Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he added.

‘We will never forget this’

Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the missile reached the target in a very short period of time. People were struck down as they were trying to get into the bomb shelter, officials said.

“The only way to intercept them was to have the Patriot system or a SAMP/T air defense system because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles,” said Kuleba, who added that he originally came from the Poltava region.

Ukraine has received a handful of Patriot air defense systems from the United States and Germany, although Kyiv has consistently said the number was insufficient to allow it to effectively defend itself.

The Biden administration said in June it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival.” But Kuleba made it clear on Tuesday that new weapons cannot come soon enough.

“I don’t know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made,” Kuleba added, reiterating Zelensky’s calls for more defense systems to be sent to Ukraine.

Local authorities said Tuesday was a “terrible day for Poltava” and declared three days of mourning. No more details would be released about the strike due to “security issues,” they said.

Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, described the attack as a “terrible tragedy for the whole of Ukraine,” as Western allies condemned the scale and force of the Russian strike.

“My deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the Russian missile attack on Poltava,” Zelenska said. “Russia is taking away our most valuable asset – our lives. We will never forget this.”

British Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid tribute to those killed, in a post on X. “Russia’s strikes on Poltava are the latest sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. “We stand with Ukraine.”

europe,France rape trial: Husband accused of repeatedly drugging and having wife raped,2024-09-03,"Camille Knight, Emmanuel Miculita, Caroline Baum","A man is on trial accused of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, as well as encouraging dozens of other men to rape her in their home while she was unconscious, court documents show.

The alleged victim, Gisèle, 72, appeared in a courtroom in Avignon, France, on Monday for the opening of the trial, sunglasses on, her daughter and two sons by her side.

For the next four months, she will come face to face with her accused abusers, most of whom are complete strangers to her.

Prosecutors say the defendant, Dominique, 71, would recruit men online to rape his wife, after drugging her with sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. CNN is not using the full names of the man and wife to protect the identities of other family members.

He faces nine charges including several counts of rape with aggravating circumstances, the drugging of a victim to commit rape, and the sharing of images related to those assaults.

Prosecutors were able to put together a case because Dominique documented a number of the alleged assaults on camera.

Held in pre-trial detention since 2020, courtroom sketches show the defendant entered the courtroom in a black t-shirt and sat facing his wife.

“He recognizes that he’s done what he has done,” his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro told journalists in court on Monday. “There was not an ounce of contestation during the whole investigation.”

In the dock, the men accused of taking part in these rapes sat with their heads down.

Police have identified at least 92 sexual assaults committed by 72 men, with ages ranging from 26 to 74, court documents show.

Fifty were identified, and most have been charged with either aggravated or attempted rape and are standing trial alongside Gisèle’s husband.

The ordeal lasted almost ten years, the first alleged assaults dating back to 2011.

The crimes came to light in 2020 when Dominique was caught filming under women’s skirts in a shopping center.

After police seized his phone and computer, they say they found evidence of the rapes. An investigation was opened and the wife was made aware of the abuse she had endured for almost ten years.

Court documents show that Dominique has told investigators that the other men were all aware his wife had been drugged without her knowledge, something a number of the other defendants deny.

Christophe Huguenin-Virchaux, a lawyer for one of the men told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday that his client “admits that sexual relations did in fact take place” but that they took place as part of a “sexual game between a husband and his wife that he was invited to,” adding that he was “not aware that Gisèle was drugged or under medication.”

Throughout the trial, Gisèle will see and hear what was done to her.

On Tuesday, she sat through a reading of the horrific acts she was subjected to, as well as the arguments from each of the defendants’ lawyers.

“It was very difficult,” one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau told CNN on Tuesday. “It was unbearable for her to hear people say they thought she was pretending to sleep and were convinced it was consensual,” he added.

Last Friday ahead of the trial, another one of her lawyers, Antoine Arebalo-Camus told reporters “she had no idea what had been inflicted on her, so she has no memory of the rapes she suffered for 10 years.”

Gisèle could have requested the trial be held privately, but Babonneau told CNN “she wanted it to be a public trial so that everyone can hear and get an idea of the excuses given by men in such circumstances.”

Gisèle’s daughter says her mother sought medical advice for the memory loss and extreme fatigue she was experiencing as a side effect of the drugs.

Speaking to French media in several interviews, she said that her mother “saw doctors, she saw neurologists,” and that the medical profession failed to detect the problem.

The daughter has now started an awareness campaign called “M’endors Pas,” meaning “Don’t put me to sleep” on drug-facilitated sexual assault.

The trial began on September 2 in the southern French town of Avignon, and a verdict is due on December 20 this year."
europe,At least 12 dead after boat carrying migrants sinks in the English Channel,2024-09-03,"Emmanuel Miculita, Chris Liakos","At least 12 people died, most of them women and children, when a migrant boat capsized off the coast of northern France on Tuesday, according to French authorities.

Nearly 70 people were on board the vessel, according to Boulogne-sur-Mer mayor, Frédéric Cuvillier. The exact number is unclear.

Emergency crews rescued 53 people and recovered the bodies of the dead, the maritime prefecture said. Several of those saved were in critical condition and required urgent medical care.

Three helicopters, two fishing vessels and two boats have been deployed in the search and rescue operation.

The incident is the latest in a number of tragedies on the English Channel, where small boat crossings of migrants attempting to reach Britain has soared in recent years.

“This maritime sector is one of the busiest areas in the world, with more than 600 merchant ships passing through it every day and the weather conditions are often difficult, so it is a particularly dangerous sector, even when the sea seems calm,” the prefecture said.

Most of the migrants on board appeared to be from Eritrea, the Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor, Guirec Le Bras, said Tuesday. He added that 10 of the 12 who died were women and some were minors.

Le Bras said it appears that the boat sank about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the coast of Cap Gris-Nez, on the northern coast of France.

French interior minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters in Boulogne-sur-Mer on Tuesday that “less than eight people had a life jacket” on board the boat, as he pointed the finger at smugglers for the unsafe conditions.

“Obviously, it is a tragedy. As soon as a person loses their life on our territory, I would obviously like to have a compassionate thought for their families,” Darmanin added. “They were undoubtedly looking for a better world in Great Britain.”

Nearly 30,000 people reached Britain by crossing the Channel in a small boat last year, according to Home Office figures, with dinghies and other small vessels frequently being used to take large groups of people on the dangerous journey in the hope of seeking asylum in the United Kingdom.

Deadly incidents like Tuesday’s have occurred on a number of occasions during that time. Last August, six people died when a boat carrying dozens of migrants capsized.

The issue became a major political obstacle for the previous Conservative government, which was criticized by migrant rights groups for its hardline rhetoric against asylum seekers, and for the new Labour administration.

The head of the French mission for Médecins Sans Frontières, Xavier Crombé, on Tuesday blamed the policies of the French and British governments for the latest deaths.

“We are shocked and angry after this new tragedy in the English Channel,” Crombé said. “These deaths are not inevitable, but the tragic consequence of inhumane and absurd migration policies.”

Crombé said that current policies prioritize border control rather than human lives, making migrant journeys “more precarious and dangerous.”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement they were acting “following intelligence that a number of Palestinian suspects were present in the convoy” and delayed it to question them.

The IDF said the convoy was not involved in the transport of polio vaccines but was being used instead to exchange UN personnel.

middleeast,Gaza hostage families urge Trump and Harris to bring Americans home,2024-09-09,"Matthew Chance, Yon Pomrenze","Tel Aviv CNN —

Ahead of a key US presidential debate this week, families of several American hostages held in Gaza are calling on US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to offer new ideas for securing the immediate release of their loved ones.

“We want to hear that they care. We want to hear that both candidates understand and acknowledge there are seven Americans still in captivity, and that the US is fully committed to bringing them back,” Ronen Neutra, a US-Israeli dual citizen from New York, told CNN. His 22-year-old son, Omer, is a serving Israeli soldier and was abducted by Hamas during the October 7 attacks.

CNN spoke with relatives of three US citizens held in Gaza who all expressed frustration that attempts to free their family members over the past 11 months had so far failed.

“Enough is enough,” said Adi Alexander, whose 20-year-old son Edan was serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7.

“Perhaps the deal proposed by President (Joe) Biden back in December was good then, but maybe we need something different now,” he added.

All the family members who spoke to CNN said they were looking to the Biden administration as well as Trump and Harris to find creative ways to increase pressure on Hamas and Israel to reach a new deal.

“I would challenge the candidates and ask them, you know, how to get our kids back,” said Ruby Chen, another US-Israeli citizen whose 19-year-old son, Itay, was killed during the attacks last year. His body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza.

“We want to hear new ideas from both candidates and for them to commit to adopting a fresh approach to all the players,” Chen told CNN.

The family members told CNN that approach should include the US seeking new pressure points on Hamas and its sponsor Iran, as well as on other nations with potential influence, like Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, the Gulf state which hosts Hamas officials and has helped facilitate negotiations.

Incentives, such as trade deals, sanctions relief and international prisoner swaps should also be evaluated, the hostage families told CNN, similar to recent deals agreed between Washington and Moscow to free US citizens such as Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and US basketball star Brittney Griner

“They showed great creativity in a complex deal they did for Evan Gershkovich and working an international deal with Germany and other countries to bring American citizens back home,” Alexander told CNN.

“Our children may be not as famous as a basketball player, but you know, from our perspective, the creativity they have shown has to come back again here in our case, and to do everything possible, everything within their means – whether it’s putting more pressure, whether it’s finding creative ways to bring our kids back home.”

There is even support among the relatives of the US hostages for Washington to apply greater pressure on Israel, whose veteran prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is accused by critics of thwarting US-led hostage negotiations to appease hardliners in his fragile coalition.

The relatives said they would now support moves to curb US diplomatic, financial and military aid to Israel as a way of pushing Netanyahu toward a deal.

“Without a doubt, more pressure on Bibi Netanyahu should be placed, but I’m not sure there is political will at this point, either from the Biden administration or the Trump campaign, to put more light between them and the Israeli prime minister,” Ronen Neutra told CNN, using a popular nickname for Netanyahu.

“But we are urging our leaders to take brave action and to put politics aside. We are not playing here. This is a real life-and-death situation,” he added.

Over 100 hostages remain in Gaza today, as living conditions in the Palestinian enclave crumble under Israeli forces’ months-long siege. Freed hostages have described suffering from frequent shortages of food and water in Gaza, and some have also reported physical and mental abuse by their captors.

The recovery earlier this month of six murdered hostages’ bodies prompted mass protests in Israel, with demonstrators demanding Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free those who remained in captivity. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand.

Instead, a defiant Netanyahu has doubled down on his strategy in the strip, stressing his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeating his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a significant new sticking point in talks to reach a deal."

Jerusalem and Gaza CNN —

A 14-year-old boy lies in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, Gaza Strip, severely burned from an Israeli airstrike. Doctors say nearly his entire body is affected. His wounds have now become infested with maggots.

“(He has) advanced second- and third-degree burns covering 80% to 90% of his body,” Dr. Mahmoud Yousef Mughani, a doctor specializing in reconstructive surgery and burns, told CNN. Due to a shortage of sterilization supplies, his wounds can’t be cleaned properly.

When the boy’s dressings are changed, maggots fall to the floor. This happens every time, Dr. Mughani said.

There’s nowhere else for the boy to go. According to the United Nations, an estimated 12,000 patients are waiting to leave Gaza to receive urgently needed medical care, but medical evacuations have been suspended since the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt four months ago.

This case is a testament to the deteriorating sanitary conditions for the Palestinians trapped in the besieged enclave after 11 months of war, both within and outside hospitals.

Even as the campaign to vaccinate Gaza’s children for polio continues, the United Nations and aid agencies warn of deteriorating public health conditions.

On Sunday, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the UN body in charge of the Palestinian territories, said on X: “While we vaccinate children against polio, many other diseases continue spreading in Gaza.”

“Piles of trash grow higher next to tents & shelters. Sewage keeps flooding the streets. Access to hygiene products is increasingly limited. Sanitary conditions are inhumane,” UNRWA said.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned last week that limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities, coupled with the lack of affordable hygiene items, was aggravating Gaza’s public health crisis.

In July, the price of soap had reportedly increased by nearly 1,200% across the strip from a year earlier, with the price of shampoo almost 500% higher in the same period, OCHA said.

“Humanitarian partners have been working to ensure that hundreds of thousands of hygiene kits can reach people in need, but those efforts continue to be hampered by active conflict, access restrictions, the lack of public order and safety, and evacuation orders issued by Israeli authorities,” OCHA said.

Families who have been displaced face extreme difficulties in maintaining basic hygiene in overcrowded shelters and displacement sites, the agency said, while critical facilities, such as health centers, community kitchens, child-protection spaces, nutrition centers, and schools, lack the necessary tools to ensure safe and sanitary conditions. This situation is likely to deteriorate further during the winter.

Selling homemade soap

Some residents have taken to making soap and detergents, and selling them.

Mohammed Al-Taweel has a stall at a street market in Deir Al-Balah. He told CNN Sunday that “people began to demand detergents more, and we began to increase producing these.”

“There is no alternative. There is nothing that can be brought in. There is nothing ready-made. Everything is closed,” Al-Taweel said.

But he was worried that the raw materials may also run out in the coming days.

“The ready-made product was cheap and available, but everything is expensive… People complain.”

“The shampoo is 15 shekels ($4). We used to sell it for 10 shekels.”

Ghada Shahoura, a woman at the market looking for cleaning products, told CNN: “The shortage of cleaning materials is severe. We are forced to buy local cleaning materials.”

But she said they were often poor quality and very expensive.

“We have epidemics and a high (rate of) infections, parasites and fungal infections in children. There is no hygiene,” Shahoura said.

UN agencies and partners are attempting to restore wells that were damaged due to fighting in Deir Al-Balah in late August, which reduced groundwater production by 75%. Eight wells were significantly damaged, four of which cannot be repaired at present, OCHA said.

As of this month, daily clean water production in the enclave was at a quarter of pre-war supply, OCHA said, citing agencies involved in public health in Gaza.

The volume of water transported through trucking operations however doubled between 19 August and 1 September. Even so, it is far less than can be generated from wells – and delivery has been hampered by fuel shortages and persistent traffic congestion in the AlMawasi area, where thousands of internally displaced have moved.

Saeed Rayyan, a Gaza resident, sells chlorine to sterilize tents and clothes.

“It is also used for washing and sterilizing dishes because of hepatitis, which is spreading terribly in the Gaza Strip, and to deter jaundice,” Rayyan told CNN.

Supplies of liquid chlorine were hard to come by, he said, so they often had to resort to powdered chlorine and caustic soda to try to preserve hygiene.

“There are no alternative materials to eliminate diseases. There is no shampoo,” Rayyan added. People used dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent to try to stay clean.

“Due to the spread of epidemics and diseases and the lack of cleanliness in the tents, as well as the large accumulation of garbage in the country, there is no cleaning… of the bathrooms and there is no (hygiene) supervision in the markets in general,” he said.

Children face uncertainty

The new school year in Gaza was meant to begin on Monday, but OCHA says more than 600,000 students have no access to formal education or safe learning spaces as the war grinds on.

None of the 200 schools run by the UN’s Palestinian humanitarian relief, UNWRA, in Gaza, are running as many of them are serving as shelters for displaced Palestinians, OCHA added.

Some children have relied on makeshift classrooms to help continue their education. At one such classroom, inside a tent in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, a group of 17 children gather to learn the Arabic alphabet.

The tent belongs to Arabic teacher Oula Al Goul, who says she is teaching first graders out of a sense of responsibility. “I decided to launch this individual initiative to save whatever can be saved and help those children who have not been attending school,” she told CNN.

The scarcity of fuel has limited the operation of hospitals and has impacted the effort to vaccinate Gaza’s children against polio, with a lack of fuel for vehicles involved in the vaccination campaign, Mahmoud Shalabi, an aid worker with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) told CNN.

Aid agencies have also raised concerns about the impact of the new Israeli military evacuation orders on the vaccination campaign. On Monday, the Israeli military ordered residents to evacuate areas of northern Gaza where it had previously agreed a pause in fighting to allow children to receive polio vaccinations, according to a UN body.

The order came after rockets were launched from northern Gaza toward Ashkelon in southern Israel on Sunday. OCHA criticized the order, noting it included “areas where local pauses (in fighting) had been agreed for polio vaccination.” According to the government media office in Gaza, the current population of the areas affected by the evacuation order is about 15,000.

“The Ministry of Health is unsure how to proceed with these areas since the population is moving out and the designated vaccination centers are now in red zones,” Shalabi added."
middleeast,"Three killed in Israeli airstrike were emergency workers, Lebanon says. Israel says it targeted terrorists",2024-09-07,Hamdi Alkhshali,"Three people were killed and two wounded in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, authorities in the country said Saturday.

The Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said three emergency workers were killed in the attack as they tried to contain a fire in the town of Froun, Nabatieh district. It said the attack was the second time an ambulance team had been targeted within 12 hours and was a violation of international law.

However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike had “eliminated terrorists” from the Amal movement, a Hezbollah-allied Shia group. The Amal movement released a statement saying two of its members had been killed “while performing their humanitarian and national duty in defense of Lebanon and the South.”

Hezbollah said in a statement Sunday that its fighters “bombed the Kiryat Shmona settlement” with a salvo of missiles in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, singling out the airstrike that killed the three emergency workers.

The IDF said early Sunday that about 50 “projectiles” were launched from southern Lebanon toward Kiryat Shmona in upper Galilee, Israel’s northernmost territory. Most were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, it said.

The Israeli military said Sunday its air force struck Hezbollah military structures overnight in the areas of Aitaroun, Maroun El Ras, and Yaroun in southern Lebanon. It also said it struck and “eliminated terrorists” from the Amal movement in the area of Froun.

Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati characterized Saturday’s deadly airstrike as “a blatant violation of international laws and a blatant aggression against human values,” and called on Western ambassadors and other international representatives to attend an emergency meeting at his headquarters in Beirut on Monday.

He said the meeting aimed to demand accountability and “pressure the Israeli enemy that does not care about any law and continues to ignite the fire of its crimes against Lebanon and the Lebanese.”

Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began.

Lebanon’s Civil Defense director Brigadier General Raymond Khattar extended his “deepest condolences” to the families of those affected.

He also wished a “speedy recovery” to one of the injured men, whom the Civil Defense identified as Mohammad Amasha. The injured man had been “transferred to Tebnin Governmental Hospital, where he is undergoing surgery due to a serious injury he sustained as a result of the raid,” the Civil Defense said."
middleeast,"Aysenur Eygi: Family of American killed in West Bank blames Israel for her death, demands independent investigation",2024-09-07,"Avery Schmitz, Amanda Musa, Lucas Lilieholm, James Legge","The family of an American woman shot and killed while protesting in the occupied West Bank has blamed Israel for her death and called for an independent investigation, saying in a statement that an Israel-led probe would be inadequate.

Two eyewitnesses told CNN that Aysenur Eygi was shot in the head by Israeli forces responding to a protest near the city of Nablus on Friday. The 26-year-old had been participating in a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita, they added.

Nablus Governor Ghassan Daghlas told CNN Saturday that an autopsy conducted at Al Najah University had “confirmed that Eygi was killed by an Israeli occupation sniper’s bullet to her head.”

CNN cannot independently verify the autopsy results, but has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.

Previously, the Israeli military had admitted firing at the demonstrators, and a US National Security Council spokesperson said that the US had contacted Israeli officials to “request an investigation into the incident.”

But the family said that would not be enough.

“We welcome the White House’s statement of condolences, but given the circumstances of Aysenur’s killing, an Israeli investigation is not adequate,” the statement read.

“We call on President (Joe) Biden, Vice President (Kamala) Harris, and Secretary of State (Antony) Blinken to order an independent investigation into the unlawful killing of a US citizen and to ensure full accountability for the guilty parties.”

The statement also said Eygi “was killed by a bullet that video shows came from an Israeli military shooter.”

Eygi held both US and Turkish citizenship. US officials are looking into the deadly incident, and the Turkish government has said it holds Israel responsible for her death.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told an event in Istanbul on Saturday that Israel had “heinously murdered our young child.”

Eygi, who graduated from the University of Washington this spring, had been volunteering with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), the same pro-Palestinian activist group as Rachel Corrie, a US citizen killed in 2003 while trying to block an Israeli bulldozer from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza.

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its troops “responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them.”

The IDF is “looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area,” the statement added.

The ISM said none of its members threw rocks during the protest.

“Aysenur was more than 200 meters away from where the Israeli soldiers were, and there were no confrontations there at all in the minutes before she was shot,” it said in a statement.

“Regardless, from such distance, neither she, nor anyone else could have possibly been perceived as posing any threat. She was killed in cold blood.”

‘She was gentle, brave’

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was working to “gather the facts” of Eygi’s killing and offered condolences to her family – but did not suggest any immediate policy changes related to her death.

Even when there have been determinations that Israeli forces were responsible for the killings of Americans in the West Bank – such as Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh – the US has not altered its policies and has continued to provide significant military support to those forces.

National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said earlier the US was “deeply disturbed” by Eygi’s killing. “We have reached out to the Government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident,” he added.

US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew confirmed that Eygi, who was born in Turkey, was the victim and said the embassy was “urgently gathering more information about the circumstances of her death.”

Turkey’s Foreign Ministry condemned Eygi’s death, saying it held the Israeli government responsible and confirming she was also a Turkish citizen. “We will follow up on bringing those who killed our citizens to justice,” spokesperson Oncu Keceli said.

The family’s statement commemorated Eygi as “a fiercely passionate human rights activist” who had also been active on campus in student-led protests “advocating for human dignity, and calling for an end to the violence against the people of Palestine.”

“Like the olive tree she lay beneath where she took her last breaths, Aysenur was strong, beautiful, and nourishing. Her presence in our lives was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military,” it said.

“Aysenur was a loving daughter, sister, partner, and aunt. She was gentle, brave, silly, supportive, and a ray of sunshine.”

Protests at Beita are common. The Palestinian town is next to a ramshackle Israeli settler outpost known as Evyatar. The settlement was unauthorized by the Israeli state until it was legalized earlier this year. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law."
middleeast,Bedouins in Israel say Gaza war has worsened decades of marginalization,2024-09-07,Nadeen Ebrahim,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.

Khirbet Karkur, Israel CNN —

In southern Israel’s Negev desert, residents of the Bedouin village of Khirbet Karkur live in tents and metal-clad makeshift homes. Not far from the border with Gaza, they hear the sounds of the war unfolding next door.

There are some 300,000 Arab Bedouins living in the Negev. As Muslim-Arab citizens of Israel, many are still struggling to find their place in Israeli society 75 years after the Jewish state was established, despite many of them serving in the military.

The war with Hamas has only deepened that sense of uncertainty. Bedouins living near the Gaza border feel they have been doubly victimized: first by being within striking distance of Hamas rockets with minimal protection, and second by state marginalization that has only grown worse since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel.

The village of Khirbet Karkur is not recognized by the Israeli state. Residents live a semi-nomadic life, in an open desert area and in dwellings that aren’t connected to the Israeli electricity grid or water supply. Like many other unrecognized villages, it has no schools or hospitals, and residents say that women have been forced to give birth in cars on the way to hospital because ambulances struggle to reach the town.

And unlike millions of other Israelis during the war, they don’t have air raid sirens or access to bomb shelters to hide from Hamas’ rockets. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system often skips interceptions above their village, residents say, as it ignores projectiles that aren’t expected to fall in population centers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN it is “not possible to provide details on the aerial defense array policy due to considerations of information security.”

Villagers say the rest of the country had all but forgotten them – until last week, when a swarm of journalists travelled along dirt roads to the dusty village to mark the release of 52-year-old Farhan Al-Qadi from Hamas captivity. Khirbet Karkur is his hometown.

Al-Qadi was abducted along with 250 others by Hamas-led militants on October 7. He was taken from Kibbutz Magen, where he was working as a security guard, and was rescued last week from a tunnel in Gaza by Israeli security forces, the Israeli military said.

Speaking to reporters the day after his rescue, Al-Qadi said he wishes “that the war ends for all Palestinian and Israeli families.”

Israeli officials have said that Al-Qadi’s kidnapping and release shows that all its citizens – Jews and Muslims alike – are equally vulnerable to terrorism, adding that the state is committed to securing the freedom of every citizen.

Israel’s Bedouin community is considered a subset of the country’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population in the country of 10 million.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Al-Qadi the day he was released, and according to a transcript supplied by the Prime Minister’s Office, said: “I want you to know that we do not forget anyone, just as we did not forget you. We are committed to returning everyone, without exception.”

In November, the prime minister visited the IDF’s so-called Bedouin battalion in the Negev, a unit mostly made up of Muslim Bedouin soldiers, saying that “Jewish and Bedouin commanders are standing shoulder-to-shoulder,” and that “our partnership is the future of us all against these savages.”

But some Bedouin leaders and residents of Al-Qadi’s village say the state is celebrating his rescue without taking proper action to address the community’s decades-long needs.

Waleed Alhwashla, a Bedouin member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said that while Netanyahu and his coalition portray Israeli Arabs as equal to Jewish citizens, the reality on the ground is starkly different.

“Netanyahu lies to the families of the hostages, to the world, he lies at negotiations, to (US President Joe) Biden and to America,” Alhwashla told CNN. “He cannot change the reality inside (Israel), where there are violations of freedom, human rights, the rights of the Arab minority,” he said.

‘Displacement and segregation’

The semi-nomadic Bedouin group is predominantly tribal, with family trees that extend into Gaza and Egypt’s northern Sinai. Many identify distinctly as Bedouin Israelis, while others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel.

Unlike most Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to do so anyway, often in specialized units operating in the Negev desert.

Bedouins who join the military receive support from the state to complete high school studies, Hebrew courses and driving lessons. Some also join up to protect the land they live in, Israeli media reported, especially after October 7.

Most Bedouins live in the 4,700-square-mile Negev, which before Israel’s founding in 1948 was home to some 92,000 Bedouins. Only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war that followed.

Today, over 300,000 Bedouin citizens of Israel live in the Negev, including more than 80,000 who reside in unrecognized Bedouin villages, according to Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel. Many of those settlements predate Israel’s founding.

These villages are often situated next to waste dumps, with little access to water and electricity, said Fayez Sohaiban, a relative of Al-Qadi and former mayor of the nearby Bedouin city of Rahat.

“This is a humanitarian issue,” Sohaiban told CNN, adding that all Bedouin families in the Negev suffer the same challenges. “They don’t have schools, they don’t have water, they don’t have power.”

“People are suffocating,” he said.

Residents of unrecognized villages regularly face demolition orders for their buildings due to lack of building permits, they say.

Demolitions have occurred on a “weekly” basis this year, according to the rights group Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality (NCF). In the first half of 2024 alone, 2,007 Bedouin structures were demolished by the state despite a temporary halt in the early months of the war, the group said, up from 1,767 demolitions during the same period of the previous year.

Bedouin residents and leaders say their plight has worsened since the war started.

Alhwashla, the lawmaker, told CNN that the government has “erased” the village of Wadi Al-Khalil during the war, adding that there are “thousands of other orders for demolition” currently in place.

In May, Amnesty International said that Israel had demolished 47 homes in the unrecognized village of Wadi al-Khalil “without proper consultation or compensation,” adding that Israeli authorities have over the years “employed numerous pretexts to push for the displacement and segregation of the Bedouin community in the Negev,” from expanding highways and industrial zones, to establishing forests for the Jewish National Fund and the designation of military zones. A report by the NCF said in the case of Wadi al-Khalil, the demolition was justified by the Israeli state as necessary for the extension of Highway 6, “a project not yet scheduled for construction nor budgeted by the state, despite the humanitarian crisis it caused.”

Bedouin-Israeli communities are also among the poorest in the country, with close to 80% of Bedouin children living below the poverty line, NCF said, citing data from Israel’s National Insurance Institute.

Their plight has worsened significantly since a far-right government came to power in 2022, residents told CNN. In August of last year, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir attended the demolition of an unrecognized village near Tel Arad in the Negev, Israeli media reported. The minister called the demolition “sacred work,” and said the residents should “understand that we govern here, that there are landlords in this country.”

Some villagers are afraid to criticize the government, citing fear of retribution by the authorities, which they say has increased since October 7. Villagers say authorities closely monitor their social media for any signs of support for Palestinians in Gaza, or criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war.

United Nations officials have repeatedly called on Israel to stop demolishing homes and property belonging to the Bedouin community.

CNN has reached out to Israel’s Land Authority for comment.

Victims of October 7

When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 22 Bedouins were killed, seven of them by rocket fire that fell onto unrecognized villages, according to Alhwashla. A total of eight Bedouins were kidnapped, according to the Hostage Families Forum. Three have been freed, one is believed to be dead in Gaza, one was killed by IDF fire while attempting to flee, and three remain in Hamas captivity, according to the forum.

In April, when Israel and Iran traded direct fire for the first time, a 7-year-old Bedouin girl in the Negev was severely wounded by shrapnel from an intercepted missile, according to Israeli officials.

Last week, residents of unrecognized Bedouin villages filed a petition with the High Court of Justice “demanding that the state provide protective measures against rocket and missile fire,” according to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, a partner to the petitioners.

“Approximately 85,000 residents of these unrecognized villages lack any means of protection against rocket, missile, or drone attacks,” the association said, adding that residents have since October 7 been forced to rely on “makeshift protective measures, such as sheltering under bridges, digging trenches, or finding narrow crevices in the ground.”

“These villages are without sirens, Iron Dome coverage, or any formal state-regulated protection, due to their unrecognized status,” the association said, citing the petition.

The IDF told CNN that “the Home Front Command maintains regular contact with the heads of local authority, the Ministry of Social Equality, and the Bedouin Administration to ensure optimal protection whenever possible,” adding that since the beginning of the war, “the Home Front Command has been working to deploy protective measures in the Bedouin dispersal areas.”

Still, Bedouin communities feel that such efforts have done little to alleviate their longstanding hardships.

Despite their Israeli citizenship, they feel underrepresented, neglected and that their plight has even worsened as the war grinds on.

When members of the international community visit villages of the Negev, they are shocked to see citizens of Israel living this way, Sohaiban told CNN.

“We hold the Israeli passport and Israeli ID card. We live in this country and respect the law, so we must be treated the same way Jews are treated,” he said."

A fuel tanker collided head-on with another truck in Nigeria on Sunday causing an explosion that killed at least 48 people, the country’s emergency response agency said.

The fuel tanker was also carrying cattle in the Agaie area in north-central Niger state and at least 50 of them were burned alive, Abdullahi Baba-Arab, director-general of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, said.

Search and rescue operations were underway at the scene of the accident, Baba-Arab said.

Baba-Arab said initially that 30 bodies were found but in a later statement said an additional 18 bodies of victims who were burned to death in the collision were found. He said the dead had been given a mass burial.

Mohammed Bago, governor of Niger state, said residents of the affected area should remain calm and asked road users to “always be cautious and abide by road traffic regulations to safeguard lives and property.”

With the absence of an efficient railway system to transport cargo, fatal truck accidents are common along most of the major roads in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.

africa,Fire contained at girls’ school in Kenya a day after blaze at boys’ dormitory that killed 21,2024-09-07,Jennifer Hauser,"Three people were injured in a fire at a high school for girls in Kenya, authorities in the country reported, just one day after more than 20 people were killed by a blaze at an elementary school for boys.

“Isiolo Girls on fire, several students reportedly trapped inside,” state-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) wrote on X Saturday.

On Sunday, the Kenya Red Cross said on X that the situation at the Isiolo Girls High School in Isiolo county had been contained and that there were three minor injuries.

The fire came a day after a deadly blaze at the Hillside Endarasha Academy in the country’s Nyeri county. Authorities said Saturday the fire at the boys’ dormitory had killed at least 21 people.

Nineteen bodies were recovered from the scene and two other people died after being taken to hospital, government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura said.

africa,"Nyeri, Kenya: 17 students killed in school fire as 70 remain unaccounted for",2024-09-06,Larry Madowo,"At least 17 students have been killed and 14 injured following a fire in an elementary school dormitory in central Kenya, while a further 70 children remain unaccounted for, authorities said Friday.

The inferno occurred late Thursday at the Hillside Endarasha Academy in Kieni, in the country’s Nyeri county, Resila Onyango, a spokesperson for the Kenya National Police Service said. She added their bodies had been “burnt beyond recognition.”

“The cause of fire is unknown at this time but we will update the public when we know more,” Onyango told CNN.

Government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura said in a statement Friday that the fire broke out at around midnight in the male dormitory of the mixed private boarding school, adding that more than 150 boys were in the dormitory at the time.

Kenya’s education ministry said 824 students – 402 boys and 422 girls – were enrolled in the school. It added that 156 of the boys and around 160 girls were boarders while the rest were day scholars.

Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua said that 70 children are still unaccounted for.

“We still have 70 kids that are unaccounted – that does not mean they are perished or they are injured. The word is that they are unaccounted for. We are praying and hoping for the best,” he said at a press conference Friday.

Gachagua said that some parents, hearing the news of the fire, came to the school to collect their children without informing school officials.

“I am appealing to each and every parent who took their child from here to report… so that we know where that child is,” he said.

Kenyan President William Ruto on Friday offered his condolences. Describing the incident as “devastating news,” Ruto said “our thoughts are with the families of the children who have lost their lives in the fire tragedy at the Hillside Endarasha Academy in Nyeri County,” in a post on X.

“I instruct relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate this horrific incident. Those responsible will be held to account,” his post continued, adding his government was “mobilizing all the necessary resources to support the affected families.”

Distraught parents converged on the school Friday morning, waiting anxiously for news as authorities searched for bodies and survivors.

The Kenya Red Cross also posted a statement Friday, saying it would provide “psychosocial support services to the pupils, teachers and affected families.”

The statement added that 11 children have so far been taken to hospital, with the area of the fire cordoned off by police.

Kenya Red Cross, alongside a “multi-agency response team,” is currently on the ground responding add has set up a tracing desk at the school, the statement continued.

School fires – often attributed to arson and overcrowding – are relatively common in Kenya, where similar tragedies have led to multiple casualties in the past.

In 2017, at least nine students died when a boarding school in the capital Nairobi erupted in flames. The government said at the time that the fire “was not an accident” but an “arson,” and part of a rising trend of deliberate school fires. From 2015 to 2016 around 350 schools had caught fire, according to official figures reported by Reuters.

africa,Nigeria: Suspected Boko Haram militants kill at least 37 in northeastern Nigerian village,2024-09-04,Story Reuters,"Reuters —

Suspected Boko Haram Islamist militants roared into a northeastern Nigerian village on motorcycles, opened fire on a market and set shops and homes ablaze, killing at least 37 people, according to a military official.

Residents said the death toll could be even higher, with villagers still missing and feared dead after fighters chased them into the bush.

The attack took place on Sunday afternoon in Yobe, one of three states at the frontline of an insurgency that has lasted 15 years. Thousands of Nigerians have been killed and more than 2 million displaced.

Yobe police spokesperson Dungus Abdulkarim said the attack in Yobe’s Mafa village was apparent retaliation for the killing of two suspected Boko Haram fighters by local vigilantes.

After shooting at the market and torching buildings, the militants chased other residents into the bush and shot them, Abdulkarim added.

“The terrorists killed many people, but we are yet to ascertain the actual number of casualties,” Abdulkarim said.

A military official who accompanied the army’s commanding officer for Yobe to Mafa on Monday evening said the route to the village had been rigged with explosives, which troops managed to defuse.

“We recovered 37 corpses and brought them to Babangida General Hospital,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.

Modu Mohammed, a resident, said several more residents were missing and estimated the death toll at over 100. He said some corpses were still in the bush."
americas,Silvio Almeida: Brazil’s Lula fires human rights minister accused of sexual misconduct,2024-09-07,Associated Press,"Rio de Janeiro AP —

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has fired Human Rights Minister Silvio Almeida following reports he engaged in sexual misconduct.

“The president considers keeping the minister in his position to be unsustainable considering the nature of the accusations,” the presidential palace said in a statement Friday evening. Almeida has denied any wrongdoing.

Local media outlets reported Thursday night that MeToo Brasil, an organization that defends women victims of sexual violence, had received complaints of sexual misconduct by Almeida. The organization confirmed that in a subsequent statement.

The minister for racial equality Anielle Franco - who the press named as one of the alleged victims - saluted Lula’s decision.

“Recognizing the seriousness of this practice and acting immediately is the right course of action, which is why I would like to highlight President Lula’s forceful action and thank him for all the expressions of support and solidarity,” Franco said in a statement on Instagram late on Friday.

She also shot back at attempts to “blame, disqualify, embarrass or pressure victims to speak out in moments of pain and vulnerability,” adding a request that her space and right to privacy be respected. Franco is the sister of slain councilwoman Marielle Franco.

Lula previously said on social media Friday that the public prosecutors’ office, comptroller general and the presidency’s ethics commission would investigate, while guaranteeing Almeida’s right to a defense.

In a statement on Friday, Almeida said he had asked Lula to dismiss him “in order to grant freedom and impartiality to the investigations, which must be carried out with the necessary rigor.”

Almeida said in a statement last night that he repudiates “with absolute vehemence the lies” claimed about his behavior, and denounced a “campaign to tarnish my image as a Black man in a prominent position in government.” He also warned that false accusations are a crime.

Brazil’s first lady Rosângela da Silva — known as Janja — is a prominent voice for the defense of women’s rights, and on Thursday posted a picture on her Instagram account of her kissing Franco on the forehead, in a sign of support.

“As often happens in cases of sexual violence involving aggressors in positions of power, these victims faced difficulties in obtaining institutional support to validate their complaints,” MeToo Brasil said in a statement Thursday. “As a result, they allowed the case to be confirmed to the press.”

Friday afternoon, Isabel Rodrigues, a professor and a city council candidate in a municipality of Sao Paulo state, posted a video Friday on Instagram with the aim of adding her testimonial to those of the yet-unnamed women. She said Almeida sexually assaulted her in 2019, putting his hand up her skirt and touching her private parts without her consent.

“It was horrible what Silvio did. My therapist knows. My friends know. I was Silvio’s victim. I am a voice for these women. For justice and for the truth,” she said."

americas,Venezuelan security forces surround Argentine embassy after opposition members take refuge inside,2024-09-07,"Mauricio Torres, Abel Alvarado","Venezuelan security forces surrounded the Argentine embassy in the capital Caracas on Friday after two opposition members took refuge inside, according to posts by the opposition on social media.

The pair joined four other Venezuelan opposition figures who have taken refuge in the embassy this year.

One of the men, Pedro Urruchurtu, the international coordinator for opposition leader María Corina Machado, wrote on X that there were patrols of hooded and armed officials surrounding the diplomatic building.

The other, former deputy Omar González, also posted on X, writing: “They cut off the electricity service to the Argentine embassy in Caracas, which is currently besieged by agents of the Sebin (Bolivarian National Intelligence Service) and other state security bodies.”

A statement issued by Vente Venezuela, a movement led by Machado, described the situation as a “siege.”

“Patrols with regime agents continue to arrive at the headquarters of the Argentine embassy in Caracas. We hold Nicolás Maduro responsible for this siege against our leaders who are taking refuge in the embassy,” the statement said.

The Argentine government has filed requests for them to be allowed to leave Venezuela but they have not so far been granted.

CNN has reached out to the foreign ministries of Venezuela and Argentina for further information, but is yet to hear back.

CNN has also sought comment from the foreign ministry of Brazil, whose government assumed the protection of the diplomatic building, after Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro expelled Argentine diplomatic personnel from the country.

The expulsions came after Argentina’s government questioned the widely disputed results of the July 28 elections, in which Maduro was proclaimed the winner despite detailed results not being made public as requested by several governments and international organizations.

On Saturday, Venezuela said it had revoked Brazil’s authorization to represent Argentina’s interests in the country, including the protection of the diplomatic building. It claimed the decision was due to evidence that the embassy was being used to plan an attempted “magnicide” against Maduro and his Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.

Venezuela did not elaborate on what the evidence was. It said the decision was effective “immediately.”

Brazil said the move was a “surprise,” adding that it intended to continue to defend Argentine interests until Venezuela and Argentina agreed to another country assuming the functions.

“The Brazilian government highlights in this context, under the terms of the Vienna Conventions, the inviolability of the facilities of the Argentine diplomatic mission, which currently houses six Venezuelan asylum seekers in addition to assets and archives,” the Brazilian government said in a statement.

Argentina thanked Brazil for “its “commitment and responsibility” and warned Venezuela that it “must respect the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.”

The developments at the Argentine embassy come hours after the country’s foreign ministry asked the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against Maduro and other senior government officials for possible crimes against humanity allegedly committed during post-election protests.

On Thursday, while speaking at a forum in Buenos Aires, Argentinian President Javier Milei called Maduro a “criminal.”

Argentina has rejected an arrest warrant issued by a Venezuelan court against Edmundo González, candidate of the opposition Democratic Unity Platform (PUD) and Maduro’s main rival, for his alleged responsibility in the publication of detailed data on the presidential elections.

González denies the charges. The PUD says it obtained those records through its election witnesses."
americas,"Brazil plane crash: Voepass aircraft’s icing detectors were activated, says early report",2024-09-06,Reuters,"Reuters and CNN —

A preliminary report into the August crash of an airliner in Brazil found signs of ice buildup on the plane but no definite cause for the accident, the country’s Center for Research and Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents (Cenipa) said on Friday.

The document pointed out that icing detectors had been activated on airline Voepass’ aircraft, and a Cenipa official told a press conference that cockpit recordings showed the copilot said there was “a lot of icing” during the flight.

According to investigators, that comment indicates that the plane’s de-icing system might have failed, but Cenipa said that information still needed to be confirmed.

Three experts interviewed by Reuters suggested that icing could have played a role in the crash, but urged caution as the report is preliminary and accidents are caused by multiple factors.

The ATR-72 aircraft from local carrier Voepass swirled out of control before plunging to the ground on Aug. 9, killing all 62 on board.

According to Cenipa, investigations into the crash will probably last for over a year.

US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse said: “Everything I have read from the report today is consistent with icing, but accidents are rarely caused by one single event.”

After looking at the report, aviation safety analyst David Soucie told CNN on Saturday that it appeared the crew may have “armed the de-ice boots (on the plane) too soon. Just a few seconds after the de-ice warning,” adding that ice must be allowed to build up on the leading edge of a plane’s wing so it will break off.

“If you don’t let it build first, as in this case, the ice simply builds up in the inflated boot. Then the inflation cycle is under the ice dome and does nothing,” he said, adding that it then gets “heavier and heavier.”

According to officials, loss of speed alerts were triggered, but the ATR’s crew never declared an emergency situation before the plane spiraled down to the ground.

Cenipa officials on Friday also said it is still unclear to them why an aircraft with all necessary certifications ended up losing control and falling. “What we know is that the airplane was flying in an area with severe icing conditions,” said lieutenant colonel Paulo Froes.

The carrier said in a statement that the report confirmed that the aircraft and the pilots were properly certified, adding that the ATR’s required systems were in operation. It added the company would continue cooperating with the investigations.

The turboprop, bound for Sao Paulo’s international airport, had taken off from Cascavel, in the state of Parana and crashed in the town of Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.

CNN has previously reported that numerous videos posted on social media show the turboprop ATR 72 in an apparent flat spin as it spiraled toward the ground with no visible forward movement in what became 2024’s deadliest crash of a commercial airliner.

In-flight icing can “distort the flow of air over the wing and adversely affect handling qualities,” according to Federal Aviation Administration documents, leading an airplane to “roll or pitch uncontrollably, and recovery may be impossible.”

This is a developing story and will be updated."
asia,Singaporean man ordered to repay tens of millions in debt to Australian casino,2024-09-10,Lex Harvey,"A Singaporean man has been ordered to repay more than 38 million Australian dollars ($25.7 million) after he lost big during a gambling spree at an Australian casino over the span of a few days.

Queensland’s Supreme Court ruled Monday that Yew Choy Wong owed that amount to the Star Gold Coast, as well as the casino’s legal fees and interest. He had racked up losses of 47.3 million Australian dollars ($31.5 million) there between July 26 and August 2, 2018.

Wong fled the country without settling his bill, according to court documents. The casino tried to recoup its losses using a blank check Wong had given its sister property, the Star Sydney, a year prior, but that check bounced after Wong told his bank not to pay out any checks from the Star, the ruling said.

The casino then tried to recover the debt in 2019 by suing Wong in Singapore, but that case was dismissed a year later because Singaporean law largely prohibits the recovery of gambling debts.

According to court documents from that case, Wong frequently played the card game baccarat at the Star’s casinos, during which he and his “entourage of some 28 people” were flown to Queensland by the casino and housed in its private salons.

In the more recent case, Wong argued he did not owe the Star any money because he had complained about the way the casino’s dealers had dealt cards to him, after which he stopped gambling.

Wong said he resumed gambling after the Star’s chief operating officer, Paul Arbuckle, verbally agreed that Wong would not have to pay for losses he had already incurred and that the casino would waive any further losses, if the dealers repeated their alleged mistakes.

Arbuckle denied making this agreement, according to the ruling.

Star Entertainment, which owns the Gold Coast casino, declined to comment on the case.

CNN has reached out to Wong’s representatives.

In a letter presented to the court, which was addressed to Wong and signed by Arbuckle, the COO apologized for “difficulties” Wong experienced during his visit, but noted the mistakes would have had no direct financial impact on Wong. The letter did not mention waiving Wong’s debt.

The casino also paid Wong hundreds of thousands of dollars in goodwill payments following his complaints, the ruling said.

Justice Melanie Hindman said: “The alleged agreement pleaded by Dr Wong is not evidenced by the letter of apology or otherwise supported by any other evidence adduced in the trial.”"

asia,"North Korea’s Kim Jong Un says country to increase number of nuclear weapons ‘exponentially,’ state media reports",2024-09-09,Unknown,"SEOUL (Reuters) – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the country is now implementing a nuclear force construction policy to increase the number of nuclear weapons “exponentially,” state media KCNA said on Tuesday.

In a speech on North Korea’s founding anniversary on Monday, Kim said the country must more thoroughly prepare its “nuclear capability and its readiness to use it properly at any given time in ensuring the security rights of the state,” said KCNA.

A strong military presence is needed to face “the various threats posed by the United States and its followers,” he added.

Kim also said North Korea is facing a “grave threat” from what it sees as a US-led nuclear-based military bloc in the region.

South Korea’s deputy defense minister for policy, Cho Chang-rae, and his US and Japanese counterparts on Tuesday condemned Pyongyang’s recent diversification of nuclear delivery systems, tests and launches of multiple ballistic missiles.

Meeting in Seoul, the three reaffirmed a commitment to strengthen trilateral cooperation to ensure peace in the region, including by deterring North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, according to a joint statement released by the US State Department.

They also agreed to hold a second trilateral military exercise known as Freedom Edge in the near term.

South Korea will also hold a defence ministerial meeting with the member states of the United Nations Command (UNC) on Tuesday.

The UNC is led by the commander of the US military stationed in South Korea.

Last month, Germany became the latest to join the UNC in South Korea that helps police the heavily fortified border with North Korea and has committed to defend the South in the event of a war.

North Korea has criticised the UNC as an “illegal war organisation” and Germany’s entry into the US-led UN border monitoring force as raising tensions."
asia,Apollo Carreon Quiboloy: Fugitive preacher wanted by FBI arrested in Philippines,2024-09-08,"Catherine Nicholls, Amarachi Orie, Kathleen Magramo","Filipino pastor Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, who is wanted by both the FBI and local law enforcement officers on sexual abuse and human trafficking charges, has been arrested weeks after a standoff with the police.

The arrest concludes a fraught showdown between the pastor’s supporters and police who had surrounded a compound in the country’s south where Quiboloy had holed up.

In posts on Facebook, the Philippines’ Interior Minister Benhur Abolos, confirmed that the preacher, who had been on the run for three years, “has been caught.”

National police arrested Quiboloy, a self-styled “appointed son of God” and founder of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ church (KOJC), along with four of his aides in the southern city of Davao after they surrendered, according to state-run Philippine News Agency (PNA).

At 1:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m. ET), the detainees were issued a 24-hour ultimatum to come out from the church’s sprawling 30-hectare (75 acre) compound. They surrendered four hours later, Philippine News Agency reported.

They have since been transported out of Davao by military aircraft and arrived at the national police headquarters in Manila on Sunday night, along with four of his aides, PNA reported.

“I thank him (Quiboloy) for the realization to face the law. I also thanked the KOJC members and supporters for their cooperation and I hope this is the start of healing,” Director of Police Regional Office 11, Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, PNA reported.

Police had been attempting to arrest the preacher and five of his alleged accomplices in a raid that began more than two weeks ago in Davao.

Nearly 2,000 officers surrounded the church compound where Quiboloy was believed to be hiding. His followers allegedly threw stones at officers and blocked a highway with burning tyres, Davao police said.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters on Monday it was a relief that Quiboloy had been arrested after a massive police and army operation and added the pastor was entitled to due process.

“Although he is a very prominent person… we will treat him like any other arrested person and will respect his rights. We will go through the process. The process will be transparent. Everyone who is involved will be accountable,” he said.

Quiboloy’s lawyer Israelito Torreon said the pastor “chose to surrender because he does not want the lawless violence to continue within the KOJC Compound,” state broadcaster PTV reported.

A 2021 US indictment accused the 74-year-old preacher and his alleged accomplices of running a sex trafficking ring that coerced girls and young women to have sex with him under threats of “eternal damnation” for nearly 15 years. Quiboloy has denied all the charges against him.

He is also accused of conducting a labor trafficking scheme that brought church members to the US using fraudulently obtained visas and forced the members to solicit donations for a bogus charity based in California, according to US prosecutors.

Quiboloy founded the Kingdom of Jesus Christ church in 1985 and rose to prominence as televangelism gained popularity in the Philippines, a majority-Catholic country where millions also follow a plethora of Christian sects.

The church, which claims to have seven million followers worldwide, runs businesses including a college, resort and media outlets in the Philippines, according to its official website.

Quiboloy is a close supporter and spiritual adviser of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, who regularly appeared on a church-linked media network when he was mayor of Davao, a testing ground for Duterte’s controversial war on drugs that rights groups say later resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings."
asia,Pope Francis flies to remote corner of Papua New Guinea as Asia trip pivots to marginalized communities,2024-09-07,Christopher Lamb,"Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea CNN —

Pope Francis emphasized the importance of a Catholic Church serving marginalized communities during his trip to Papua New Guinea over the weekend, flying in a military plane to one of the most remote parts of the Pacific nationas part of his lengthy Asia tour.

Speaking to church leaders in the capital, Port Moresby, he told them to focus on the “peripheries of this country” and those in the most deprived urban areas.

He insisted the church was committed to helping those who are wounded “morally and physically” due to “prejudice and superstition.” According to rights group Human Rights Watch, Papua New Guinea is one of the most dangerous places in the world for women or girls, due to high rates of sexual violence.

The 87-year-old is currently on the longest trip of his pontificate – a marathon 12-day visit of four countries in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, which also includes East Timor and Singapore.

Francis delivered his remarks at the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians church, where the Catholic community undertakes various charitable and educational works.

Beforehand he had visited the Caritas Technical Secondary School, a school for underprivileged girls, and those from the “street ministry” and “Callan services,” which work with the poorest and those with disabilities.

His decision to visit the school – which provides educational opportunities for girls – was significant given the discrimination and violence women suffer in Papua New Guinea. At the shrine, Francis also heard remarks from two women involved in church ministry.

The pope also spoke off-the-cuff during his talk, insisting twice that bishops and priests in Papua New Guinea follow the “style of God,” which is “closeness, tenderness and compassion.”

At the end, he greeted the crowd outside the church and, speaking in English, thanked them for their patience before offering them a blessing. He also joked with them to “pray for me, and not against me.”

Visit to remote corner of PNG

The following day a military airplane operated by the Royal Australian Air Force took Pope Francis to one of the most remote parts of Papua New Guinea.

CNN was among media able to travel from Port Moresby with Francis on a trip no pope has embarked on before – to Vanimo, the northwestern tip of the country, a place with no running water and little electricity.

The military plane – a C130 – carried some much-needed supplies including medicines, clothing, toys, and musical instruments for school children.

When the Argentine pope was elected, he told the crowd that the cardinals had chosen someone from the “ends of the Earth.” On his visit to Vanimo, more than 8,077 miles (13,000 kilometers) from Rome, the pope was putting his “ends of the Earth” style into action, showcasing the vision he has for a Catholic Church that goes out to the “peripheries.”

And Francis seemed happy and at home during his time in Vanimo.

An estimated crowd of 20,000 gathered on a grass field opposite Holy Cross Pro-Cathedral, music pumping out as they waited for the pontiff to arrive. They cheered when he made it onto the stage and cheered again when the pope promptly put on a feathered headdress given to him.

Out in the crowd, people had lined up plastic bottles of water, olive oil and salt so they could hold them up for the pope to bless. A number had travelled long distances by foot to be there with Vanimo largely inaccessible except by plane or boat.

After his meeting with local Catholics, the pope went to a school run by Argentine missionaries which helps orphaned children. Pope Francis was invited to Vanimo by one of the missionary priests and while there they served the pontiff mate, the Argentinian tea.

Sister Daisy Anne Lisania Augustine, who works for the bishops of Papua New Guinea and was in Vanimo for the visit, said the Catholic leader had seen a side of the country that is “mostly unheard of,” and that people in the area rarely get to see such an influential leader."
travel,European travelers will have to pay to enter the UK in 2025,2024-09-10,Tamara Hardingham-Gill,"European travelers visiting the UK without a visa will soon be required to pay a £10 (around $13) waiver fee.

The new rules, which will come into effect over the next year, will see the UK’s electronic travel authorization (ETA) system, first introduced for Qatar nationals, expanded to include travelers from all other countries, including European Union citizens.

The non-refundable fee will apply to all visitors to the UK, including babies and children, without a visa, or permission to live, work or study, according to plans announced by UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.

At present, citizens of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are required to apply for an ETA before entering the UK.

This will be extended to include most other nationals, including those from the US but excluding Europeans, in November. By next spring, the program will be expanded again to incorporate European nationals.

The rules will not apply to Irish citizens.

“Once fully rolled out, the ETA scheme will close the current gap in advance permissions and mean that for the first time, we will have a comprehensive understanding of those traveling to the UK,” Cooper said in a statement.

Jordanian nationals can no longer apply for an ETA to enter the UK, according to the UK government website.

Visa waiver schemes are certainly not a new thing. The United States’ electronic travel authorization ESTA, which now costs $21 and lasts two years, was first introduced back in 2009.

Meanwhile, the roll out of the European Union’s ETIAS, valid for three years, which will cost travelers 7 euros (about $7.50,) has been postponed to 2025.

travel,National Park calls out ‘world changing’ impact of dropped Cheetos bag,2024-09-09,Marnie Hunter,"Plain water is the only thing visitors are allowed to consume inside the huge cavern at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. Cheetos are a no-go, and the recent park visitor who dropped a bag full of them created a “huge impact” on the cave’s ecosystem, the park said Friday in a Facebook post.

“At the scale of human perspective, a spilled snack bag may seem trivial, but to the life of the cave it can be world changing,” the park said in its post about the garbage found off-trail in the Big Room.

“The processed corn, softened by the humidity of the cave, formed the perfect environment to host microbial life and fungi. Cave crickets, mites, spiders and flies soon organize into a temporary food web, dispersing the nutrients to the surrounding cave and formations. Molds spread higher up the nearby surfaces, fruit, die and stink. And the cycle continues.”

The park said rangers spent 20 minutes carefully removing molds and foreign debris from surfaces inside the cave, noting that while some members of the ecosystem that rose from the snacks were cave-dwellers “many of the microbial life and molds are not.”

The post called that particular impact on the cave “completely avoidable,” contrasting it with the hard-to-prevent fine trails of lint left by each visitor.

“Great or small we all leave an impact wherever we go. Let us all leave the world a better place than we found it,” the post urged park goers.

The park’s website says that eating and drinking anything other than plain water attracts animals into the cavern.

Carlsbad Caverns followed up its post about the Cheetos bag with a post about the “leave no trace” principle of disposing of waste properly.

“Contrary to popular belief, the cave is NOT a big trash can,” the post said, yet rangers pick up waste left behind every day.

“Sometimes this can be a gum wrapper or a tissue, other times it can unfortunately mean human waste, spit, or chewing tobacco.” Visitors are asked to make sure they don’t leave trash in the cavern and to use designated restrooms.

The Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns National Park is the largest single cave chamber by volume in North America. It is accessible via a relatively flat 1.25 mile (2 km) trail. The cavern was formed millions of years ago when sulfuric acid dissolved limestone, creating cave passages."
travel,Bali considering a ban on new hotels amid overtourism struggles,2024-09-10,Unknown,"Reuters —

Indonesia has agreed to set a moratorium on the construction of hotels, villas and nightclubs in some areas on the tourist resort island of Bali, as it grapples with the over-development of land, a senior ministry official said on September 9.

The moratorium is part of the government’s bid to reform tourism on Bali, one of Indonesia’s main attractions, to try to boost quality and jobs while preserving the island’s indigenous culture.

Hermin Esti, a senior official at the Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs, told Reuters the government had agreed to set the moratorium, although the exact timeline was still being discussed.

On Saturday, Bali’s interim governor Sang Made Mahendra Jaya said he suggested the moratorium in four of Bali’s busy areas to the central government, taking aim at over-development for commercial purposes, such as hotels, villas and beach clubs.

The governor’s office and Indonesia’s tourism ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.

The moratorium could stretch up to 10 years, senior minister Luhut Pandjaitan was quoted by news website Detik as saying on September 8.

Luhut has previously said about 200,000 foreigners now live in Bali, contributing to problems such as crime, over-development and competition for jobs.

Foreign arrivals in Bali have surged since it re-opened for tourism after the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos of misbehaving tourists often go viral, angering residents and sparking harsh responses from social media users in Indonesia.

Government figures show 2.9 million foreign visitors arrived through Bali airport in the first half of the year, making up 65% of total foreign arrivals in Indonesia by air.

There were 541 hotels in Bali last year, the figures show, up from 507 in 2019."
style,Meet the artist transforming tennis balls into furniture,2024-09-10,Leah Dolan,"In the last two years, tennis has taken over our closets (court-appropriate garb can be found everywhere from Skims to Miu Miu), our screens (who could forget Zendaya’s turn as the tennis protogé-turned-elite-coach Tashi Duncan in “Challengers”) and now — our living rooms.

At least that is the hope of Belgian eco-designer Mathilde Wittock, who fashions bespoke furniture from discarded tennis balls. Wittock’s sleek, modernist chaise longues are entirely cushionless — save for the padding of 500 precisely arranged tennis balls. Her one meter-long benches are similarly sparse, with some 270 balls being both stylish and structurally substantial.

“It takes around 24 different manufacturing steps to (make) a tennis ball, which is around five days. Then it has such a short lifespan,” Wittock told CNN in a video call from Brussels. “I was looking into tennis balls because I played tennis myself, so I know there is a lot of waste.”

Around 300 million tennis balls are produced each year — and almost all of them end up in landfills, taking over 400 years to decompose. The US Open, which ended at the weekend, goes through around 70,000 each year, with Wimbledon not far behind at 55,000. Wittock estimates the lifecycle of a ball stands at just nine games, depending on the level of tennis being played. “Even if they are contained in their box, if the box has been opened the gas inside the tennis balls will be released over time,” she said. “(Eventually) they will get flat and you’ll have to throw them away.”

It takes Wittock around three to four weeks to build a chair, which she sells for $2,900. Every ball is cut and dyed by hand, with colors picked out especially to fit the client’s space. It was through much trial and error that she was able to harness the shape of the ball while masking some of its all-too-easily recognized features. “I needed to find an assembly that changed the iconic appearance of the tennis balls,” she said. “It’s yellow and has these white lines. How do I distort that relationship?”

Wittock started to see the design possibilities of the sporting equipment when she was studying at Central Saint Martins art school in London. “I was really interested in eco-design and where I sourced my material,” she told CNN. “And I realized that it was always very complicated to follow the history of materials. You never know where they come from, or how they’ve been processed. I got really angry at that.”

Today, she receives all her materials via donations from tennis clubs. Collections began small — sometimes with just 10 tossed balls at a time — but quickly grew. Now, Wittock works with the Federation of Wallonia in Brussels, who have offered her their entire stock — around 100,000. How long will it last? “It’s enough for a few months,” she said. “If things get wild. Maybe nine months, because I have a rhythm of cutting tennis balls. I can get through 1,800 per week.”

Wittock cuts each tennis ball by hand, her and her team average around 1,800 per week. Mathilde Wittock

But creation isn’t the only goal. In fact, more important to Wittock is how her pieces are destroyed. “I’m an eco designer,” she said. “Eco design is about circularity. You can use great materials that are low carbon emission or recycled, but you need to think of the end cycle. If it’s not a circle, and if you can’t reuse (the elements) into something else, it’s not eco design. It’s even worse, because it’s new materials.” At the end of her furniture’s life, Wittock can de-assemble the hundreds of tennis balls (which are woven together without glue) to be recycled, where the fuzz is burnt off and the rubber shredded to make bouncy playground mats.

Her next challenge? Tapping into the tens of thousands of tennis clubs in North America. “I’ve got so many people interested in the US,” said Wittock. “I’m really thinking of coming over and starting recycling there.” So next time you watch a tournament, don’t lament the abandoned balls — their lifecycle might just be beginning."

style,Rare copy of US Constitution heads to auction in North Carolina,2024-09-09,Associated Press,"Asheville, N.C. AP —

Historical document appraiser and collector Seth Kaller spreads a broad sheet of paper across a desk. It’s in good enough condition that he can handle it, carefully, with clean, bare hands. There are just a few creases and tiny discolorations, even though it’s just a few weeks shy of 237 years old and has spent who knows how long inside a filing cabinet in North Carolina.

At the top of the first page are familiar words but in regular type instead of the sweeping Gothic script we’re used to seeing: “WE, the People …”

And the people will get a chance to bid for this copy of the US Constitution — the only of its type thought to be in private hands — at a sale by Brunk Auctions on Sept. 28 in Asheville, North Carolina.

The minimum bid for the auction of $1 million has already been made. There is no minimum price that must be reached.

This copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the proposed framework of the nation’s government in 1787 and sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government under the Articles of Confederation, requesting they send it to the states to be ratified by the people.

It’s one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the other seven are publicly owned.

Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states, essentially certifying them. They were sent to special ratifying conventions, where representatives, all white and male, wrangled for months before accepting the structure of the United States government that continues today.

“This is the point of connection between the government and the people. The Preamble — ‘we the people’ — this is the moment the government is asking the people to empower them,” auctioneer Andrew Brunk said.

What happened to the document up for auction between Thomson’s signature and 2022 isn’t known.

Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and he oversaw the state convention during his last year in office that ratified the Constitution.

The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old chairs and a dusty book case, before the old Johnston house was preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time like a book.

“I get calls every week from people who think they have a Declaration of Independence or a Gettysburg Address and most of the time it is just a replica, but every so often something important gets found,” said Kaller, who appraises, buys and sells historic documents.

“This is a whole other level of importance,” he added.

Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet printed front and back is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He acknowledged there will have to be compromise and that rights the states enjoyed will have to be given up for the nation’s long-term health.

“To secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each and yet provide for the interest and safety for all — individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest,” wrote the man who would become the first US president.

Brunk isn’t sure what the document might go for because there is so little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution like this sold was for $400 in 1891. In 2021, Sotheby’s of New York sold one of only 14 remaining copies of the Constitution printed for the Continental Congress and delegates to the Constitutional Convention for $43.2 million, a record for a book or document.

But that document was meant to be distributed to the Founding Fathers as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. The signed copy being sold later this month was one meant to be sent to leaders in every state so people all around the country could review and decide if that’s how they wanted to be governed, connecting the writers of the Constitution to the people in the states who would provide its power and legitimacy.

The auction listing doesn’t identify the seller, saying its part of a collection that is in private hands.

Other items up for auction in Asheville include a 1776 first draft of the Articles of Confederation and a 1788 Journal of the Convention of North Carolina at Hillsborough where representatives spent two weeks debating if ratifying the Constitution would put too much power with the nation instead of the states."
style,New York Fashion Week: Highlights from Spring-Summer 2025 runways,2024-09-09,Jacqui Palumbo,"Over the past few days in New York City — and a little further afield, on Long Island — mainstay brands like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger looked to reinvigorate the classics, while labels including Alaïa and Off-White, who typically show in Paris, crossed the pond to define what American fashion means to them.

New York Fashion Week, which formally kicks off fashion month, has found itself at a crossroads in recent seasons as its counterparts in Milan and Paris have maintained dominance on the industry’s schedule with sought-after shows and splashy celebrity guest lists. But that doesn’t mean the city has been without its A-listers — especially since the weeklong event has coincided with the U.S. Open, bringing out plenty of stars to sit both by the court and the catwalk.

Ralph Lauren got things started with an off-schedule Hamptons fête on Thursday, recreating its iconic Polo Bar for guests including First Lady Jill Biden, singer Usher, and actors Jude Law, Tom Hiddleston and Naomi Watts. At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum the following night, Alaïa reunited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Amber Valletta and Stephanie Seymour in the audience while Kendall Jenner led the models’ procession around the art museum’s famed spiraling architecture — though Rihanna’s glittering appearance in a crystal mesh ensemble by the French luxury house was the biggest surprise of the evening.

Off-White also had no shortage of famous faces on Sunday to see creative director Ib Kamara stage the label’s first-ever New York runway, drawing singers Zayn Malik, Mary J. Blige and Camila Cabello and model Alessandra Ambrosio, to waterfront basketball courts in Brooklyn. Also in attendance was US Olympic water poloist Ashleigh Johnson — with rapper Flavor Flav, of course, who became a sponsor of her team this year — and 2024 Olympic all-around gymnastics gold medalist Sunisa Lee.

But Olympians haven’t just been on the guest list this week — they’ve made surprise runway debuts as well. Another one of the gymnastics “Golden Girls,” Jordan Chiles, traded the balance beam for the catwalk at Kim Shui, wearing a floral silk leotard-style outfit, finished with a fluttering cape, while sprinter Noah Lyles took a more leisurely pace at Willy Chavarria’s show in white athletic shorts and armbands emblazoned with “América,” the name the designer chose for a show about the immigrant perspective of the American Dream.

Chavarria’s latest collection — which featured baggy, belted khakis; crisp ties and lapels; and utility menswear skirts, followed by a separate, new sportswear line with Adidas — was set against the backdrop of the American flag and began with a performance of the classic Spanish love song “Querida.” (Guests also received small booklets from the American Civil Liberties Union printed with the full US Constitution, a reminder of the country’s founding ideals.)

It was far from the only show that expressed a sense of political urgency ahead of the 2024 election. The surrealist label Area, celebrating its 10th anniversary, partnered with Tinder to promote (and donate to) the national abortion rights campaign Bans Off Our Bodies, showing a collection of handprints and fingerprints printed, stitched and etched on the garments.

“We really think about and reflect on what is going on in the world and put that back into our clothes,” Area creative director Piotrek Panszczyk told CNN backstage.

The Nepali American designer Prabal Gurung, too, had a message, but one of hope. Galvanized by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Gurung wrote in the show notes that he wanted “create a collection that reflects “a powerful affirmation of matriarchy, femininity and the future.” Gurung’s collection of trailing neck scarves, sheer bustiers and hand-draped sari pants was full of movement on a breezy day near City Hall — and included a seemingly tongue-in-cheek reference to Harris with an embroidered coconut tree mini dress.

“I’ve always believed in power of women, of feminine-leaning ideas,” Gurung told CNN just before the show. “I’ve always believed that they saved me… and I know they can save the world.”

style,Could a $1.4M portrait found in a Maine attic be a long-lost Rembrandt?,2024-09-08,Oscar Holland,"During a routine house call to a private estate in Camden, Maine, auctioneer Kaja Veilleux made an unexpected discovery in the property’s attic: A 17th-century painting of a young woman wearing a cap and ruffled collar.

“On house calls, we often go in blind, not knowing what we’ll find,” said Veilleux, the founder of Thomaston Place Auction Galleries, in a press release. “The home was filled with wonderful pieces, but it was in the attic, among stacks of art, that we found this remarkable portrait.”

The artwork appeared to have been painted in the style of Dutch master Rembrandt — and a label on the frame’s reverse claimed it was by him. The paper slip, which appears to have been issued by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, also suggested the painting was loaned to the museum in 1970.

Very little is known about the portrait, however, and it is not widely recognized by scholars as part of Rembrandt’s oeuvre. While the auction house told CNN it believes the label to be genuine, the Philadelphia Museum of Art was unable to confirm whether it had ever borrowed the portrait. (A museum spokesperson added, via email, that “generally… a slip or label doesn’t necessarily verify a work of art — certainly more work would be required.”)

Thomaston Place would not disclose whether it consulted a Rembrandt expert about the attribution, but it proceeded to list the painting with an estimate of just $10,000 to $15,000. The portrait was described in sale materials as “After Rembrandt,” terminology denoting that a painting is believed to be a copy of — or was modeled on — a known artist’s style, and is not an autograph work.

But not everyone, it seems, was so sure.

After an opening offer of $32,500, more than double the high estimate, bidding at an auction last Saturday soon skyrocketed into six figures. Almost a dozen potential suitors, some of whom joined via phone from Europe, participated in the sale, according to Thomaston Place. Three telephone bidders remained until $900,000, before the last two pushed the final sale price up to $1.41 million.

The auction house believes this to be the highest sum ever paid for an artwork at a Maine auction. And the figure suggests that several collectors (including the winning bidder, identified only as a “private European collector”) believe there is enough chance that it is a genuine Rembrandt to be worth the gamble.

Lost from the records

Rembrandt scholar Gary Schwartz said a potential buyer had earlier sought his opinion on the Maine portrait. He advised the unidentified collector (who was not the winning bidder) to “go for it,” he said. The art historian told CNN he believes there is an “extremely large” chance the portrait was painted by the Dutch master.

While Schwartz stressed it is impossible to properly judge the work without seeing it in person, he pointed to a strikingly similar Rembrandt portrait, also depicting a young woman in a white cap, at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.

“The resemblance … is so strong that I am amazed that people accept one and simply dismiss the other,” he said on a video call from his home in the Netherlands, adding that he is “not surprised that somebody paid (over) a million when it came up to auction.”

Schwartz also points out that the Maine artwork featured in a catalog of Rembrandt’s work as recently as 1969. Listed under the title “Portrait of a young girl,” the painting is described as belonging to a private collector in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Although the catalog’s author notes that the attribution to Rembrandt is “doubtful,” Schwartz believes its inclusion is significant — and that the painting was simply never researched, as it was in private hands and inaccessible to scholars.

“When paintings fall out of interest, they just disappear into dark space,” said Schwartz, who published a 2022 book arguing that another downgraded painting, “Rembrandt in a Red Beret,” is in fact a genuine self-portrait.

Art historian Volker Manuth, who authored publisher Taschen’s 2019 monograph “Rembrandt: The Complete Paintings,” told CNN he was also approached by a potential buyer of the Maine portrait. He had only encountered it as a “poor black-and-white reproduction” in the aforementioned 1969 catalog, adding via email that he has “more doubts about the attribution to Rembrandt than not” (though he, too, stressed that attributions “should not be given without a thorough investigation of the original painting”).

“The price paid… might indicate that somebody has hopes that the cleaning of the rather dirty painting might turn it into a portrait with the qualities attributed to Rembrandt,” added Manuth, who is an art history professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands. “This happens more and more often. I would not be surprised to (see) the painting back on the market soon as ‘Rembrandt.’”

The portrait, which was sold in late August, was painted on a cradled oak panel and was discovered mounted in a hand-carved gold Dutch frame. Thomaston Place Auction Gallerie

A matter of opinion

There is no single authority on questions of attribution, and the influential Rembrandt Research Project ceased operations in 2014 (having not, in Schwartz’s view, ever considered the Maine portrait). Over the past century, the number of paintings broadly accepted by scholars as genuine Rembrandts has fallen dramatically, with hundreds reattributed to followers or otherwise downgraded to “after Rembrandt” status.

But inclusion in a major catalog, or the backing of a big auction house, can increase a painting’s value manyfold. Take “The Adoration of the Kings,” which was valued at just $17,000 by Christie’s in 2021 but sold for almost $13.8 million last year after new research led Sotheby’s to declare it an authentic Rembrandt, not the work of an artist associated with him.

Schwartz suggested that, should the Maine portrait receive similar endorsement, it might be revalued at up to $5 million. Speaking to the New York Times, authentication expert Mark Winter meanwhile estimated a figure “in the area of $15 million.”

In either case, the painting may, one day, be worth significantly more than the amount paid at the Thomaston Place auction. Though this may only transpire if the portrait’s new owner invites scholars to inspect it.

“The great thing, really, would be to go to Vienna with this painting, hold it up there (next to the similar portrait and) have a discussion with a few experts,” Schwartz said, adding. “It (was painted) on panel, so you can date the panel, and very often you find that the wood is from the same slabs that have been used by other paintings form the Rembrandt workshop.”

“Nobody should express a definitive opinion without studying the object,” Schwartz said."
style,Pharrell’s Joopiter puts on sale of G-Dragon’s prized possessions,2024-09-08,"Mike Valerio, Stephy Chung","Seoul, South Korea CNN —

Near Seoul’s Gyeongbokgung Palace, a hotly anticipated auction is being brought to life by two global celebrities: American singer and Louis Vuitton men’s creative director, Pharrell Williams, and South Korea’s trailblazing K-pop star, G-Dragon.

The sale features dozens of items owned by G-Dragon – an avid collector of art, design and fashion – including works he created and customized himself.

Williams’ auction house, Joopiter, is hosting the online sale and an accompanying exhibition, at the Daelim Museum.

There’s a multicolor fur coat worn by G-Dragon on tour, a pair of sneakers he had embellished with Swarovski crystals, and portraits the 36-year-old rapper painted of Frida Kahlo and Salvador Dalí.

“His fanbase, and people who love what he does — they’re able to now get access to these things that were personal,” Williams tells CNN in the South Korean capital.

“I just like the idea that this guy has opened up his trove of things that were very close to him.”

G-Dragon — whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong — rose to fame in the noughties as the leader of K-pop megagroup Big Bang. With an eclectic sense of style, he became Chanel’s first Asian male global ambassador in 2016, and started his own fashion line, Peaceminusone.

Joopiter has collaborated with a slew of celebrities since Williams founded his “digital-first” auction house in 2022. But parting with treasured possessions isn’t always easy.

“Memories hold a lot of weight and possessions hold a lot of weight, and it’s not just because you possess them — but sometimes the weight of the memory possesses you,” says Williams.

“To see people go back and forth through that tug of war is always interesting.”

Often showcasing atypical auction items – from Chinese singer Jackson Wang’s fencing helmet to Williams’ own high school varsity jacket – Joopiter hopes to broaden traditional ideas of collecting, while enticing newer, younger buyers in the process.

“The traditional and institutional auction house, consumer and spaces could’ve been perceived as a bit stuffy,” Williams says of collecting habits in the 1990s, adding that the space has transformed from being a “narrow world” to one with broader tastes.

“Now that consumer (who participates in auctions) is much more curious about culture and subcultures.”

Speaking to CNN at the exhibition, Joopiter’s head of global sales Caitlin Donovan advises budding collectors to “collect what you love.”

“So, if what you love is sneakers, start at a lower, more affordable level, and start building,” she says. “The wrong attitude is going in and trying to become a collector.”

“I think it’s about amassing memories and things that make you happy, that you want to see on your walls and on your feet. That is how you build a really beautiful, special collection.”

She pointed to Joopiter’s inaugural auction — a sale of almost 50 items from Williams’ personal stash, that raked in over $5 million.

These items were all, Donovan added, “bought because they were a moment in time and that was why they had memories, not because they were something meant to be sold one day.”

The online auction “Nothing but a ‘G’ Thang: The Art & Archive of G-Dragon” runs until September 10."

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. The areas covered include the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.

The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as a “tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.”

Hurricanes are rated according to intensity of sustained winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage.

A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.

The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness:

• A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours.

• A hurricane warning indicates that sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours.

Predictions

April 4, 2024 - The Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project team predicts an “extremely active” Atlantic hurricane season. The team forecasts 23 named storms, including 11 hurricanes, five of which will be major hurricanes.

May 23, 2024 - The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts an 85% chance for an above-normal season, predicting that there is a 70% chance of having 17 to 25 named storms, of which eight to 13 could develop into hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes (Categories 3-5).

weather,Tropical Storm Francine nears hurricane strength as it approaches Gulf Coast. Louisianans are already closing the flood gates,2024-09-10,"Elizabeth Wolfe, Mary Gilbert, Robert Shackelford, Eric Zerkel","Tropical Storm Francine is expected to strengthen into a hurricane Tuesday as it charges toward Louisiana where some communities were evacuating and slamming closed their floodgates in anticipation of the storm’s likely landfall there on Wednesday.

Francine was about 420 miles from Morgan City, Louisiana, Tuesday morning and packing maximum sustained winds of 65 mph – just 9 mph short of being a hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Track the Storm: See the latest spaghetti models and other storm maps here.

The strong tropical storm was dousing parts of far South Texas with a few inches of flooding rain and gusty winds Tuesday morning, but started to pull away Tuesday and track northeast through the Gulf of Mexico where it will start to intensify once again after battling hostile conditions overnight.

Forecasters expect the storm to strengthen significantly in the record-warm Gulf of Mexico and become a hurricane as early as Tuesday evening and keep strengthening through Wednesday morning.

The storm’s projected path has also been nudging to the east, which could aid intensification by giving it more time over the water and also implicate more of the New Orleans area. Because of the eastward shift, coastal Mississippi and Alabama are were placed under tropical storm and storm surge watches and warnings.

The storm could encounter more hostile conditions that could limit its strength before landfall, but it will not change the overall impact: Flooding rainfall, powerful winds and potentially life-threatening storm surge threaten to flood roads and cause extensive damage to homes and widespread power outages.

The most severe impacts are likely to be felt in southern Louisiana around the time of landfall, but the storm will be felt long before that over a wider area of the Gulf Coast.

Rain and scattered thunderstorms will continue along parts of the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts until Francine’s rain bands arrive overnight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive as early as Wednesday morning.

Francine’s most significant threats

A storm’s winds may determine its official strength, but its the water that is most likely to kill. Francine is no different.

Francine will push several feet of the Gulf of Mexico onto normally dry areas across the western Gulf Coast in what’s called storm surge. Storm surge watches and warnings stretch along the coast from far northeastern Texas to the Mississippi-Alabama line. The storm surge threat here is the reason behind several evacuation orders across the Louisiana and Gulf coasts.

Water levels will begin to rise most severely as Francine nears a potential landfall along the central Louisiana coast, where surge levels could reach 10 feet above normal.

Heavy rain-caused flooding also presents a significant threat. Flood watches have been hoisted for parts of the Gulf Coast – some areas that are expected to get doused by Francine were soaked by a non-tropical system last week, so it will take less rain to cause flash flooding.

The outer rain bands of the storm could begin to impact the Gulf Coast Tuesday night, though the most torrential conditions will hold off until Wednesday morning.

The storm is expected to bring rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches from the coastline of northeast Mexico to southern Mississippi, and some places in southeast Louisiana could see as much as 12 inches.

The storm should weaken quickly as it moves onshore Wednesday, but rainfall is expected to drench parts of the lower and middle Mississippi River Valley through the rest of the week.

Evacuations ordered along the Gulf Coast

Louisiana’s governor to issue a statewide emergency declaration ahead of Francine’s arrival. Gov. Jeff Landry said Monday he has already asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prepare to assist.

Evacuation orders expanded along the state’s coast Tuesday.

Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were set to go into effect in parts of Lafourche Parish on Tuesday afternoon, according the parish government. Mandatory evacuations were also in place for Zone 1 in Terrebonne Parish, the parish government said.

Mandatory evacuations orders were issued Monday and expanded Tuesday to the entirety of Louisiana’s Cameron Parish, according to an official’s social media. Both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were ordered farther east in Jefferson Parish’s town of Grand Isle, which was decimated by the Category 4 storm Ida in 2021.

Some parishes, including St. Mary and Terrebonne, started to close off floodgates and distribute sand bags Monday. Terrebonne Parish also declared a state of emergency, according to a news release.

Schools are closed across several Louisiana parishes on Wednesday and Thursday, including Jefferson, Terrebonne and Orleans, which encompasses New Orleans.

weather,"Tropical Storm Francine forces evacuations along Gulf Coast, Louisiana under hurricane warning",2024-09-09,Mary Gilbert,"The first evacuations have been ordered along the Gulf Coast as Tropical Storm Francine gains strength ahead of an expected hurricane strike by midweek, and a hurricane warning has been posted for Louisiana in anticipation of Francine’s arrival.

The storm was churning in the record-warm western Gulf of Mexico after forming late Monday morning a few hundred miles away from the Mexico-Texas border. Its maximum sustained wind speeds moved from 50 mph in the late morning to 65 mphby Monday night– just 9 mph shy of becoming a hurricane.

Flooding rainfall, strong winds and dangerous storm surge are likely this week along the western Gulf Coast as Francine continues to strengthen. Tropical storm and hurricane watches have been issued in the region as a result.

Along with the hurricane warning in Louisiana, tropical storm warnings and watches have been posted along portions of the Louisiana and Texas coast and a storm surge warning has been issued from High Island, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

The hurricane center is now forecasting more significant strengthening in the next 36 hours, and the system could become a hurricane as early as Monday night and reach Category 2 ahead of its expected landfall Wednesday.

As of about 10 p.m. CT Monday, the center of the storm was 125 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, moving at about 5 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is expected to accelerate Tuesday.

Francine’s formation follows a rare quiet period in the Atlantic, with no named storms forming since Ernesto in mid-August, during what are typically some of the busiest weeks of hurricane season.

While the storm is zeroing in on a possible Louisiana landfall, it’s still too early to pinpoint exactly where it could cross into the state and how strong it will be at the time. The storm could strengthen quickly over very warm water – a symptom of a planet warming from fossil fuel pollution – that essentially acts as jet fuel for tropical storms. It could also end up stronger than currently forecast.

Louisiana officials are already bracing for impact from the storm’s dangerous flooding and storm surge. Gov. Jeff Landry issued a statewide declaration of emergency and has been in touch with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prepare resources, he said at a Monday news conference.

“We want the citizens of the state not to panic, but to be prepared,” he said. “These storms are storms we unfortunately have been susceptible to each and every year, and hurricane season is upon us.” He also encouraged residents to pay attention to warnings from local officials.

There is a possibility the expected hurricane will be a Category 2 at the time of landfall and officials are expecting 7 to 9 inches of rain over a 12-hour period, said Jacques Thibodeaux, director of the governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.

Mandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Louisiana’s Cameron Parish, according to an official’s social media. Both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were ordered farther east in Jefferson Parish’s town of Grand Isle. In Mississippi, voluntary evacuations also began in the city of Pass Christian.

Some parishes, including St. Mary and Terrebonne, started to close off floodgates and distribute sand bags Monday. Terrebonne Parish also declared a state of emergency, according to a news release.

Francine could become a hurricane by Tuesday night a few hundred miles east of the Texas coast and is expected to strengthen up until landfall on Wednesday evening.

Tropical storm-force winds could reach parts of far northeast Mexico and far southern Texas by Tuesday. Ahead of that, storm surge and rough surf could cause minor coastal flooding on the Mexico coast early this week.

The storm’s worst rain and wind will likely begin by Wednesday morning, but storm surge concerns will ramp up for the US as the system strengthens and as it nears landfall.

A storm surge watch was issued Monday for coastal areas of far eastern Texas through Louisiana and Mississippi. Parts of the central Louisiana coast could endure the worst storm surge, with levels potentially reaching up 10 feet above normal.

Heavy rain will also be a serious threat, particularly in coastal areas of northwest Mexico Monday. The system’s heavy rain could also begin in far southern Texas Monday before reaching more of the western Gulf Coast Tuesday.

Tropical downpours from the system will bring 4 to 8 inches of rain from far northeast Mexico to parts of the Texas coast and southern Louisiana this week. Totals could come close to a foot for areas stuck under persistent downpours. A more widespread 2 to 4 inches is likely across the region.

Texas will get most of its heavy rain early this week, but some of the most torrential conditions could hold off until late Tuesday night for Louisiana.

Tropical rainfall could lead to a “considerable” risk of flash flooding, according to the NHC.

A level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Wednesday for much of Louisiana and parts of southern Mississippi, according to the Weather Prediction Center.

CNN Weather

The system in the Gulf isn’t the only area of stormy weather that could cause tropical trouble.

Two other areas in the open Atlantic have a medium chance of developing in the next seven days, according to the NHC. Any possible tropical system from either is still days away from developing, so it’s far too early to speculate on where they could end up.

weather,Line Fire: Residents flee as California and Nevada wildfires grow and forecasters warn of record heat this week,2024-09-08,"Paradise Afshar, Cindy Von Quednow","Editor’s Note: For the latest, follow our coverage here.

CNN —

Raging wildfires in California and Nevada have led to mandatory evacuations of thousands of homes, as forecasters warn of record heat in the West for the next few days. There are 14 active wildfires currently burning across California – with one so intense, it’s created its own weather pattern. Here’s the latest:

• California’s Line Fire explodes in size: The wildfire has consumed 20,552 acres as of Sunday after igniting at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains on Thursday. The blaze has more than quadrupled in size since Saturday morning. Authorities urged residents in several areas to flee as the massive blaze shot bright red flames and thick, billowing plumes of smoke into the sky. More than 1,800 fire personnel are battling the wildfire, which was 3% contained as of Monday morning, according to Cal Fire. The blaze has injured three people, though authorities have not released any details about the extent of injuries.

Thunderstorm winds are causing “very erratic behavior” on the blaze and vegetation is “critically dry,” the agency said Sunday. Smoke continues to be an issue for firefighters and residents, and afternoon thunderstorms have the potential to cause new ignitions.

“Hot and dry conditions mixed with thunderstorms are expected to challenge firefighters for the next few days,” Cal Fire said.

The fire prompted a smoke advisory to be issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a result, the Rancho Cucamonga Fire District recommended residents stay indoors if possible, keep windows and doors closed and reduce outdoor activities.

A flash flood warning went into effect in Riverside and San Bernardino counties until Sunday evening, according to the National Weather Service office in San Diego.

The storms producing localized, heavy rainfall are occurring near the Line Fire. The warning means flash flooding is ongoing or expected and could cause considerable damage. Landslides are possible, especially in recently burn-scarred areas.

Doppler radar-indicated thunderstorms are producing heavy rain across the warned area at a rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour.

• Line Fire creates its own weather: As it burns through acres of land, it’s creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds. The clouds can create erratic winds that push the fire outward, spreading it farther and challenging firefighters. If it’s hot enough, the clouds can produce lightning and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.

• Thousands evacuated in California mountain communities: As the flames move dangerously close, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department announced mandatory evacuation orders for about 4,800 homes in the Running Springs and Arrowbear Lake areas. Hundreds more have been evacuated in the cities of Highland, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village and Angelus Oaks. “The Line Fire is very active and spreading in receptive fuels,” Cal Fire said. “There are currently 36,328 structures threatened, including single and multi-family homes, commercial buildings, and other minor structures.”

Firefighters have been successful in protecting homes from flames, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Brent Pascua told CNN on Sunday.

“Firefighters have been successful so far, even with the unpredictability of this fire, and we tend to keep it that way, we’re ready to stand and fight,” Pascua told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield.

He added because of the unpredictability of the fire, all areas of the blaze are of concern for firefighters. “We have to make sure we have crews on all sides of the fire ready to stand their ground,” Pascua said.

• Bridge Fire in Angeles National Forest: A fire has rapidly grown to 800 acres since igniting Sunday inside the Angeles National Forest, just north of the Los Angeles metro area. Several roads in the park have been closed, forest officials said in a Facebook post.

• Boyles Fire near Clearlake, California: Multiple structures are burning near Clearlake, California, about 100 miles west of Sacramento. At least 30 structures are involved and about 4,000 residents have been displaced by the growing 76-acre fire, which Cal Fire said is 10% contained.

• Emergency declared in California: Gov. Gavin Newsom has proclaimed a state of emergency in San Bernardino County due to the Line Fire. He has obtained a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure the availability of vital fire resources, he said in a statement.

• Emergency declared in Nevada: On Sunday, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo declared a state of emergency due to the blaze, he announced on X.

• Nevada wildfire destroys structures: The Davis Fire, a dangerous, wind-driven blaze south of Reno, has burned about 6,500 acres, damaged or destroyed 14 structures and remains 0% contained as of late Sunday evening. Truckee Meadows Fire and Rescue reported “Heavy aerial resources and multiple agencies working to stop this wind-driven wildfire.”

The fire has caused the evacuation of about 14,000 people in affected areas of Washoe County, and more than 6,000 residents are without power, the emergency declaration detailed.

“Gusty winds are forecasted throughout the week,” an update from the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest said, adding customers who are currently without power should be prepared for prolonged outages and those who still have power “should be prepared for potential additional de-energizations due to the dynamic nature of the fire.”

NV Energy said it cut power “to prevent further ignitions and protect first responders.” It also asked those who still have power and are near the fire to prepare for potential outages.

“Power has been restored to 12,500 customers, but 6,300 remain without power tonight into September 9th,” NV Energy said in a social media statement.

• Sweltering heat will add to the region’s misery: Excessive heat warnings and advisories are in effect for southern California, the Desert Southwest and the northern Great Basin. Temperatures in Southern California range from 95 to 105 degrees – about 10 to 20 degrees above average for the region. An air quality alert has also been issued “due to heat wave and elevated fine particle pollution levels due to wildfire smoke,” according to the National Weather Service.

Residents on edge as massive flames approach

The Line Fire has grown more than 14 times in size in just over 30 hours, from about 1,180 acres at 5 p.m. PT Friday to over 17,200 acres Saturday night.

As the wildfire tears through the San Bernardino County mountains, some residents have tried to stop the blaze from reaching their homes.

Highland resident Brian Gano told CNN affiliate KCAL News he was trying to hose down the flames with his wife and son.

“The flames were right up on us because the wind shifted,” said Gano. “I got a high-pressure line in my backyard.”

Another resident, Diya Hirpara, said she’s been stocking up on groceries in case she needs to evacuate.

“It was pretty scary,” Hirpara said. “We’re just kind of on the edge, just waiting.”

Larissa Gonzalez said she was standing on Highway 18 in Lake Arrowhead on Saturday when she captured a storm rolling through the Line Fire. “There was a lot of thunder and lightning coming out of that flare-up; the wind was picking up and driving the fire over that ridge,” Gonzalez told CNN. She watched the storm for about an hour while parked in front of the Rim of the World High School to see what direction it was heading and to determine if she needed to start getting ready to evacuate.

Visitors to the area were also affected by the smoke and flames.

Mark Weidhase told CNN on Sunday he and his girlfriend decided to head to the mountains to escape the heat while visiting from Canada. As they were leaving Big Bear and heading through Running Springs on Saturday, they found themselves near the Line Fire. Weidhase said they pulled off Highway 330 to get a good look at the massive wildfire after noticing it was closed and receiving notice of an evacuation order. “I love the mountains, but not when they’re on fire,” he said.

Multiple agencies, including Cal Fire, San Bernardino County Fire and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office, are working together to manage the fire. The American Red Cross has set up an evacuation shelter at a local church for residents seeking refuge from the fire.

California is seeing an active fire season. Wildfires have scorched over 838,000 acres throughout the state so far this year, compared to 255,144 acres by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.

Adding to the chaos, a pair of earthquakes struck Saturday near Ontario, California, within a half-hour of each other, jolting the already rattled region.

The first earthquake was recorded at 3.5 magnitude at 10 a.m. local time, and the next was recorded at 3.9 magnitude, according to data from US Geological Survey. It was felt by residents living as far away as Los Angeles.

asia,"Typhoon Yagi kills dozens in Vietnam, China, Philippines",2024-09-08,Story Reuters,"Reuters —

Typhoon Yagi, Asia’s most powerful storm this year, was downgraded to a tropical depression on Sunday, after wreaking havoc in northern Vietnam, China’s Hainan and the Philippines, claiming dozens of lives, according to preliminary reports.

Vietnam’s meteorological agency issued the downgrade on Sunday but cautioned about the ongoing risk of flooding and landslides as the storm, the strongest to hit the country in decades, moves westwards.

On Saturday, Yagi disrupted power supplies and telecommunications in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi, causing extensive flooding, felling thousands of trees and damaging homes.

The government said the storm has led to at least three deaths in Hanoi, a city of 8.5 million, with these figures being preliminary. Fourteen people have died in Vietnam so far, according to reports, including four from a landslide in the province of Hoa Binh, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Hanoi.

A 53-year-old motorcyclist was killed after a tree fell on him in the northern Hai Duong province, state media reported. At least one body was recovered from the sea near the coastal city of Halong, where a dozen people were missing at sea, with rescue operations expected to start on Sunday when conditions allow.

Yagi has claimed the lives of four people on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, according to the latest update from local authorities. The civil defense office in the Philippines, the first country Yagi hit after forming last week, raised the death toll there on Sunday to 20 from 16 and said 22 people remained missing.

Risk of flash floods

After it made landfall in Vietnam on Saturday afternoon, Yagi triggered waves as high as 4 meters (13 feet) in coastal provinces, leading to extended power and telecommunication outages that have complicated damage assessment, the government said.

The meteorological agency warned of continued “risk of flash floods near small rivers and streams, and landslides on steep slopes in many places in the northern mountainous areas” and the coastal province of Thanh Hoa.

Relative calm returned on Sunday morning to Hanoi, where authorities rushed to clean up streets from toppled trees scattered across the city center and other neighborhoods.

“The storm has devastated the city. Trees fell down on top of people’s houses, cars and people on the street,” said 57-year-old Hanoi resident Hoang Ngoc Nhien.

Hanoi’s Noi Bai international airport, the busiest in northern Vietnam, reopened on Sunday after closing on Saturday morning.

In Hainan, preliminary estimates suggested significant economic losses and widespread power outages, according to emergency response authorities cited by state-run Hainan Daily."

europe,Ukraine’s military is struggling with low morale and desertion,2024-09-08,"Ivana Kottasová, Kostya Gak","Pokrovsk, Sumy and Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —

Dima never puts out a cigarette until he smokes it right down to the filter, risking burning his fingers to squeeze out one more drag. He spent years on the Ukrainian front lines. He knows the price of a good smoke.

As a battalion commander, Dima was in charge of around 800 men who fought in some of the fiercest, bloodiest battles of the war – most recently near Pokrovsk, the strategic eastern town that is now on the brink of falling to Russia.

But with most of his troops now dead or severely injured, Dima decided he’d had enough. He quit and took another job with the military – in an office in Kyiv.

Standing outside that office, chain smoking and drinking sweet coffee, he told CNN he just couldn’t handle watching his men die anymore.

Two and half years of Russia’s grinding offensive have decimated many Ukrainian units. Reinforcements are few and far between, leaving some soldiers exhausted and demoralized. The situation is particularly dire among infantry units near Pokrovsk and elsewhere on the eastern front line, where Ukraine is struggling to stop Russia’s creeping advances.

CNN spoke to six commanders and officers who are or were until recently fighting or supervising units in the area. All six said desertion and insubordination are becoming a widespread problem, especially among newly recruited soldiers.

Four of the six, including Dima, have asked for their names to be changed or withheld due to the sensitive nature of the topic and because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

“Not all mobilized soldiers are leaving their positions, but the majority are. When new guys come here, they see how difficult it is. They see a lot of enemy drones, artillery and mortars,” one unit commander currently fighting in Pokrovsk told CNN. He also asked to remain anonymous.

“They go to the positions once and if they survive, they never return. They either leave their positions, refuse to go into battle, or try to find a way to leave the army,” he added.

Unlike those who volunteered earlier in the war, many of the new recruits didn’t have a choice in entering the conflict. They were called up after Ukraine’s new mobilization law came into force in the spring and can’t leave legally until after the government introduces demobilization, unless they get special permission to do so.

Yet the discipline problems clearly began way before this. Ukraine went through an extremely difficult patch during last winter and spring. Months of delay in getting US military assistance into the country led to a critical ammunition shortage and a major slump in morale.

Multiple soldiers told CNN at the time that they would often find themselves in a good position, with a clear view of the approaching enemy and no artillery rounds to fire. Some spoke of feeling guilty for not being able to provide adequate cover for their infantry units.

“The days are long, they live in a dugout, on duty around the clock and if they can’t shoot, the Russians have an advantage, they hear them advancing and they know that if they had fired it wouldn’t have happened,” said Andryi Horetskyi, a Ukrainian military officer whose unit is now fighting in Chasiv Yar, another eastern frontline hot spot.

Serhiy Tsehotskiy, an officer with the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, told CNN the unit tries to rotate soldiers in and out every three to four days. But drones, which have only increased in number over the course of the war, can make that too dangerous, forcing soldiers to stay put for longer. “The record is 20 days,” he said.

As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops started to give up. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. More than a million Ukrainians serve in the country’s defense and security forces, although this number includes everyone, including people working in offices far away from the front lines.

It’s a staggering and – most likely – incomplete number. Several commanders told CNN that many officers would not report desertion and unauthorized absences, hoping instead to convince troops to return voluntarily, without facing punishment.

This approach became so common that Ukraine changed the law to decriminalize desertion and absence without leave, if committed for the first time.

Horetskyi told CNN that this move made sense. “Threats will only make things worse. A smart commander will delay threats, or even avoid them,” he said.

Pokrovsk has become the epicenter of the fight for Ukraine’s east. Russian forces have been inching towards the city for months, but their advances have sped up in recent weeks as Ukrainian defenses begin to crumble.

‘Everything feels the same’

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear his goal is to gain control over the entirety of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and taking over Pokrovsk, an important military and supply hub, would be a major step towards that objective.

It sits on a key road that connects it to other military cities in the area and a railroad that links it with Dnipro. The last major coking coal mine still under Kyiv’s control is also just to the west of the city, supplying coke to make steel – an indispensable wartime resource.

Ukrainian soldiers in the area paint a grim picture of the situation. Kyiv’s forces are clearly outnumbered and outgunned, with some commanders estimating there are 10 Russian soldiers to each Ukrainian.

But they also appear to be struggling with problems of their own making.

An officer from a brigade fighting in Pokrovsk, who asked for their name to be withheld for security reasons, told CNN that poor communication between different units is a major issue there.

There have even been cases of troops not disclosing the full battlefield picture to other units out of fear it would make them look bad, the officer said.

One battalion commander in northern Donetsk said his flank was recently left exposed to Russian attacks after soldiers from neighboring units abandoned their positions without reporting it.

The high number of different units that Kyiv has sent to the eastern front lines has caused communication problems, according to several rank-and-file soldiers who were until recently fighting in Pokrovsk.

One said it was not unheard of to have Ukrainian signal jammers affecting vital coordination and drone launches because units from different brigades didn’t communicate properly.

A group of sappers – or combat engineers – spoke to CNN near the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Kursk region, where they have been recently redeployed from just south of Pokrovsk.

Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into Kursk last month, taking Moscow by surprise and quickly advancing some 30 kilometers (19 miles) into Russian territory.

Ukraine’s leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, said one of the goals of the operation was to prevent further attacks on northern Ukraine, while also showing Kyiv’s Western allies that, with the right support, the Ukrainian military can fight back and eventually win the war.

The operation also gave a major boost to an exhausted nation. Ukraine has been on the backfoot for most of the past year, enduring relentless attacks, blackouts and heartbreaking losses.

But the sappers were not too sure about the strategy. Having just finished a long mission over the border, they were slumped around a table outside a closed restaurant near the frontier, waiting for their car to turn up.

Chain smoking and trying to stay awake, they questioned why they were sent to Kursk when the eastern front line is in disarray.

“It felt weird entering Russia, because in this war we were supposed to defend our soil and our country, and now we’re fighting on the other country’s territory,” one of them said. CNN is not disclosing their identities because they were not authorized to speak to the media and due to the sensitive nature of their words.

All four have been fighting for more than two-and-half years and theirs is a tough job. As sappers, they spend days on the front lines, clearing mine fields, preparing defenses and conducting controlled explosions. They can find themselves under attack, ahead of even the first line of infantry, dragging around some 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of kit and four anti-tank mines, each weighing about 10 kilograms (22 pounds).

Speaking to CNN, they appeared completely exhausted. They had no rest between their Pokrovsk mission and the one in Kursk.

“It depends on each commander. Some units receive rotations and have time off, while others are just fighting non-stop, the whole system is not very fair,” one of the soldiers said. Asked if the advances in Kursk gave them the same boost as the rest of the nation, they remained skeptical.

“After three years of this, war, everything feels the same,” one of the men told CNN.

‘Rotten approach’

Speaking to CNN on Thursday, Ukraine’s Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted low morale is still an issue and said raising it was “a very important part” of his job.

“The Kursk operation… significantly improved the morale of not only the military but the entire Ukrainian population,” he said.

He said he had been going to the front lines regularly to meet with the soldiers there and do what he could to make them feel better. “We understand each other no matter who I am talking to, whether it is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander or a battalion commander… I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience. The front line is my life,” he said.

And Horetskyi – an officer specially trained to provide moral and psychological support to troops – is part of the plan to boost morale.

During recent leave in Kyiv, Horetskyi told CNN that while his role has existed for a while, it consisted mostly of paperwork. Now he spends a lot more time with his unit, checking in, making sure they are not burning out. Not that his help is always appreciated.

“They have this idea that I’m a shrink that will make them take thousands of tests and then tell them they are sick, so I try to break down the barriers,” he said, adding that little distractions can prevent a downward spiral.

In the monotony of war, any break from the routine can help, he said. This can include a wash in a real shower, a haircut or going for a swim in a lake. “It’s such a little thing, but it gets them out of the routine for half a day, it makes them happy, and they can return to their positions a bit more relaxed,” Horetskyi explained.

Even officers with many years of experience are finding the situation in the east difficult.

Some, like Dima, are transferring to posts away from the front lines. He said his decision to leave the battlefield was mostly down to disagreements with a new commander.

That, too, is increasingly common, several officers told CNN.

The ranks of Dima’s battalion grew thinner and thinner, until the unit disappeared.

They never received enough reinforcements, Dima says, something he blames squarely on the government and its reluctance to recruit more people.

The battalion suffered painful losses in the past year, fighting on multiple front lines before being sent to Pokrovsk without any rest. Dima saw so many of his men killed and wounded, he became numb.

Yet he told CNN he is determined to go back to the front lines, but will make one change first.

“I’ve now made the decision that I will stop getting attached to people emotionally. It’s a rotten approach, but it’s the most sensible one,” he said."

Dima never puts out a cigarette until he smokes it right down to the filter, risking burning his fingers to squeeze out one more drag. He spent years on the Ukrainian front lines. He knows the price of a good smoke.

As a battalion commander, Dima was in charge of around 800 men who fought in some of the fiercest, bloodiest battles of the war – most recently near Pokrovsk, the strategic eastern town that is now on the brink of falling to Russia.

europe,Full transcript of Amanpour’s exclusive interview with General Oleksandr Syrskyi,2024-09-08,Cnn Staff,"On Thursday 5 September, CNN’s Christiane Amanpour spoke with General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, in his first television interview in that role. It was conducted near the frontlines, at an undisclosed location for security reasons. What follows is a transcript of their full interview, lightly edited for clarity.

AMANPOUR: General Syrskyi, welcome to the program.

SYRSKYI: [In English] Thank you very much.

AMANPOUR: So it’s great to be able to talk to you. It’s the first time you’re doing an interview on television. And I want to know why you think there’s such an uptick in the war against this country right now. Russian ballistic missiles just in one week alone in Lviv killed, you know, nearly 10 people. In Poltava, more than 50 people. Strikes all across the country.

SYRSKYI: [In Ukrainian] I believe that Russia is trying to force us to give up and break our will to resist by hitting our civilian objects and damaging civilian infrastructure. By targeting our civilians in this way, they are trying to break our will to win.

AMANPOUR: I want to ask you about Kursk, because I know that you spend time there, near the frontlines. And I know that you and President Zelensky came up with this operation. Tell me from your words and your view, what was the strategic purpose of the Ukrainian operation into Russian Kursk?

SYRSKYI: First, the enemy, Russian troops, had previously intended to use the Kursk direction as a foothold for further operations against our troops. On May 10, they launched an offensive in the Kharkiv direction, and just a few days later they planned to strike and advance in the Sumy direction by using the Kursk direction and the territories of the Kursk region as a springboard for further actions against our state, against our armed forces there.

Having suffered losses in the Kharkiv sector, they literally got stuck in their offensive and actually moved to the defense in Vovchansk. They stopped in the area of Hlyboke, in the area of Lyptsi. And the troops that went on the offensive in the Kharkiv direction were no longer enough. Then they gradually began to redeploy those units that were located in the Kursk region, in the Sumy direction, to the Kharkiv direction.

Thus, the offensive in the Sumy direction did not take place. But they continued to consider this direction, this springboard for further actions of their own. In addition, they continued to shell our settlements daily, which caused us to suffer losses, primarily among the civilian population. This lasted until May, and in May there was a significant intensification. It was already clear then that this delay was temporary.

For us, this direction was always a threat. Therefore, in assessing our capabilities, we chose the weakest point in the enemy’s defense, in the enemy’s structure. And this direction was chosen. This reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that he could feel what we feel every day. And we created our own security zone in the Kursk region. In addition, we took a sufficient number of prisoners. We created an “exchange fund” in order to release our military personnel who are in captivity.

AMANPOUR: Some of your – for instance, your defense minister has said publicly that the reason was to divert Russian forces from other parts of the eastern front. But there are others on the eastern front, commanders, who say it hasn’t diverted enough forces, and there’s still a lot of pressure on your forces on the eastern front – that important logistical hub of Pokrovsk. So has it been strategically a success, and even tactically a success, what you’ve done in Kursk? And do you think you might lose Pokrovsk?

SYRSKYI: We are doing everything we can not to lose Pokrovsk. We are strengthening our defenses there. Over the past six days, the enemy has not advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. So our strategy is working. Of course, the enemy has concentrated the most trained of its units in the Pokrovsk sector. But we have deprived him of the ability to maneuver his units and the ability to redeploy his strengthening units from other areas.

So, in fact, it turns out that even though they did not move many troops from the Pokrovsk area except for one marine brigade, they are now unable to manoeuvre their reserves as they used to. And this weakening is actually felt in other areas. We note that the number of artillery attacks and the intensity of offensive actions have decreased. In fact, the Pokrovsk direction remains the most problematic for us. In other areas, the situation has become more stable. So I think this strategy was chosen correctly and it will bring us the desired result.

AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about the obvious imbalance, and that is, essentially Ukraine, while you’re fighting hard, you are outgunned by the Russians. They have much more air superiority, for instance, more drones, they have more missile capability, they have more artillery capability. How do you assess the difference between what you have and what they have? And how do you make up for that difference?

SYRSKYI: You are absolutely right, because the enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course – in personnel, tanks, and infantry fighting vehicles. But this also motivates us. We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures. And also to use technical superiority.

First of all, by focusing on high-tech weapons. These are primarily unmanned aerial systems for various purposes. You know that we have created the world’s first such kind of troops as the Unmanned Systems Forces. We have created a command, we have created units, we have created regiments, we have created battalions, which are now proving their effectiveness in various parts of the frontline. Our best unmanned systems units are concentrated in the Pokrovsk sector.

In addition, of course, we use maneuvers with force, reserves, and fire. Thanks to the actions of our government, the president of Ukraine, the minister of defense, we managed to reduce the difference between the ammunition used by us and the enemy. The proportion is actually one to two, one to two-and-a-half. A year ago, this figure was one to ten, one to six. We compensate for this difference with unmanned systems. We are constantly working on improving them, increasing their efficiency, improving the control system, ways and methods of usage. We are trying to maximize our technical superiority over the enemy to offset their superiority in terms of numbers.

AMANPOUR: You obviously have much, much less manpower than they do. The Russians have such a huge advantage of manpower over you. I think now they have something like more than half a million people under arms. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, they had a hundred thousand. It’s thought that they may have 700,000 by the end of this year. And you said when you took this job that one of the issues that you have to do is make sure you can replenish your ranks – draft, whatever it is, get more, more, more Ukrainians to fight. How is that going? Are you satisfied, or not?

SYRSKYI: In general, we manage to maintain our mobilisation capabilities at the appropriate level and ensure both replenishment of losses and training of new units. That is, thanks to the coordinated work of all state authorities, military bodies, primarily territorial recruitment centres, we maintain these performance levels and ensure the replenishment of our military units.

AMANPOUR: Yeah, but what quality? There appears to be – and certain, you know, commanders and frontline soldiers have told CNN – that there’s a bit of a morale problem in some parts of the frontline. That a lot of young conscripts, young trainees are being sent out there. The battle is very difficult for them. Some of them just, you know, leave the trenches and go home. And I just wondered, you know – again, you said, boosting morale is a very important part of your job. And I think there’s something like 19,000 cases that have been brought before the military authorities of desertion and the failure to turn up for duty. Talk about that. How can somebody like you boost morale and make people still want to fight? Because that – we feel, we hear, that that moment of patriotic fervour that was so obvious at the beginning of the invasion seems to be cooling down.

SYRSKYI: You are right on this point. The issue of morale is a very important area of our work. And, of course, we are talking about the Kursk operation again. This was a factor that significantly improved the morale of not only the military but the entire Ukrainian population. That is, it was and still is an incentive that has boosted the morale of our servicemen, their desire to win. This is first of all.

Secondly, regarding training: of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified, professional military personnel. At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible. That is why we usually conduct basic military training for at least a month, and qualified training from half a month to a month. Thus, our soldiers are trained for a month and more – up to two months. In the long term, we are considering increasing this period and this will give us certain advantages.

And now we focus primarily on the professionalism of our instructors, on building up our training and material base, our training centers, and using training schools where servicemen acquire advanced skills in mastering weapons and related equipment. This is also probably the main activity of the ground forces, airborne assault forces and other types of troops, which are aimed at training qualified specialists who take part in combat operations.

AMANPOUR: I want to know – I mean, you as commander, do you go to the frontlines? Do you go to the trenches? Do you talk to soldiers there, and commanders? What do they say to you? Because I know some of them have been there for, you know, more than two years. They barely get rotation, they don’t get to see their family, there are these glide bombs, these terrifying things, I mean, drones, there’s just so much. I mean, it’s almost, it’s almost World War I kind of, you know, attacks on them in the trenches. And they’re there for a long time, with no real hope of rotation. What do they say to you when you go to see them and talk to them?

SYRSKYI: We speak the same language. We understand each other no matter who I am talking to, whether it is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander or a battalion commander. You know that I have been in this war since 2014. Since the beginning of the full-scale aggression, I have actually been participating in combat operations as the commander of the operational and strategic group. Now I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That is, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience.

Despite the difficult situation, we continue to carry out rotations. We didn’t stop this process even when Avdiivka was happening – when there were, perhaps, more difficult times. The issue of rotations remains a priority for us. Of course, people get exhausted and need rest. That is why the units are either withdrawn to the rear for rest or sent to training centers, where they spend a month or a month-and-a-half recuperating. In this way, people restore their combat capabilities, their moral and mental state, and get the opportunity to visit their families and friends.

AMANPOUR: You became the overall commander at about the time that the US Congress finally approved, you know, the tranche of weapons and help that they’d promised you. It was a delay of six to seven months. What material difference did that make to your fight – the fact that these weapons were delayed for so long?

SYRSKYI: Of course, this has had a negative impact. When there is nothing to shoot with, no one and nothing to hold back the enemy, first of all, it leads to an increase in the level of losses, an increase in our losses not only in material resources, but also in human resources. Because the highest value in the Ukrainian army is the life of a soldier. It is very painful for us and of course it is painful to see that the losses of soldiers are increasing.

Well, the effectiveness of the use of troops is also extremely reduced, because when you have nothing to shoot with, you cannot hit the enemy efficiently and effectively. And this leads to the loss of territory. So how can this affect us? Of course, negatively.

AMANPOUR: And has it made a significant difference that the weapons have started to come now?

SYRSKYI: Of course, this has led to significant changes. But we would like to see these weapons arrive sooner. Because, unfortunately, this process is happening, but it is happening with a delay. This is also a negative for us. Especially when it comes to the formation of new units or when a unit is formed and there is no equipment, no weapons, how should we perceive it? You plan to use a mechanized brigade, but in fact you use it as an infantry brigade. As a result, its combat capabilities and effectiveness are much lower.

AMANPOUR: And obviously your ministers, your president are really appealing to the United States especially to stop restrictions on how you can use the weapons that do get here. What would you do with these weapons, if there were no restrictions on them? How would you use them?

SYRSKYI: We have repeatedly declared how we are going to use them. Of course, we will use weapons only against military targets, primarily against missile systems that strike populated areas almost daily. This leads to the loss of civilian lives. You know how many schools and hospitals have been destroyed in Ukraine, including Okhmatdyt, a well-known hospital. In fact, it was destroyed in the center of Kyiv by Russian cruise missile strikes. We have such cases every day. Not only adults but also children are killed. And the latest strikes on Poltava, Kharkiv, Sumy – in fact, there is not a single city in Ukraine that has not felt or suffered these losses. This horror of war, wherever you go, we have the results of these strikes, destroyed buildings, schools, and kindergartens.

So for us, first and foremost, it is a fight against the enemy’s missile weapons. Of course, it is the hitting of their warehouses, bases where weapons are stored, where fuel for the army is stored. Of course, this is all their logistics, which ensures the transfer of these weapons to the frontline.

Of course, these are the airfields from which the strike aircraft of the Russian army, their Aerospace Forces, use missile weapons, use their guided aircraft bombs with gliding modules, which they drop to 70 kilometres, even more. And again, they hit schools and populated areas. These are the targets. Of course, we will use [long-range weapons] against this [such targets]. We are not fighting against civilians, we are fighting against the Russian army.

AMANPOUR: You’ve been calling for a long time for fighter jets and F-16s to be able to not only take the fight to the targets, but also to intercept cruise missiles and others. There’s been an F-16 crash. Can you tell us what was the cause of that crash?

SYRSKYI: Firstly, I want to say that our pilots have been trained. They were trained in the educational institutions of our partner countries, and of course, the best pilots were selected who already had experience in effectively using the aircraft that are in service with the Ukrainian armed forces. Of course, they came highly trained, as our partners also confirmed, and received all the approvals to operate these aircraft.

Now a special commission of the Ministry of Defence is conducting an investigation to find out all the facts of the catastrophe, the crash of this aircraft. But before that, I want to say that the pilot who died, he shot down two missiles and he was just attacking, chasing the third cruise missile, using on-board weapons.

I think the results of the investigation will be known to everyone shortly. And on the one hand, we are not going to hide it, but on the other hand, the effectiveness of the use of these aircraft has been proven by the results – the destruction of four cruise missiles by a pair of F-16s, so this will certainly strengthen our defence capabilities, first of all in the fight against enemy cruise missiles.

AMANPOUR: There was word that it could be friendly fire. Do you think it was friendly fire?

SYRSKYI: You know, I can’t comment on something where there is no result yet.

AMANPOUR: Do you have restrictions on how you can use the F-16s that you have? And not many are in combat, right? I mean, one, two. How many are you using right now and do you have restrictions on them?

SYRSKYI: You know, I wouldn’t talk about quantity, I would talk about quality and how we use it. We use this modification of the F-16 as an interceptor and fighter aircraft. It is designed for this purpose and has the appropriate equipment and weapons. We, of course, train our pilots and they train every day, they are preparing to act against various types of enemy air attacks. Therefore, it is during these training sessions it’s been clarified this is its main purpose – to fight against enemy cruise missiles. And, of course, with enemy aircraft, if they can fly over the line of contact.

AMANPOUR: General Syrskyi, you were head of land forces during the initial part of the invasion in 2022. And you were created Hero of Ukraine by the president for successfully repelling the Russian attempt to take Kyiv and you lifted the siege. Do you think there was a moment then, in early April, where the dynamic – well, it did change, but could have changed? Was there a moment that, maybe a missed opportunity to really end this war then?

SYRSKYI: It is difficult to answer this question. It was an opportunity to push back the enemy, an opportunity to break the myth of the Russian army’s invincibility. Despite the fact that there were not many units in Kyiv and the bulk of these troops were consolidated units, these were units created from cadets, from training units, and training centers. It is precisely their competent and thoughtful use, the use of maneuver, the use of maximum artillery capabilities, tank fire capabilities, primarily maneuver and mobile operations, that have shown that even with small forces and the right tactics, victories can and do come, both small and more significant.

And most importantly, you should always look for the centre of gravity, i.e. the weakest point in the [enemy’s] defence. You may recall what one of the Georgian military theorists called the cascading destruction of the enemy’s defences. This is exactly what happened near Kyiv, and it also happened near Kharkiv, when, at what seemed to be the height of the enemy’s offensive, it was hit with a spot attack that caused its defences to crumble, which significantly affected the further course of the war.

AMANPOUR: And finally, after successfully pushing the Russians back from Kyiv, and then there was, you know, the success in Kharkiv, and success in Kherson – since then, it’s been much more difficult and you haven’t done as much as you perhaps were expected to do. What do you expect? How do you expect the war to go for Ukraine over the next six months, for instance?

SYRSKYI: It is difficult to predict for such a long period of time, but of course we plan combat operations, we plan campaigns, we make appropriate calculations of our capabilities, the capabilities of the armed forces, our needs. And of course, we are committed to victory. And the help of our partners, our allies, would help us a lot. It would help us a lot if all restrictions on the use of weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation against military targets – I repeat, not against the civilian population, against military targets – were lifted.

The planned deliveries of weapons and equipment would allow us to bring our new brigades, which have already been formed and are in the process of being formed, into service as soon as possible. Of course, this would have an impact on the overall level of our capabilities.

That’s how I see it. That is, only in the fight can we win. And we are all determined to win. And again, the Kursk operation showed that victory is the incentive that boosts the morale of our military and our entire population. That’s the only way to do it and no other way.

AMANPOUR: General Oleksandr Syrskyi, thank you so much for joining us.

SYRSKYI: I thank you as well, it was a very interesting conversation. Now, if we’re about to finish, then of course I would like to extend words of gratitude to all of our partners for the assistance, for the support, the political, the logistical, the material support that’s provided to us on a daily basis. We clearly understand that we’re not left alone, that only together we can be victorious, and I’m grateful to everyone, because together we’re stronger. [IN ENGLISH] Together we can win.

AMANPOUR: Together we can win. That’s really a good way to end. Thank you so much.

SYRSKYI: [In English] We have to win.

AMANPOUR: You have to win?

SYRSKYI: [In English] Yeah.

AMANPOUR: Thank you, General Syrskyi."
europe,Full transcript of Amanpour’s exclusive interview with General Oleksandr Syrskyi,2024-09-08,Cnn Staff,"On Thursday 5 September, CNN’s Christiane Amanpour spoke with General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, in his first television interview in that role. It was conducted near the frontlines, at an undisclosed location for security reasons. What follows is a transcript of their full interview, lightly edited for clarity.

AMANPOUR: General Syrskyi, welcome to the program.

SYRSKYI: [In English] Thank you very much.

AMANPOUR: So it’s great to be able to talk to you. It’s the first time you’re doing an interview on television. And I want to know why you think there’s such an uptick in the war against this country right now. Russian ballistic missiles just in one week alone in Lviv killed, you know, nearly 10 people. In Poltava, more than 50 people. Strikes all across the country.

SYRSKYI: [In Ukrainian] I believe that Russia is trying to force us to give up and break our will to resist by hitting our civilian objects and damaging civilian infrastructure. By targeting our civilians in this way, they are trying to break our will to win.

AMANPOUR: I want to ask you about Kursk, because I know that you spend time there, near the frontlines. And I know that you and President Zelensky came up with this operation. Tell me from your words and your view, what was the strategic purpose of the Ukrainian operation into Russian Kursk?

SYRSKYI: First, the enemy, Russian troops, had previously intended to use the Kursk direction as a foothold for further operations against our troops. On May 10, they launched an offensive in the Kharkiv direction, and just a few days later they planned to strike and advance in the Sumy direction by using the Kursk direction and the territories of the Kursk region as a springboard for further actions against our state, against our armed forces there.

Having suffered losses in the Kharkiv sector, they literally got stuck in their offensive and actually moved to the defense in Vovchansk. They stopped in the area of Hlyboke, in the area of Lyptsi. And the troops that went on the offensive in the Kharkiv direction were no longer enough. Then they gradually began to redeploy those units that were located in the Kursk region, in the Sumy direction, to the Kharkiv direction.

Thus, the offensive in the Sumy direction did not take place. But they continued to consider this direction, this springboard for further actions of their own. In addition, they continued to shell our settlements daily, which caused us to suffer losses, primarily among the civilian population. This lasted until May, and in May there was a significant intensification. It was already clear then that this delay was temporary.

For us, this direction was always a threat. Therefore, in assessing our capabilities, we chose the weakest point in the enemy’s defense, in the enemy’s structure. And this direction was chosen. This reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that he could feel what we feel every day. And we created our own security zone in the Kursk region. In addition, we took a sufficient number of prisoners. We created an “exchange fund” in order to release our military personnel who are in captivity.

AMANPOUR: Some of your – for instance, your defense minister has said publicly that the reason was to divert Russian forces from other parts of the eastern front. But there are others on the eastern front, commanders, who say it hasn’t diverted enough forces, and there’s still a lot of pressure on your forces on the eastern front – that important logistical hub of Pokrovsk. So has it been strategically a success, and even tactically a success, what you’ve done in Kursk? And do you think you might lose Pokrovsk?

SYRSKYI: We are doing everything we can not to lose Pokrovsk. We are strengthening our defenses there. Over the past six days, the enemy has not advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. So our strategy is working. Of course, the enemy has concentrated the most trained of its units in the Pokrovsk sector. But we have deprived him of the ability to maneuver his units and the ability to redeploy his strengthening units from other areas.

So, in fact, it turns out that even though they did not move many troops from the Pokrovsk area except for one marine brigade, they are now unable to manoeuvre their reserves as they used to. And this weakening is actually felt in other areas. We note that the number of artillery attacks and the intensity of offensive actions have decreased. In fact, the Pokrovsk direction remains the most problematic for us. In other areas, the situation has become more stable. So I think this strategy was chosen correctly and it will bring us the desired result.

AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about the obvious imbalance, and that is, essentially Ukraine, while you’re fighting hard, you are outgunned by the Russians. They have much more air superiority, for instance, more drones, they have more missile capability, they have more artillery capability. How do you assess the difference between what you have and what they have? And how do you make up for that difference?

SYRSKYI: You are absolutely right, because the enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course – in personnel, tanks, and infantry fighting vehicles. But this also motivates us. We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures. And also to use technical superiority.

First of all, by focusing on high-tech weapons. These are primarily unmanned aerial systems for various purposes. You know that we have created the world’s first such kind of troops as the Unmanned Systems Forces. We have created a command, we have created units, we have created regiments, we have created battalions, which are now proving their effectiveness in various parts of the frontline. Our best unmanned systems units are concentrated in the Pokrovsk sector.

In addition, of course, we use maneuvers with force, reserves, and fire. Thanks to the actions of our government, the president of Ukraine, the minister of defense, we managed to reduce the difference between the ammunition used by us and the enemy. The proportion is actually one to two, one to two-and-a-half. A year ago, this figure was one to ten, one to six. We compensate for this difference with unmanned systems. We are constantly working on improving them, increasing their efficiency, improving the control system, ways and methods of usage. We are trying to maximize our technical superiority over the enemy to offset their superiority in terms of numbers.

AMANPOUR: You obviously have much, much less manpower than they do. The Russians have such a huge advantage of manpower over you. I think now they have something like more than half a million people under arms. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, they had a hundred thousand. It’s thought that they may have 700,000 by the end of this year. And you said when you took this job that one of the issues that you have to do is make sure you can replenish your ranks – draft, whatever it is, get more, more, more Ukrainians to fight. How is that going? Are you satisfied, or not?

SYRSKYI: In general, we manage to maintain our mobilisation capabilities at the appropriate level and ensure both replenishment of losses and training of new units. That is, thanks to the coordinated work of all state authorities, military bodies, primarily territorial recruitment centres, we maintain these performance levels and ensure the replenishment of our military units.

AMANPOUR: Yeah, but what quality? There appears to be – and certain, you know, commanders and frontline soldiers have told CNN – that there’s a bit of a morale problem in some parts of the frontline. That a lot of young conscripts, young trainees are being sent out there. The battle is very difficult for them. Some of them just, you know, leave the trenches and go home. And I just wondered, you know – again, you said, boosting morale is a very important part of your job. And I think there’s something like 19,000 cases that have been brought before the military authorities of desertion and the failure to turn up for duty. Talk about that. How can somebody like you boost morale and make people still want to fight? Because that – we feel, we hear, that that moment of patriotic fervour that was so obvious at the beginning of the invasion seems to be cooling down.

SYRSKYI: You are right on this point. The issue of morale is a very important area of our work. And, of course, we are talking about the Kursk operation again. This was a factor that significantly improved the morale of not only the military but the entire Ukrainian population. That is, it was and still is an incentive that has boosted the morale of our servicemen, their desire to win. This is first of all.

Secondly, regarding training: of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified, professional military personnel. At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible. That is why we usually conduct basic military training for at least a month, and qualified training from half a month to a month. Thus, our soldiers are trained for a month and more – up to two months. In the long term, we are considering increasing this period and this will give us certain advantages.

And now we focus primarily on the professionalism of our instructors, on building up our training and material base, our training centers, and using training schools where servicemen acquire advanced skills in mastering weapons and related equipment. This is also probably the main activity of the ground forces, airborne assault forces and other types of troops, which are aimed at training qualified specialists who take part in combat operations.

AMANPOUR: I want to know – I mean, you as commander, do you go to the frontlines? Do you go to the trenches? Do you talk to soldiers there, and commanders? What do they say to you? Because I know some of them have been there for, you know, more than two years. They barely get rotation, they don’t get to see their family, there are these glide bombs, these terrifying things, I mean, drones, there’s just so much. I mean, it’s almost, it’s almost World War I kind of, you know, attacks on them in the trenches. And they’re there for a long time, with no real hope of rotation. What do they say to you when you go to see them and talk to them?

SYRSKYI: We speak the same language. We understand each other no matter who I am talking to, whether it is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander or a battalion commander. You know that I have been in this war since 2014. Since the beginning of the full-scale aggression, I have actually been participating in combat operations as the commander of the operational and strategic group. Now I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That is, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience.

Despite the difficult situation, we continue to carry out rotations. We didn’t stop this process even when Avdiivka was happening – when there were, perhaps, more difficult times. The issue of rotations remains a priority for us. Of course, people get exhausted and need rest. That is why the units are either withdrawn to the rear for rest or sent to training centers, where they spend a month or a month-and-a-half recuperating. In this way, people restore their combat capabilities, their moral and mental state, and get the opportunity to visit their families and friends.

AMANPOUR: You became the overall commander at about the time that the US Congress finally approved, you know, the tranche of weapons and help that they’d promised you. It was a delay of six to seven months. What material difference did that make to your fight – the fact that these weapons were delayed for so long?

SYRSKYI: Of course, this has had a negative impact. When there is nothing to shoot with, no one and nothing to hold back the enemy, first of all, it leads to an increase in the level of losses, an increase in our losses not only in material resources, but also in human resources. Because the highest value in the Ukrainian army is the life of a soldier. It is very painful for us and of course it is painful to see that the losses of soldiers are increasing.

Well, the effectiveness of the use of troops is also extremely reduced, because when you have nothing to shoot with, you cannot hit the enemy efficiently and effectively. And this leads to the loss of territory. So how can this affect us? Of course, negatively.

AMANPOUR: And has it made a significant difference that the weapons have started to come now?

SYRSKYI: Of course, this has led to significant changes. But we would like to see these weapons arrive sooner. Because, unfortunately, this process is happening, but it is happening with a delay. This is also a negative for us. Especially when it comes to the formation of new units or when a unit is formed and there is no equipment, no weapons, how should we perceive it? You plan to use a mechanized brigade, but in fact you use it as an infantry brigade. As a result, its combat capabilities and effectiveness are much lower.

AMANPOUR: And obviously your ministers, your president are really appealing to the United States especially to stop restrictions on how you can use the weapons that do get here. What would you do with these weapons, if there were no restrictions on them? How would you use them?

You know how many schools and hospitals have been destroyed in Ukraine, including Okhmatdyt, a well-known hospital. In fact, it was destroyed in the center of Kyiv by Russian cruise missile strikes.

And the latest strikes on Poltava, Kharkiv, Sumy – in fact, there is not a single city in Ukraine that has not felt or suffered these losses.

We are not fighting against civilians, we are fighting against the Russian army.

AMANPOUR: You’ve been calling for a long time for fighter jets and F-16s to be able to not only take the fight to the targets, but also to intercept cruise missiles and others. There’s been an F-16 crash. Can you tell us what was the cause of that crash?

asia,This 70-year-old med student just graduated. He has this advice for others,2024-09-07,Kathleen Magramo,"Hong Kong CNN —

Everyone thought he was the professor. But the gray-haired older man was a freshman medical student, just like the rest of the class.

“My family and friends were surprised at first. Several of my friends thought I was crazy wanting to study medicine at this age,” Toh Hong Keng, a retired Malaysian executive, said over a coffee in Hong Kong, where he has been living for decades.

This July, at 70, Toh became one of the world’s oldest students to graduate from medical school.

“It wasn’t always easy,” said the freshly minted medical graduate of the Southwestern University PHINMA in Cebu, Philippines. “At 65 to 70 years old, my memory, eyesight, hearing and body are not as good as when I was younger.”

Toh spent most of his life working in tech sales. But, for him, retirement didn’t bring long lunches and games of golf. Instead, each day for five years, he immersed himself in anatomy textbooks, aided by flashcards, reading glasses and large mugs of coffee.

Even for someone with multiple degrees, the material wasn’t easy. He was held back a year after failing a pediatrics exam in his third year. And in his final year, he was required to complete a one-year placement at private and public hospitals, with some shifts lasting a grueling 30 hours.

“Actually, why do I have to do this? Maybe I should give up,” Toh recalled saying to himself many times during those years.

Posing on a stretcher, Toh and his cohort completed medical school together. Toh Hong Keng/Henry Ahn Photo Studio

His family constantly checked on him, helping to dispel many waves of doubt. And his classmates, many decades younger than him, would remind him that giving up would be a waste.

But Toh said one word became his mantra, keeping him going.

“Sayang” — a phrase in the Tagalog language meaning it would be a shame not to see it through. “Sir Toh,” his classmates would affectionately tell him, “If you give up now, it will be sayang.”

During five years of intensive study, Toh never asked for any special consideration and had “a very strong resolve” to persevere, said Dr Marvi Dulnuan-Niog, dean of the medical school. “Mr Toh is already an accomplished businessman and professional, yet he is still very open to new things. He was very passionate and persevering.”

Too old?

Toh said he never had grand ambitions as a child to become a doctor. The idea came up when he met two young Indian medical students during a vacation in the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan in 2018.

That encounter over lunch sparked an idea that he might one day be able to pursue a medical degree.

“The only reason why I decided to study medicine was because I wanted something useful to do,” he said. “I’ve done different courses. I’ve done economics, I’ve done chemistry, I’ve done electronic engineering – but I don’t want to do that again.”

To Toh, medicine meant taking an entirely different direction.

“If I can’t be a practicing doctor, at least I can look after myself somewhat,” he said.

After signing off from his last day in the corporate world in 2019, Toh spent weeks studying for entrance exams and applied to nearly a dozen universities across Asia.

“If I can’t be a practicing doctor, at least I can look after myself somewhat” Toh Hong Keng

But he struggled to find a program without an age limit on applicants. Most were capped from 35 to 40.

Feeling a little dejected, he got in touch with his family’s former domestic worker whose daughter recently graduated from medical school in the Philippines.

After a few more exams and interviews, Toh eventually landed an offer at Southwestern University in Cebu. A week later, in 2019﻿ he packed his bags, found a small apartment on the island and started his medical school journey.

He completed his first year in Cebu, which included a course with clinical labs and hands-on learning. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, he moved backed to Hong Kong and took all of his lectures online.

The average age of first-year medical students in the United States is 24, and most students are 28 years old when they graduate, according to data from the American Medical Association. It can take at least 10 years more to become a fully licensed and practicing physician with residency experience.

Dr Atomic Leow Chuan Tse obtained his medical degree in 2015 from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania when he was 66, according to Singapore’s Book of Records. The following year, he passed a licensing exam which allows him to practice medicine in Europe.

While its unclear whether Toh is the oldest person to ever complete a medical degree, there are many examples of doctors still practicing well into their later years.

That includes Dr Howard Tucker of Cleveland, Ohio, who was born on 10 July 1922. He was recognized in 2021 by Guinness World Records as the oldest practicing doctor. Dr. Tucker just celebrated his 102 birthday and is still teaching neurology.

‘A better life’

A self-described provincial kid, Toh grew up on his family’s rubber plantation in Malaysia. As a teen, he and his siblings would wake up at 4 a.m. to tap rubber from the trees before heading to school.

“In those days we didn’t have much idea about what our dreams are. We just hoped that we can have a better life.”

He worked hard on the farm and even harder on his studies, which landed him an offer to study chemistry and control engineering at the University of Bradford in Britain between 1974 and 1978. He supported himself working part time as a waiter, mainly taking shifts during summer breaks.

He moved to London to do a master’s degree. To cover his student loans, he worked as a garbage collector alongside his studies. He didn’t mind the stench or grueling hours, as Toh said: “It paid good money.”

Armed with an unshakeable work ethic, he had no problems landing a job back home in Malaysia and jetting around Asia on different stints before settling in Hong Kong, where he and his wife raised three children.

“If you have a dream to be a medical doctor, you can still do it at any age.” Toh Hong Keng

But even after five years of intense study, Toh is not convinced he’ll take the extra steps needed to become a practicing doctor. That would require a year-long internship and more study for a medical board exam.

Instead, he plans to work as a consultant for a friend’s company dealing with allergy and immunology diagnostics in Hong Kong.

Toh’s years of study may be over, but they’ve inspired another challenge — to create a scholarship fund for medical students who struggle to pay for degrees as foreign students.

According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the average tuition fee per year costs around $60,000 for in-state students at public medical schools and $95,000 for out-of-state students in the US. Private medical schools have an average tuition and fees cost upwards of $70,000. As for international students, the figures are much higher.

Tuition fees were nowhere as high in the Philippines. It cost about $4,000 to 5,000 per year at Southwestern University for Toh, which he said was still very expensive for prospective students from developing countries across Asia.

But for anyone with enough energy to follow Toh’s path, he has this advice: “If you have a dream to be a medical doctor, you can still do it at any age.”

“Studying medicine is intensive and extensive, but it’s not that hard, it’s just hard work.”"

Everyone thought he was the professor. But the gray-haired older man was a freshman medical student, just like the rest of the class.

“My family and friends were surprised at first. Several of my friends thought I was crazy wanting to study medicine at this age,” Toh Hong Keng, a retired Malaysian executive, said over a coffee in Hong Kong, where he has been living for decades.

This July, at 70, Toh became one of the world’s oldest students to graduate from medical school.

“It wasn’t always easy,” said the freshly minted medical graduate of the Southwestern University PHINMA in Cebu, Philippines. “At 65 to 70 years old, my memory, eyesight, hearing and body are not as good as when I was younger.”

Toh spent most of his life working in tech sales. But, for him, retirement didn’t bring long lunches and games of golf. Instead, each day for five years, he immersed himself in anatomy textbooks, aided by flashcards, reading glasses and large mugs of coffee.

Even for someone with multiple degrees, the material wasn’t easy. He was held back a year after failing a pediatrics exam in his third year. And in his final year, he was required to complete a one-year placement at private and public hospitals, with some shifts lasting a grueling 30 hours.

“Actually, why do I have to do this? Maybe I should give up,” Toh recalled saying to himself many times during those years.

His family constantly checked on him, helping to dispel many waves of doubt. And his classmates, many decades younger than him, would remind him that giving up would be a waste.

But Toh said one word became his mantra, keeping him going.

“Sayang” — a phrase in the Tagalog language meaning it would be a shame not to see it through. “Sir Toh,” his classmates would affectionately tell him, “If you give up now, it will be sayang.”

During five years of intensive study, Toh never asked for any special consideration and had “a very strong resolve” to persevere, said Dr Marvi Dulnuan-Niog, dean of the medical school. “Mr Toh is already an accomplished businessman and professional, yet he is still very open to new things. He was very passionate and persevering.”

Too old?

Toh said he never had grand ambitions as a child to become a doctor. The idea came up when he met two young Indian medical students during a vacation in the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan in 2018.

That encounter over lunch sparked an idea that he might one day be able to pursue a medical degree.

“The only reason why I decided to study medicine was because I wanted something useful to do,” he said. “I’ve done different courses. I’ve done economics, I’ve done chemistry, I’ve done electronic engineering – but I don’t want to do that again.”

To Toh, medicine meant taking an entirely different direction.

“If I can’t be a practicing doctor, at least I can look after myself somewhat,” he said.

After signing off from his last day in the corporate world in 2019, Toh spent weeks studying for entrance exams and applied to nearly a dozen universities across Asia.

But he struggled to find a program without an age limit on applicants. Most were capped from 35 to 40.

europe,Dragon drones: Ukraine’s thermite innovation rains molten metal on Russian positions,2024-09-07,Brad Lendon,"Ukraine appears to be calling on a fleet of fire-spewing “dragon drones” in its war with Russian invaders, putting a modern twist on a munition used to horrific effect in both world wars.

A series of videos posted on social media, including on Telegram from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry on Wednesday, show the low-flying drones dropping torrents of fire – actually molten metal – onto Russian-held positions in tree lines.

The white-hot mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide, called thermite, burns at temperatures up to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 degrees Celsius). It can quickly burn off trees and vegetation giving cover to Russian troops, if not killing or disabling the troops outright.

As it falls from the drone, the thermite resembles the fire coming from the mouth of the mythical dragon, giving the drones their nickname.

“Strike Drones are our wings of vengeance, bringing fire straight from the sky!” a social media post from Ukraine’s 60th Mechanized Brigade said.

“They become a real threat to the enemy, burning his positions with an accuracy that no other weapon can achieve,” the post continued.

“When our ‘Vidar’ works – the Russian woman will never sleep,” it added. Vidar is the Norse god of vengeance.

Creating that kind of fear is likely the main effect of Ukraine’s thermite drones, according to Nicholas Drummond, a defense industry analyst specializing in land warfare and a former British Army officer.

“It is very nasty stuff. Using a drone to deliver it is quite innovative. But used in that way its effect will have been psychological more than physical,” Drummond told CNN.

“I understand that Ukraine only possesses a limited capacity to deliver a thermite effect, so this is a niche capability rather than new mainstream weapon,” he said.

But he acknowledges the terror thermite can create.

“I would not have liked to have been on the receiving end,” Drummond said.

Incendiary weapons in war

Thermite can easily burn through almost anything, including metal, so there’s little protection from it.

It was discovered by a German chemist is the 1890s and was originally used to weld railroad tracks.

But its military potency soon became apparent, with the Germans dropping it from zeppelins as bombs over Britain in World War I, according to a history from McGill University in Montreal.

Both Germany and the Allies used thermite aerial bombs in World War II, and they also utilized it to disable captured artillery pieces, putting thermite into the breech and melting the weapon shut from the inside.

According to Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a British anti-war advocacy group, Ukraine has previously used thermite dropped from drones to permanently disable Russian tanks.

The thermite is dropped “directly through the hatches, where the intense heat quickly ignites and destroys everything inside,” an AOAV report says.

“This precision, combined with the drone’s ability to bypass traditional defenses, makes thermite bombs a highly effective tool in modern warfare,” it says.

Thermite is just one type of incendiary weapon, with others including napalm and white phosphorus.

The United Nations Office for Disarmament says incendiary weapons can cause massive destruction and environmental damage.

“The fires produced by the weapon itself or ignited by it are difficult to predict and to contain. Therefore, incendiary weapons are often described as ‘area weapons’ due to their impact over a broad area,” it says on its website.

The United States used napalm to burn much of Japan’s capital to the ground in World War II’s infamous Tokyo fire raids. US forces also used it extensively in Vietnam.

The US military has also used thermite in grenades, with the US Army’s Pine Bluff Arsenal producing the weapons from the 1960s through 2014 and then resuming production again in 2023.

What thermite does to humans

Under international law, thermite is not banned for military combat, but its use on civilian targets is prohibited because of the horrible effects it can have on the human body.

In a 2022 report on incendiary weapons, such as thermite, Human Rights Watch called them “notorious for their horrific human cost,” including inflicting fourth- or fifth-degree burns.

“They can cause damage to muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and even bones,” HRW said.

Treatment can last months and require daily attention. If victims survive, they are left with physical and psychological scars, HRW said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow’s initial push into Ukraine was stopped far short of capturing the capital of Kyiv, and the sides have fought over much of the same territory for most of the war.

Ukraine’s forces, outnumbered and outgunned by Russia, have proven adept at innovating with small drones to hammer Moscow’s troops and equipment.

A Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory near Kursk in August surprised Putin and has boosted Ukrainian confidence that it can prevail in the war.

Kyiv has accused Russian forces of using unspecified incendiary munitions on civilian targets earlier in the war, including on a village outside of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in May 2022.

CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh went through that village, Cherkaski Tyshky, shortly after a Russian attack and described a scene of “homes, fields, even the air itself, torched.”

Ukrainian officers also accused Russia of using incendiaries in attacks on the city of Bakhmut last year.

Those uses of incendiaries haven’t led to quick victory for Russia, and Drummond doesn’t think they are a battlefield game changer for Ukraine either.

“If Ukraine wants to achieve real impact, it needs sufficient mass to force a proper breakthrough as it has in Kursk. This is what victory looks like,” Drummond said.

But thermite does give Russian troops another reason to be fearful of Ukrainian drones, he said.

“We have seen instances where Russian forces attacked by multiple drones have deserted their positions. The more Ukraine can instill a fear of drones the better its chances of success,” he said.

“Thermite keeps up the pressure.”"

europe,Massive train disruptions leave hundreds stranded in Germany,2024-09-07,Radina Gigova,"Massive train disruptions in Germany left hundreds of passengers stranded on Saturday, as authorities worked to restore traffic following a technical malfunction. Some traffic has since resumed.

Train services in central Germany have been “massively affected” due to a technical fault, the German rail company Deutsche Bahn said.

There were widespread train cancellations in the greater Frankfurt area due to a radio communications failure, public broadcaster ARD’s news service Tagesschau reported.

Trains traveling to or departing from Frankfurt were affected, and traffic through the major travel and financial hub was halted, according to Tagesschau.

Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Frankfurt’s Central Station on Saturday, without knowing when they could resume their journeys, Tagesschau reported.

One of the biggest transport associations in Germany, the Rhine/Main Regional Transport Association, or RMV, said in a post on social media on Saturday that due to a technical fault in radio communications, “train services in the RMV area have been suspended until further notice” and that neither S-Bahn trains nor regional trains could run.

“The duration of the disruption cannot currently be foreseen,” RMV said at the time.

It remains unclear what caused the technical fault.

Later on Saturday, Deutsche Bahn said the technical problem had been resolved. “Rail traffic in central Germany is starting up again. There may be disruptions until the end of the day,” it said.

Frankfurt is one of the most important European transport hubs with around 1,200 local and long-distance trains in regular service every day, according to Tagesschau."

style,The world’s most remarkable tennis courts,2024-09-06,Yahya Salem,"To the untrained eye, a tennis court is merely an amalgamation of nine parallel and perpendicular lines, converging to define the limitations of movement for both ball and player. But to American photographer and journalist Nick Pachelli, a tennis court is the harmonious union of surface, sound, and spectators, complemented by the natural elements and the inherent intensity of tennis.

“Tennis is our only sport where the canvas on which we play can change so dramatically,” Pachelli, a former top junior tennis player himself, told CNN, highlighting each court’s “unique persona,” as he describes in his new photobook, The Tennis Court.

During more than 500 days of travel, Pachelli visited over a thousand courts (of the roughly 200 in the book), crisscrossing more than 250 cities and towns in his pursuit of spotlighting the world’s most aesthetic, esteemed, and even idiosyncratic tennis courts.

Reached by a few hundred steps, the tennis court at Hotel Il San Pietro Di Positano in Italy is between the cliff face and the pebble beach. Nick Pachelli

From cliffside clay courts pocketed between the peaks of the Swiss Alps, to the salsa capital of the world that is Cali, Colombia and the vibrant purple and green hardcourts of Yangpyeong, South Korea where the background noise isn’t the cheers and gasps of crowds, but a DJ creating a partylike atmosphere.

The result was not only an anthology of captivating, vivid visuals and evocative essays, but also, essentially, a love letter to the sport and an homage to its patrons and communities.

“The book constantly asked this question of, what do we think about when we think about tennis?” said Pachelli, “We take that question as the spectator, the newcomer to the game, the die-hard player, the professional, the groundskeeper; every single role you could think of around this sport.”

Pachelli’s inclusive approach challenges historical preconceptions of elitism and inaccessibility which have long blemished tennis. In Pachelli’s view, tennis institutions must reckon with this convoluted history in order to advance the sport and elevate its global community. Pachelli gives the example of Lawn Tennis Clube da Foz in Porto, Portugal and the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Maryland as bastions of preserving tennis’ prestige while simultaneously uplifting their local communities through initiatives such as waiving fees for low-income youths, empowering female coaches and curating programs for disabled players.

The expansiveness of Pachelli’s journey is also a reflection of tennis’ surging popularity. In 2023, the ATP (the worldwide top-tier tennis tour for men organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (the principal organizing body of women’s professional tennis) tours recorded more than 1.84 billion in combined global audiences, while the United States Tennis Association marked four consecutive years of participation growth with nearly 24 million Americans playing the sport. Pachelli partially credits local grassroot initiatives with this surge, and also notes Hollywood’s recent investment in tennis with films such as King Richard and Challengers.

“There’s so much exciting grassroots tennis happening,” said Pachelli, “There are young tennis communities emerging that are finding their own tennis sensibility.”

Tennis is surging in popularity, particularly in the United States. The Courts at Borrego Springs in California describe themselves as 'four tennis courts, a clubhouse and a pool in the middle of nowhere."" Nick Pachelli

Yet despite his extensive travels, Pachelli still finds his peace cushioned between the seats of Grandstand and Court 17 in Flushing Meadows, New York, watching US Open games with some friends and some food, to a serene sunset backdrop.

“There’s no energy like the US Open. It’s wild and congested and a little drunk,” Pachelli said. “There’s no other place in the world like the US Open to experience every type of viewing of professional tennis.”

“I hope that sort of global tennis community interconnectedness is what will hopefully inspire some people to go experience it in new places,” said Pachelli, “because I think that’s the ultimate way to learn about yourself, see the world, and engage with your fellow tennis obsessives somewhere else.”"

Pachelli’s inclusive approach challenges historical preconceptions of elitism and inaccessibility which have long blemished tennis. In Pachelli’s view, tennis institutions must reckon with this convoluted history in order to advance the sport and elevate its global community. Pachelli gives the example of Lawn Tennis Clube da Foz in Porto, Portugal and the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Maryland as bastions of preserving tennis’ prestige while simultaneously uplifting their local communities through initiatives such as waiving fees for low-income youths, empowering female coaches and curating programs for disabled players.

The expansiveness of Pachelli’s journey is also a reflection of tennis’ surging popularity. In 2023, the ATP (the worldwide top-tier tennis tour for men organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (the principal organizing body of women’s professional tennis) tours recorded more than 1.84 billion in combined global audiences, while the United States Tennis Association marked four consecutive years of participation growth with nearly 24 million Americans playing the sport. Pachelli partially credits local grassroot initiatives with this surge, and also notes Hollywood’s recent investment in tennis with films such as King Richard and Challengers.

“There’s so much exciting grassroots tennis happening,” said Pachelli, “There are young tennis communities emerging that are finding their own tennis sensibility.”

Tennis is surging in popularity, particularly in the United States. The Courts at Borrego Springs in California describe themselves as 'four tennis courts, a clubhouse and a pool in the middle of nowhere."" Nick Pachelli

Yet despite his extensive travels, Pachelli still finds his peace cushioned between the seats of Grandstand and Court 17 in Flushing Meadows, New York, watching US Open games with some friends and some food, to a serene sunset backdrop.

“There’s no energy like the US Open. It’s wild and congested and a little drunk,” Pachelli said. “There’s no other place in the world like the US Open to experience every type of viewing of professional tennis.”

“I hope that sort of global tennis community interconnectedness is what will hopefully inspire some people to go experience it in new places,” said Pachelli, “because I think that’s the ultimate way to learn about yourself, see the world, and engage with your fellow tennis obsessives somewhere else.”"
style,Dubai’s Burj Azizi to become the world’s second-tallest building,2024-09-05,Rebecca Cairns,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights.

CNN —

Dubai’s super-sized skyline is already home to the world’s tallest skyscraper. Now, it is set to welcome the world’s second tallest, too.

The Burj Azizi broke ground in January this year, but its exact height was not disclosed at the time as its developer awaited approval from Dubai authorities, including the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), which is involved in planning for “supertall” buildings.

On Wednesday, however, real estate firm Azizi Developments announced that its skyscraper will tower over neighboring landmarks — all but one, that is — at a staggering 725 meters (2,379 feet) tall.

“From the outset, we had plans for two designs — one for the initially approved height of 526 meters, and the other for the taller, now-approved 725 meters,” Mirwais Azizi, the founder and chairman of Azizi Developments, told CNN in a written statement.

The developer kept its “options open for both scenarios” when it began preparatory works earlier this year. But with the green light given for the building’s more ambitious proposal, additional work to the foundations and piling is “well underway,” Azizi added.

The 131-story skyscraper will feature apartments, an all-suite “seven-star” luxury hotel and a seven-floor “vertical” shopping mall.

Located on Sheikh Zayed Road, in Dubai’s World Trade Center district, Burj Azizi will still stand almost 340 feet shorter than the 2,717-foot-tall Burj Khalifa, less than two miles away. But it will handily beat local competition for the city’s second-tallest title, exceeding the current holder, Marina 101 (1,394 feet).

Once topped out, it will also exceed the world’s current second-tallest building, Malaysia’s 2,227-foot-tall Merdeka 118.

The tower is anticipated to set several records, including the world’s highest hotel lobby (on level 11), the world’s highest nightclub (on level 126) and the world’s highest observation deck (on level 130), according to Azizi Developments. The developer also said the building will clinch the record for Dubai’s highest restaurant (meaning its 122nd-floor venue will be higher than the Burj Khalifa’s 122nd-floor restaurant, At.mosphere) and the city’s highest hotel room, on the tower’s 118th floor.

In a press release, Azizi said investment in the project has surpassed 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion).

“My vision for Burj Azizi is to create a lasting legacy, a tribute to Dubai as a destination of choice for both residents and visitors and a monumental achievement in engineering,” said Azizi in the release.

Dubai currently has more towers measuring over 300 meters (984 feet) than any other city worldwide, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

The city is no stranger to superlative structures. It boasts the world’s highest infinity pool, the world’s largest natural flower garden, and the world’s largest picture frame, to name a few.

There are many more under construction, too: The Franck Muller Aeternitas Tower hopes to claim the title of the world’s tallest residential clock tower when it opens in 2027, and Ciel Dubai Marina, scheduled for completion later this year, is expected to become the world’s tallest hotel. The Burj Binghatti Jacob & Co Residences, meanwhile, is set to become the world’s tallest residential structure (and Dubai’s third-tallest building) at 1,952 feet.

Burj Azizi is slated for completion in 2028, with apartments expected to go on sale in February 2025."
style,See inside Jennifer Garner’s tranquil farmhouse-style home,2024-09-03,Jacqui Palumbo,"Since building a home for herself and her three kids over the past few years, Jennifer Garner has shown glimpses of the sunny farmhouse dwelling through her social media posts. The kitchen’s exposed wood beams and stone fireplace can be seen as she carries her fluffy cat, Moose, to places in the home he’s “never seen before” (inside the refrigerator and microwave, up high to peer at the family aquarium). She showed off her home gym and hillside pool views, too, filming herself as she trained to reprise the role of Elektra — and also, jokingly, announced that she had failed to make the Olympic Games.

But until now, Garner hasn’t given a full tour inside her Westside Los Angeles property. That’s all changed with Architectural Digest’s latest cover story, which reveals a cheerful, rustic space designed and constructed from the ground up by Steve and Brooke Giannetti — with help from designer Laura Putnam — who are well-known with design circles for building spacious and light-filled arcadian houses integrated with the natural world.

“I wanted (the home) to feel old and cool and historic, but I also wanted to make it work for a big family with a lot of things going on,” Garner told AD for the October issue. She had searched for a home with privacy, but the ones she toured all felt too “grand,” she explained. Instead, she tasked the Giannetti’s with building an entirely new space, which they based on the actor’s memories of her childhood in West Virginia, according to AD.

“I had this idea of creating something that felt like a farmhouse and a barn,” Steve said in the cover story. “We wanted natural wood, coziness—a kind of warm embrace of a house for her because she’s such a lovely person.”

The home reflects that sense of comfort, with natural materials and a neutral color scheme topped off with antique and repurposed furniture in the living room, brass chandeliers and marble countertops in kitchen, and a nickel soaking tub with views of the greenery outside.

“There’s also something a bit whimsical about her,” Brooke added. “And she likes gentle shapes, curves. This place is kind of the house version of Jen’s personality.”

There’s plenty of opportunities to connect with nature, too. The kitchen opens up to the tranquil pool and a bucolic fruit and vegetable garden, while floral and arboreal wallpaper appear in the kids’ rooms and bathrooms. It’s a house fully in use, too, rather than siloed off — a rarity for a house with multiple pre-teens and teenagers.

“I am happy that I feel like we use the space really well, and that the kids are all over the house,” Garner said. They’re as comfortable sitting in the living room as they are doing homework in the dining room. And that’s the dream, right?”

That’s the vision that Garner had, the designers explained — a thoughtful approach to how everyone might use the space once it was built. Perhaps most touching are the stained-glass windows in the study and reading room, inspired by the children’s book “All the World” by Marla Freeze — a cherished book in the family. The windows were made by the author’s son, the artist Reed Bradley, as a tribute to his mother’s work. But he incorporated Garner and her family into the symbolism of the windows, with owls representing each of the kids, as well as an appearance by their dog, Birdie."
sport,Deshaun Watson: Cleveland Browns quarterback accused of 2020 sexual assault in new lawsuit,2024-09-10,"Ben Church, Wayne Sterling","Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has been accused of sexual assault and battery which allegedly occurred in 2020, according to a civil lawsuit filed Monday by a woman in Harris County, Texas.

In the lawsuit obtained by CNN, a woman identified as “Jane Doe” claims that Watson sexually assaulted her in her apartment before a dinner date in October 2020.

According to the lawsuit, Watson – who was playing for the Houston Texans at the time – had become angry when he initially couldn’t find the woman’s apartment, yelling at her on the phone.

When inside, as the woman was getting ready in the bathroom, Watson allegedly took off his clothes and demanded a massage to his buttocks while lying on her bed.

According to the filing, the woman, Jane Doe, said she was terrified.

“She was in her small apartment with a much larger man. … Doe thus tried to appease Watson by rubbing his back, rather than his buttocks,” the suit reads.

Watson insisted she massage his buttocks, but she refused, and he became frustrated, according to the suit.

“Jane froze in fear, unsure of how to refuse Watson’s advances without jeopardizing her safety,” the suit alleges.

According to the lawsuit, Watson disrobed the woman and “penetrated her … without consent, implicit or explicit.”

The suit alleges: “Jane Doe felt paralyzed, unsure if she should risk her safety by trying to stop Watson or endure his assault.”

The sexual assault allegedly lasted for “several minutes” before the woman broke free and grabbed a heavy object for protection, the suit adds. The lawsuit claims Watson then “stormed out” of the apartment.

Neither Watson’s legal representatives, the Browns, the Texans nor the NFL Players Association have responded to CNN’s request for comment.

The NFL declined to comment when contacted by CNN.

Jane Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $1 million, the lawsuit states.

In 2022, the NFL and the NFLPA agreed to suspend Watson for 11 regular season games without pay and fine him $5 million after at least 24 civil lawsuits were filed on behalf of women alleging the quarterback sexually harassed or assaulted them during private massage appointments while he was playing for the Texans.

Watson repeatedly denied wrongdoing in those cases, and 23 of the lawsuits were settled confidentially. Two grand juries declined to charge Watson criminally.

“I’m moving on with my career and my life, and I’m going to continue to stand on my innocence,” Watson said at the time.

“Just because settlements and things like that happen, doesn’t mean that person is guilty for anything,” he said.

In 2022, the Browns traded three first-round picks for Watson and then signed him to a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history at the time."

sport,NFL Week 1 takeaways: Are the Dallas Cowboys for real?,2024-09-10,Ben Morse,"There are 17 weeks of the 2024 NFL regular season remaining, but there are some things we can learn from Week 1 of the new campaign.

A few of the favorites had strong starts and several of the teams who had been hoping for improvement struggled.

Here are the main takeaways from Week 1.

The Dallas Cowboys look like contenders

The Dallas Cowboys under head coach Mike McCarthy have been regular season juggernauts without much playoff success to show for it.

‘America’s Team’ has suffered consecutive humiliating postseason defeats under McCarthy, ramping up the pressure on the 60-year-old ahead of the new season.

That spotlight only intensified with a contract holdout involving star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and questions over quarterback Dak Prescott’s future.

But those issues were resolved – Lamb signed a new contract two weeks before the regular season kicked off while Prescott agreed to his new extension, becoming the highest-paid player in NFL history, just hours before Week 1 began.

And Dallas played like a team freed from the weight of pressure against the Cleveland Browns in their season-opener, romping to a comfortable 33-17 victory where every facet of the team shined.

Prescott, Lamb and the rest of the offense moved the ball proficiently against a stacked Browns defense, Micah Parsons and his defensive teammates wreaked havoc while kicker Brandon Aubrey is slowly cementing himself as the heir-apparent to the Baltimore Ravens’ Justin Tucker as the league’s best kicker.

They even got a punt-return touchdown early in the third quarter from KaVontae Turpin as the icing on the cake in Ohio.

All-in-all, it was an impressive performance which begins laying the foundation for the Cowboys’ Super Bowl aspirations after a turbulent offseason.

There are still plenty of hurdles for the team to overcome, with the ever-watching eyes of owner Jerry Jones resting on McCarthy, but it was the perfect start for Dallas as it seeks to win its first Lombardi Trophy since 1996.

The AFC South has an exciting future

For years, the AFC South has struggled for relevancy, but that might all be about to change.

Sunday’s Week 1 clash between the Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts offered an insight into what could come for the division with both teams boasting young, exciting second-year quarterbacks, each with a promising future.

Houston’s CJ Stroud enjoyed a historic rookie season last time out, while Indianapolis’ Anthony Richardson showed glimpses of brilliance as he battled injuries.

When the two faced off in Lucas Oil Stadium, they showed why they were so highly sought after in the 2023 Draft – Stroud went No. 2 overall while Richardson got selected two picks later.

Stroud missed just eight throws all afternoon, racking up a 115.9 QB rating as he threw for 234 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, in an almost flawless performance to begin his second season with a bang.

Richardson, on the other hand, showed some of the inexperience he still possesses – he only had 13 career college starts and played in just four games last year – but also why he is being tipped for future stardom.

The 22-year-old only completed nine passes and had a head-scratching interception but also had some of the most impressive throws of Week 1, most notably two long touchdown passes – one for 60 yards which set social media alight and another for 54 yards. The young Colts signal-caller also ran for another score.

After the defeat, Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen was full of praise for Richardson, saying there’s “not many guys” who can produce what he can.

“”I thought he made some big-time plays for us,” Steichen told reporters, per the Colts website. “Obviously, that opening touchdown pass to Alec (Pierce), I don’t think I’ve seen a throw like that.

“And then he hit another big one to Alec right there at the end on the two-minute drive, to get down there and score. He had Ashton on the in-cut. Then fourth down, got to have it. I mean, he just powered his will to go get in. I thought he did some really good things coming back.”

The pairing of Stroud and Richardson could set the AFC South up nicely for years to come with some titanic battles on the horizon. And with former No. 1 overall pick Trevor Lawrence in Jacksonville, it’s anyone’s guess which team has the brightest future.

Another long season ahead in Carolina

After a 2-15 season last year, 2024 was meant to be a new era of hope for the Carolina Panthers.

However, things got off to the worst possible start in Week 1 with a humbling 47-10 defeat at the hands of the New Orleans Saints.

Last year’s No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young – who Carolina acquired by trading wide receiver DJ Moore and multiple first round picks – looked lost, despite a new head coach calling his plays.

Dave Canales was appointed in the offseason after rejuvenating the careers of Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield in Seattle and Tampa Bay respectively with the hopes he could have a similar impact on Young.

But the early signs were worrying for Young and Canales against the Saints, with the quarterback throwing an interception on his first play and another at the start of the second half. The 23-year-old looked overwhelmed throughout the game and, with New Orleans holding a huge lead in the second half, was benched for veteran Andy Dalton to prevent any further damage.

And if things couldn’t get any worse for the Panthers, news came out on Monday that arguably the team’s best player, defensive tackle Derrick Brown, could miss the remainder of the season after suffering a meniscus injury in the loss to the Saints.

“Definitely a huge loss,” Canales said, per the NFL. “He’s one of our best players. That’s big shoes to fill.”

The Panthers traded for the first pick of the 2022 Draft to acquire Young, earned last season’s top pick – which had been traded to the Bears in the deal for the second-year QB – and could be in line for the 2025 NFL Draft’s No. 1 pick if the season doesn’t improve quickly.

sport,Tyreek Hill: What we know about Miami Dolphins star’s detainment by police,2024-09-10,"George Ramsay, Ben Morse, Wayne Sterling, David Close, Kevin Dotson, Homero De La Fuente","It’s been an eventful few days for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill, who was handcuffed and detained by Miami-Dade Police shortly before his team’s opening game Sunday.

The detention, for what his agent called a moving violation, was just temporary, and Hill later scored a stellar 80-yard touchdown in a close win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He celebrated the score by putting his arms behind his back with his wrists together – a cheeky nod to his pregame incident.

But off the field, the detention has led to a public back-and-forth between the Dolphins and police and has renewed the debate over how law enforcement handles traffic stops and interacts with members of the public.

On Monday night, police released nearly two hours of body-camera footage showing the interaction with Hill and other Dolphins players at the scene. A police union criticized Hill as “uncooperative.”

In turn, the Dolphins organization released a statement criticizing the officers’ conduct, and Hill told CNN he remained confused by the encounter.

“I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it,” Hill said. “I’m embarrassed.”

Here’s what we know about Hill’s detention before the game on Sunday and its aftermath.

The Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) released body-worn camera footage from the incident unexpectedly on Monday night.

“While standard protocol is to release bodycam footage after the internal review has concluded, the available bodycam footage – a combined 105 minutes 33 seconds – is being released the day following the incident to reinforce the Department’s commitment to keeping the public informed,” Director Stephanie V. Daniels of the police department said in a statement.

The footage shows a police officer approaching Hill’s car and knocking on the window after he signaled for Hill to pull over. Hill rolls down the window when the officer knocks and replies, “Hey, don’t knock on my window like that.” The officer asks Hill why he doesn’t have a seatbelt on. Hill doesn’t answer and repeatedly says, “Don’t knock on my window like that.”

The officer asks why Hill had his window up and says he had to knock to let Hill know he was there.

“Give me my ticket bro so I can go, I’m going to be late. Do what you got to do,” Hill said before rolling up the window.

The officer tells him to keep his window down and knocks again, but Hill doesn’t appear to respond. The officer knocks again and tells Hill to keep his window down. Hill rolls down his window slightly and responds, “Don’t tell me what to do.”

The officer threatens to make Hill get out of the car if he doesn’t keep the window down, and then immediately after orders him out. Another officer opens Hill’s car door and starts to pull him out of the car, saying, “Get out!” while Hill responds, “I’m getting out.”

Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting out, I’m getting out,” and the same officer says, “Too late.”

Two officers are seen pushing Hill to the ground while another officer stands over. Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting arrested” multiple times, and the one officer physically restraining him says, “When we tell you to do something, you do it. You understand? You understand? Not what you want, but what we tell you. You’re a little f**cking confused.”

“Alright bro, take me to jail, bro do what you gotta do,” Hill says. “We will,” the officer responds.

The time from when the officer first knocks on Hill’s window to when he is fully handcuffed on the ground is around a minute and a half. The officers then move Hill to his feet and have him sit on the sidewalk. As an officer slowly leads him to sit on the ground, Hill says “Hold on, bro. I just had surgery on my knee.” As he is speaking, another officer comes behind him and puts an arm around his chest. He begins to pull Hill toward the ground as Hill repeats, “I just had surgery on my knee.”

The restraining officer says, “Really, what a coincidence. Did you have surgery on your ears when we told you to put the window down?”

“Bro, chill!” Hill yells.

Hill tells CNN he’s still in shock

Hill spoke with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Monday, saying everything happened very fast.

“I was following rules, I wasn’t moving fast because you know I got injuries, I got things that I go through. I play a physical sport, I’ve been doing this for a moment now man so I’m dealing with some stuff, so I guess the officers, they felt like I wasn’t doing it on their timing. I was doing it, but I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it,” Hill said. “I’m embarrassed.”

Hill further reflected on the moment that things escalated, saying that it started when officers asked him to roll down his window.

“When the officer came up and knocked on my window, I let my window down, cooperated, gave them my I.D. Then I immediately let up my window, and then after that I let back up my window, and then he came back to the window and was like, ‘Let your window down now, let your window down now’ and then I let it down,” Hill said.

“I’m not trying to cause a scene because … if I let my window down, people walking by, driving by, they’re going to notice that it’s me and they’re going to start taking pictures. I didn’t want to create a scene at all, I just really wanted to get the ticket and then just go out about my way and have a great Sunday.”

The 30-year-old was asked about an earlier quote of his about how the situation could’ve unfolded differently if he wasn’t Tyreek Hill.

“The reality of it is, it’s the truth. If I wasn’t Tyreek Hill, worst-case scenario, we would’ve had a different article. ‘Tyreek Hill got shot in front of Hard Rock Stadium,’ that’s worst-case scenario,” Hill said. “It’s crazy that me and my family had to go through this.”

A second Dolphins player, Calais Campbell, was also handcuffed when trying to discuss the situation with officers at the scene, according to police.

Speaking to ESPN on Monday, the 38-year-old defensive lineman recalled how he arrived at the scene of his teammate’s detention and attempted to diffuse the situation. He said he got out of his car with his hands up and approached the police officers, explaining, “I’m a friend of his (Hill). I don’t know what’s going on here, but I think the situation is definitely unnecessary.”

Campbell said he was told to leave, with an officer threatening to tow his car if he didn’t go away.

“I told him I will stand where you want me to stand. You tell me how far I need to back up, and I’ll back up, but I’m not leaving the scene,” Campbell recounted. “This is my friend here. I’m here to support him. I’m not leaving.”

When he remained, Campbell said the officer told him he was under arrest and put him in handcuffs.

Campbell said Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith was also at the scene as Hill pleaded with both teammates: “Don’t leave me. Don’t leave me.”

Now in his 17th season, Campbell has previously won the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award, given annually to a player “for his excellence on and off the field.” This is his first season with the Dolphins.

Campbell told ESPN he was thankful he was there to support Hill.

“These situations can escalate quickly. We see it so many times in America where these things go completely bad. This is a big opportunity for us to use this platform to combat police brutality that happens. This situation could have been a whole lot worse had we not been there.”

Dolphins organization slams police conduct

After the bodycam footage was released, the Miami Dolphins released a three-paragraph statement criticizing the “the overly aggressive and violent conduct directed towards Tyreek Hill, Calais Campbell and Jonnu Smith by police officers.”

“It is both maddening and heartbreaking to watch the very people we trust to protect our community use such unnecessary force and hostility towards these players, yet it is also a reminder that not every situation like this ends in peace, as we are grateful this one did,” the team said.

The team said they have a positive relationship with the police and praised the “vast majority of officers.”

“However, as is on full display in the videos released tonight, there are some officers who mistake their responsibility and commitment to serve with misguided power,” the team said. “While we commend MDPD for taking the right and necessary action to quickly release this footage, we also urge them to take equally swift and strong action against the officers who engaged in such despicable behavior.”

Earlier Monday, Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel said he was unsettled by the incident.

“It’s been hard for me not to find myself more upset the more I think about it,” McDaniel said at a press conference. “And that’s because of my teammates and trying to put myself in that situation that they described emotionally, and then knowing more than that, the thing that f**ks me up, honestly, is knowing that I don’t know exactly what that feels like.”

“I do think that it’s supremely important to wait for information to be gathered before any rush to judement, but regardless I know the feelings expressed to me are unsettling,” he added.

Still, he said two positive things came from the incident. “I’m super proud of teammates being teammates, and super proud of our guys understanding the civic responsibility of a platform and intending to do right by it.”

Hill’s agent Drew Rosenhaus described the incident as “heartbreaking, upsetting and uncalled for,” saying he was “in disbelief” about what took place ahead of the game.

“Tyreek was just trying to get to work, trying to play a game, just trying to do his job,” Rosenhaus said on “CNN News Central.” “For police officers to detain him, to put him on the ground like that, to put their knee on him, to hit him – it’s just devastating.”

In separate comments to ESPN, Rosenhaus said that Hill was “OK physically” but mentally “very distraught” by the situation, adding: “Tyreek has told me over and over he’s a big supporter of police. He was telling the police there, ‘I want to be a police officer in the future.’ But this is crazy, I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Police union says Hill was not cooperative

Daniels, the police director, said she initiated an internal investigation into the incident, adding that one of the officers involved has been placed on administrative duties.

“I’m committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.”

The local police union has defended the actions of the officers involved.

“Upon being stopped, Mr. Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr. Hill in handcuffs,” Steadman Stahl, president of the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement to CNN.

“Mr. Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground. Once the situation was sorted out within a few minutes, Mr. Hill was issued two traffic citations and was free to leave.

“In this case, while we will wait for the investigation to run its course, based on what we know, we stand with the actions of our officers but look forward to further open communication moving forward,” Stahl added.

Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, meanwhile, praised the “immediate steps” taken by the MDPD in the aftermath of the incident to investigate what occurred.

“In recent years our nation has confronted important conversations on the use of force, and the internal review process will answer questions about why the troubling actions shown in public video footage were taken by the officer,” Levine Cava said on Instagram.

“We will continue to keep our community informed about this process and findings will be made available – critical to maintaining the public trust that MDPD has earned with our community. I look forward to learning more from the internal review process and to updating the public as the review concludes.”"
sport,Raygun: Viral Olympian ranked No. 1 breaker in the world by sport’s governing body,2024-09-10,"Samuel Joseph, Sam Joseph","Australian breaker Rachael Gunn, the Olympian widely known as B-Girl Raygun who went viral after her performance at the Paris Games, is now ranked the No. 1 breaker in the world.

The 37-year-old claimed the top spot in the latest women’s rankings released by the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) – the governing body of breaking and other dancesports.

Raygun’s performances failed to score any points across her Olympic battles against breakers from the United States, France and Lithuania in August, losing 18-0 in all three rounds.

However, she won the gold medal at the 2023 WDSF Oceania Championships, securing her 1,000 ranking points and vaulting her up to No. 1 – level on points with world No. 2 B-Girl Riko of Japan – ahead of the breakers who defeated her in the French capital. Her victory at the Oceania Championships also secured her a spot in Paris.

In an odd twist, none of the Olympic B-Girl medalists are ranked inside the top 10. Japan’s Ami, Lithuania’s Nicka and China’s 671 earned gold, silver and bronze respectively.

In a statement, the WDSF on Tuesday clarified that its rankings are updated based on each athlete’s top four performances within the past 12 months. Points earned in these competitions remain valid for 52 weeks from the date of the event.

The governing body also confirmed that the Olympic qualifying events in Shanghai and Budapest, as well as the Paris Games themselves, did not contribute to the ranking list due to limited athlete quotas. Additionally, WDSF said that events which traditionally give ranking points were not held to allow competitors to fully focus on preparation for the Games.

“In alignment with the Olympic Qualification System, ranking events were intentionally not held between 31 December 2023 and the Olympic Games Paris 2024. This strategic scheduling allowed athletes to focus solely on the last part of their Olympic qualification without the added pressure of additional ranking events.

“By the end of the Olympic Games, many of the competition results included in the ranking had expired, leading to the current situation where many athletes have only one competition result contributing to their ranking.”

It added that the current rankings should be looked at “in conjunction” with more recent results and that the list will change when the next batch of 12-month points expire and the Breaking for Gold World Series is held in Shanghai in October.

Raygun shot to fame after her unique routine at the Olympics drew the world’s attention.

Dressed in the green and gold tracksuit of Australia, she displayed some unorthodox moves, including a kangaroo hop, a backward roll and various contortions with her body while lying or crawling on the floor.

She received criticism online for her performance, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling her routines “hilariously ridiculous,” and another questioning how she had made it this far.

Celebrities took notice as well – singer Adele took time out of her concert in Munich to ask whether the whole thing was a “joke,” while actress Rachel Dratch imitated some of the moves on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”

Raygun – who is a university lecturer by day – recently apologized to the breaking community, saying that she was “very sorry for the backlash that the community has experienced” after her performance. She has been defended by some within the sport.

“It’s all about originality and it’s all about bringing something new to the table and representing your country or region,” said Martin Gilian, the chief breaking judge at the Olympics, also known as MGbility.

“She created some original moves which could be maybe funny or entertaining for others, but for us, she basically represented breaking and hip hop. She was trying to be original and bring something new to the table. From our perspective, that was nothing really shocking.”

Raygun described the online reaction as “devastating” but has remained upbeat about the entire experience.

“I knew that I was going to get beaten, and I knew that people were not going to understand my style and what I was going to do,” she said in an interview with Australian current affairs show The Project. “The odds were against me, that’s for sure.”

“I would much rather focus on the positives out of this, and the positive responses and the joy that I brought people,” she said. “It’s going out there and just having fun and going as hard as you can in the face of, you know, losing.”

Breaking made its Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games but will not feature in Los Angeles in 2028."
tech,"Telegram boss Pavel Durov faces formal investigation with bail of $5 million, prosecutor says",2024-08-28,"Chris Liakos, Rob Picheta","Paris CNN —

Telegram founder Pavel Durov is under formal investigation and will not be allowed to leave France, a French prosecutor said in a statement released Wednesday night.

The Russian-born billionaire is being investigated for several suspected offenses related to criminal activity on the platform, including complicity in illegal gang transactions, “laundering of crimes in an organized gang,” and refusal to communicate information to authorities, according to the French prosecutor’s statement.

He must remain in the country under judicial supervision, with a bail set at $5.56 million (5 million euros), and is required to report to the French police station twice a week.

Durov was released from police custody in France earlier in the day and transferred to court for questioning, prosecutors told CNN, days after his dramatic arrest at a Paris airport.

The formal investigation announced Wednesday evening does not imply guilt in the French legal system, but indicates that prosecutors believe there is enough of a case to merit a serious official investigation. He has not yet been formally charged.

Wednesday’s prosecutor’s office statement added that the French National Office for Minors has reported to the prosecutor’s office the “near absence of response” from Telegram to court requests concerning offenses that include trafficking, online hate speech, and pedophilia crimes.

The suspected acts being probed include “complicity in the administration of a platform enabling an illegal transaction in an organized gang,” an offense that can carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Durov, 39, was detained at Paris’s Bourget Airport on Saturday on a warrant related to Telegram’s lack of moderation. He was being investigated on charges relating to a host of crimes, including allegations that his platform was complicit in aiding fraudsters, drug traffickers and people spreading child pornography.

Telegram, and its lack of content moderation, has also come under scrutiny for its use by terrorist groups and far-right extremists.

He was placed in custody for up to 96 hours, the maximum amount of time someone can be held under French law before being charged.

Durov’s arrest started a row over freedom of speech, and caused particular concerns in both Ukraine and Russia, where it is extremely popular and has become a key communication tool among military personnel and citizens during Moscow’s war on its neighbor.

Russia criticized Paris on Wednesday for its detention of Durov. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, “It seems to me that all this has once again demonstrated the true attitude of the French leadership, which has blatantly trampled on international norms in the field of ​​protecting freedom of speech and expression, for only one reason - because if they protect certain standards, they must not only comply with them, they must protect and implement them.”

The Kremlin has sought to calm fears in Russia about the future of the app, with Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov attempting to dispel calls for users to delete their sensitive messages on the app.

‘No way political’

French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said the decision to bring charges against Durov was “in no way political,” a rare intervention by a French leader into a judicial matter.

Telegram was launched in 2013 by Durov and his brother, Nikolai. The app now has more than 950 million users, according to a post from Durov last month, making it one of the most widely used messaging platforms in the world.

Conversations on the app are encrypted, meaning that law enforcement agencies – and Telegram itself – have little oversight on what users post.

Durov was born in the Soviet Union in 1984, and in his 20s became colloquially known as the “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia.” He left the country in 2014 and now lives in Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered, while also holding French citizenship.

He is worth an estimated $9.15 billion, according to Bloomberg, and has maintained a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle over the past decade.

But while his app has won plaudits from free speech groups and enabled private communication in countries with restrictive regimes, critics say it has become a safe haven for people coordinating illicit activities - including the terrorists who planned the Paris terror attacks in November 2015.

“You cannot make it safe against criminals and open for governments,” Durov told CNN in 2016. “It’s either secure or not secure.”

tech,AT&T just had another outage. Why does this keep happening to them?,2024-08-28,Jordan Valinsky,"New York CNN —

On Tuesday, AT&T wireless service went down for some customers, affecting their ability to contact 911 in the event of an emergency.

It was fixed in a few hours, with the company blaming a software issue, but it’s just one of many problems the telecommunications company has faced over the past several months, including outages and data breaches that have hampered its operations and left users in the lurch.

In February its network went down for 11 hours, preventing many of its customers across the United States from placing calls, texting or accessing the internet. AT&T said an initial review of the outage found it may have been caused by an error within the company and not a cyberattack.

A few weeks later in March, a data leak that included personal information of 73 million current and former customers was released into the “dark web,” sparking security concerns. The data came from 2019 or earlier and did not appear to contain financial information or specifics about call history, the company said. “It is not yet known whether the data … originated from AT&T or one of its vendors,” the company said at the time.

Then, in June, another AT&T outage prevented some customers from completing calls between carriers. The issue was solved within a few hours, but the company didn’t reveal what caused the issue.

And a security nightmare was revealed last month when the call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach.

Compromised data included the telephone numbers of “nearly all” of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022.

Notably, Tuesday’s outage came just hours after the Federal Communications Commission announced a $950,000 settlement with AT&T to resolve an investigation into whether or not the company violated FCC rules by failing to deliver 911 calls and timely notify 911 call centers during a previous outage in August 2023.

AT&T’s overload

So, why does this keep happening to AT&T? One telecommunications expert with whom CNN spoke believes it’s a combination of three issues, including overloaded networks in major cities, software updates that have gone haywire and various technical problems.

On Tuesday, an outage map showed disruptions in New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston and Chicago. Alex Besen, founder and CEO of Besen Group, which analyzes mobile phone companies, said that led him believe it was a network overload issue.

“To avoid any future outages, AT&T needs to increase the number of cell towers, implement advanced load-balancing techniques, use network optimization tools to manage traffic more effectively and prioritize services that can reduce congestion,” Besen told CNN.

Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, said AT&T’s response about Tuesday’s outage being a software issue left it “unclear if that is on the implementation side or a bug in the code.”

“Customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with AT&T for repeated outages and customer service leaving the issue unresolved as they await critical updates,” Lightman told CNN.

He added that, in AT&T’s defense, it’s “also important to note the complexity of the network infrastructure to service 115 million wireless subs as well as their aggressive rollout plans of new networks.”

“Our customers expect and deserve reliable connectivity,” an AT&T spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “When service disruptions occur, our team of network experts work to restore service as quickly as possible. We value our customers and keeping them connected is our top priority.”

tech,Elon Musk hits out at judge threatening to suspend X in Brazil,2024-08-29,Duarte Mendonca,"Elon Musk has stepped up online attacks on a Supreme Court judge threatening to suspend social media platform X in Brazil, calling him “an evil dictator” in an ongoing feud between the two men.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes had threatened to suspend X if Musk did not appoint a new legal representative of the company in Brazil and settle any outstanding daily fines within 24 hours.

“Alexandre de Moraes is an evil dictator cosplaying as a judge,” the world’s richest person wrote on X.

Musk, who had previously called de Moraes “Darth Vader,” retweeted a statement from X’s Global Government Affairs team saying it would publish the judge’s “illegal demands and all related court filings” in the coming days.

Brazil is a major market for social media platforms. About 40 million Brazilians, or about 18% of the population, access X at least once per month, according to the Associated Press.

The trash talking marks the latest salvo in Musk’s feud with de Moraes, which centers on arguments over free speech and alleged disinformation. X announced earlier this month that it would close its operations and fire its staff in Brazil due to what it called “censorship orders” from the judge.

De Moraes had ordered the social media company to block several X accounts he said were spreading disinformation.

The latest statement, which was signed by de Moraes, was also shared on the Supreme Court’s official X account, tagging both Musk and X’s Global Government Affairs account.

The statement from the Supreme Court was posted at around 8.30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, giving Musk until Thursday evening local time to respond.

‘Censorship orders’

On August 17, X published a lengthy statement saying it would be forced to close operations and fire staff in Brazil due to de Moraes’ “censorship orders.”

“Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process,” the X statement said.

“As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately. The X service remains available to the people of Brazil. We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision. The responsibility lies solely with Alexandre de Moraes.”

Later that day, Musk reiterated the official X statement, saying his company had “no choice” but to close Brazilian operations.

“Due to demands by ‘Justice’ Alexandre [de Moraes] in Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, X has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil,” he said in an X post."

politics,Vance says incendiary claim he spread against Haitian migrants could be false but urges followers to keep posting ‘cat memes’,2024-09-10,Kit Maher,"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance acknowledged Tuesday that it’s possible the “rumors” of Haitian immigrants abducting pets of Springfield, Ohio, residents might “turn out to be false,” but encouraged his followers to continue posting “cat memes.”

“In the last several weeks, my office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants. It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false,” Vance posted on X

“Do you know what’s confirmed? That a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant who had no right to be here,” Vance continued, also pointing to the impact migration has had on health and education services.

Vance appeared to be referring to an incident last year in which an 11-year-old child was killed in a bus crash in Springfield involving a Haitian immigrant driver who had a foreign license that was not valid in Ohio, as reported by The New York Times. The driver involved has been convicted of first-degree felony involuntary manslaughter and fourth-degree felony vehicular homicide, according to the Springfield News-Sun.

The Times reported that city officials estimated an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants to the town in recent years. The report said the arrivals overwhelmed community health clinics, which saw a 13-times increase from 2021-2023, and put a strain on housing and schools.

“If you’re a reporter, or an activist, who didn’t give a shit about these suffering Americans until yesterday, I have some advice: Spare your outrage for your fellow citizens suffering under Kamala Harris’s policies. Be outraged at yourself for letting this happen,” he continued.

In a follow-up post, Vance said, “In short, don’t let the crybabies in the media dissuade you, fellow patriots. Keep the cat memes flowing.”

Vance promoted false claims on Monday that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets, though his post on Tuesday made no mention of Haitians “eating” them. It’s the latest turn in a campaign that has increasingly embraced race-baiting messaging, questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity while seeking to undermine her immigration policies.

The unsubstantiated claims appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. They spread widely on X, whose owner, Elon Musk, has embraced the false rumors and posted several memes that promoted them.

In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said, “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.”"

politics,"Median income rose to $80,610 in 2023",2024-09-10,Tami Luhby,"Americans’ incomes have finally returned to their pre-pandemic peak.

Median household income rose to $80,610 in 2023, essentially the same as it was in 2019, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.

The typical household’s income rose 4% from 2022, driven primarily by an increase in workers’ earnings. This was the first statistically significant annual increase in inflation-adjusted median household income since 2019, the Census Bureau said.

“This is the firmest evidence yet that income growth outpaced inflation for ordinary households in 2023,” said Arloc Sherman, vice president for data analysis and research at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Americans’ finances are a key talking point in this year’s presidential election. Former President Donald Trump argues that people were better off in his first term and have suffered from the spike in prices in recent years. Vice President Kamala Harris has stressed that she will focus on strengthening the middle class and has released proposals that aim to reduce people’s cost of living.

There were widespread gains across the income ladder, though income inequality did not change significantly between 2022 and 2023.

However, the inflation-adjusted median earnings for men who worked full time, year-round increased 3% – twice the rate for women. That contributed to the female-to-male earnings ratio falling to 82.7% last year, down from 84% the year before. It was the first statistically significant annual decline in the ratio since 2003.

The official poverty measure fell to 11.1% in 2023, down 0.4 percentage points from the year before. There were 36.8 million people in poverty, essentially the same as the prior year.

But the supplemental poverty measure – which takes into account taxes paid, tax credits and noncash assistance, among other metrics – rose to 12.9%, up 0.5 percentage points from 2022.

The split between the two measures was primarily driven by the differences in the way the Census Bureau annually updates the poverty thresholds, or the definition of basic needs, for each measure. The continued high inflation for housing costs in 2023 contributed to the increase in the supplemental measure.

The supplemental poverty measure has been closely watched in recent years because it showed the impact of many federal Covid-19 pandemic relief programs. The poverty rate for children fell by nearly half to 5.2% in 2021, in large part because of the one-year enhancement to the child tax credit. However, the rate returned the following year to 12.4%, roughly where it was prior to the pandemic. Last year, it increased to 13.7%.

Expanding the child tax credit is in the spotlight in this year’s presidential campaign. Harris has proposed restoring the pandemic enhancement, which provided as much as $3,600 per kid, as well as creating a $6,000 credit for newborns. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has said he’d like to increase the credit to $5,000 per child.

Meanwhile, the uninsured rate was 8% in 2023, roughly the same as last year and near historic lows. The share of people with employment-based health insurance coverage fell 0.7 percentage points to 53.7% last year.

The uninsured rate is expected to rise this year, in part because a pandemic-era law that barred states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients thought to no longer be eligible expired in April 2023.

Separately, a record 20.8 million people were enrolled in Affordable Care Act policies as of February, the Biden administration announced Tuesday. Interest in Obamacare plans has surged in recent years, driven in part by a temporary enhancement to the federal premium subsidies that congressional Democrats enacted when they controlled Capitol Hill. That boost is set to expire at the end of 2025.

Nearly 50 million people have been covered by policies purchased through the Affordable Care Act exchanges since the program began in 2014, the administration said.

politics,"What to watch during the Trump, Harris debate on ABC",2024-09-10,Gregory Krieg,"Kamala Harris on Tuesday night faces a task unprecedented in modern political history. On the debate stage in Philadelphia, she will deliver both an opening argument – to the millions of voters who want to know more about her – and a closing argument – for her candidacy and against Donald Trump’s – as their lightning campaign enters its final eight weeks.

The former president will also find himself in uncharted waters. After skipping the Republican primary debates, Trump will now square off with his second Democratic rival in as many outings – but unlike President Joe Biden, whose campaign imploded onstage in Atlanta in June, Harris presents a vastly different challenge.

Harris has so far enjoyed a charmed campaign. She pounced on the nomination after Biden dropped out in July, then surged – in the polls and on the fundraising front – in the following weeks. Her cash advantage is clear. She raised $361 million in August alone, nearly three times Trump’s haul. But the horse race is as close as ever, and there is increasing demand in the electorate for more information about Harris and her policy agenda – a knowledge gap that creates opportunities and stumbling blocks for both camps.

There is less mystery surrounding Trump. This is his record seventh presidential general election debate. On the trail, he has thrown out a typically Trumpian mish-mosh of often self-contradicting pledges and positions, promoted then fled from the now-infamous “Project 2025,” and otherwise sought to tie Harris to Biden’s record, particularly on the border, while frequently issuing gender- and race-baiting personal attacks.

The fundamental question ahead of their meeting in Philadelphia, one of the highest-stakes national debates in a generation, is whether – and how – one of them can deliver a compelling message to swing voters while bolstering the confidence of their respective bases.

Here are six things to watch for on Tuesday night:

Will Harris deliver the policy message voters say they want to hear?

Harris has been vice president for nearly four years and spent about the same amount of time before that on Capitol Hill, as California’s junior senator. She ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Still, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they needed to know more about her.

For Trump, the figure was 9%.

More than her convention speech, the debate will provide a platform for Harris to answer some of those questions. So far, she has drilled down with particular focus on two issues: cost of living and reproductive rights. The latter is an obvious place of strength. Her position is vastly more popular than Trump’s and her ability to speak about it is significantly stronger than Biden’s. It also fits neatly into a broader message about personal freedoms.

The economy is a stickier wicket. Her campaign has, so far, sought to stay close to what the Biden administration has been preaching while, at the same time, injecting it with a populist freshness that excites Democrats and wins over skeptical undecided voters.

And while there’s little reason to expect Harris to deviate from her strategy, which has been to speak in broad terms while rationing specifics, she will be pushed – by the debate moderators and, in his own way, Trump – to provide a clearer picture of how she ranks her priorities.

Harris is also likely to be pressed on some recent policy switcharoos. Plastic straws are back in, for example, after she once suggested banning them, while “Medicare for All,” in all its forms, is out.

The second Harris presidential campaign has offered a significant correction of the first, an uneven primary bid that flamed out before a vote was cast. So many of the things Harris expressed openness to, if not outright support for, are now off the menu five years later. Where she is now seems both closer politically to Biden and her own long political history.

Allies describe it as an evolution, evidence of her open and inquisitive mind.

Rivals, led by Trump, tell it differently. To them, Harris’s shifting positions represent a lack of political scruples and an overabundance of ambition. With Trump, goes the familiar argument, the people know where he stands, whether they agree or not.

So which narrative will win out Tuesday night? The question is as much for Trump as it is for Harris. The vice president will surely enter with a plan to funnel the expected criticism into a more front-footed message about her plans going forward. The risk there is being seen as disingenuous, in not acknowledging what’s plain to see.

Trump, though, has a habit of overplaying a good hand. Staying focused on the specifics would seem the wiser path, given his apparent inability, or refusal, to launch a personal attack not juiced up with outrageous or bigoted language.

Which Trump shows up onstage in Philadelphia?

Trump turned 78 about two weeks before he took the stage with Biden in Georgia. And while the president’s difficulties rightfully dominated the post-debate narrative, Trump, too, appears diminished from his first and second campaigns.

Last week, the former president was asked at economic forum if he would “commit to prioritizing legislation to make child care affordable” and, if so, what “specific piece of legislation” he planned to champion. His response was rambling and incomprehensible. (CNN’s Zach Wolf tried his best to make sense of it.)

Perhaps worse, it was not an aberration.

Trump has for many years spoken in a digressive, unwieldy vernacular. But the digressions have become more frequent and the unwieldiness increasingly difficult to square. Given the manner of Biden’s election exit, it seems likely that the former president’s own words will come under greater scrutiny this time out.

The other half of the equation deals with what Trump says when he is, at least in form, speaking clearly.

He has already accused Harris, a Howard University graduate and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, of deciding to “turn Black” for political reasons. Trump’s allies are fond of dismissing Harris as a “diversity” hire.

Though similar lines might rile up his MAGA base, they play poorly in the suburbs – home to the vast majority of undecided voters – and stiffen the backs (and further open the wallets) of Democrats.

For her part, Harris has strained to avoid talk about the “historical nature” of her run, figuring that is self-evident, and in her recent interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, she bypassed a chance to respond to Trump’s bizarre charge.

“Same old, tired playbook,” Harris said. “Next question, please.”

Welcome to closed mic night!

There is a strong case to be made that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden on the night of their first debate.

Belligerent, boisterous and, the country learned shortly thereafter, battling a Covid-19 infection, Trump offered an unflattering parody of himself. Their contest was, of course, close in the end. But no one would deny – well, almost no one – that Trump hurt his chances that night.

History in mind, his campaign and Biden’s agreed before their June debate to mute the candidates’ respective microphones when the other was speaking. Trump literally could not interrupt Biden. As it turned out, he had no reason to – the president interrupted himself over and over, often trailing off at the end of his allotted time. Trump, with a few exceptions, did the politically wise thing and let Biden’s words hang in the air.

Though she stumbled occasionally on crowded stages during the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Harris is generally regarded as a sharper debater than even a full-strength Biden. Her campaign’s push to reopen the microphones, ultimately abandoned shortly before the debate date was set, underscored its desire to give Trump the freedom to implode.

The interplay between Harris and Trump will be more strictly regulated Tuesday night. How apparent that will be to viewers is something to keep an eye on.

Remember Joe Biden?

By the end of Tuesday night’s debate, the better question might be: Are we sure Biden isn’t still running?

A little more than eight weeks since the president left the race, and with precisely eight weeks until the election, Trump’s most consistent argument has been that Harris, for all her talk of turning the page, offers more of the same.

When Harris sticks by Biden’s policies, Trump attacks them and her as a failure. How she tries to parry his expected jabs on immigration and the US-Mexico border will be instructive. When Harris seeks to separate herself from her boss, in manner or practice, Trump asks why she didn’t do more over the past four years.

For Trump, it’s a simple recipe. Harris has a more complex and – if she manages it successfully – nuanced assignment.

What’s not up for debate is that Biden, though absent in person, figures to be a prominent figure on the debate stage. Harris and Trump will use, or try to obscure, his record in service of their own cases – a balancing act that, should one veer too far from the center of political gravity, risks a tumble.

Trump to face cross-examination of his abortion record – and plans

Trump has at times boasted of appointing three of the six Supreme Court Justices who voted in 2022 to gut Roe v. Wade, ending federal protections for abortion. “I’m proud to have done it,” he once proclaimed.

Since then, most Republican-controlled states have imposed either bans or restrictive new laws on the procedure. Some of those efforts were beaten back or overturned by ballot measures organized by abortion rights activists – results that, along with lopsided polling, underscore the unpopularity of the decision and its consequences.

Trump was already out of the White House when the high court’s decision came down. Though he did not personally feel the backlash, his party did, most notably underperforming expectations in the 2022 midterms as Democrats railed against the ruling and some Republicans’ determination to implement a broader federal ban.

The former president himself has offered a variety of positions and takes on the issue, the most consistent being that abortion policy should be determined by the states. Asked what state policies he supports, Trump has failed to deliver a clear answer.

Most recently, he announced he would vote against protecting abortion rights in his adopted home state of Florida, where a ballot measure would wipe out the state’s six-week ban, which Trump also says he opposes.

Harris, the former prosecutor, will try to make her rival stake out a clear position.

How does Harris address the war in Gaza?

Russian forces have been in Ukraine for more than two-and-a-half years. The fighting has been brutal, recalling the eastern front during World War II. Hamas’ deadly October 7, 2023, raid inside Israel set off a now 11-month-old bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza by the Israeli military.

Neither conflict appears near a close as the death tolls grow and the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens.

To hear it from Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin – with whom he claims to have a special friendship – would have never invaded Ukraine if the former president was still in charge, while Israel would be given even freer reign in Gaza than it has enjoyed with Biden in the White House.

Because of the diverse, fragile Democratic coalition that she needs to keep onside, Harris, who unreservedly supports continued Western aid to Ukraine, has been less clear on her Middle East plan.

Both in her convention speech and on the newly minted “issues” page on her campaign website, Harris has made the case for Israel’s defense, along with the creation of a neighboring Palestinian state, and security for both. Critics say she is cutting the proverbial baby in half.

For the first time, though, she will deliver that rhetoric with Trump lying in wait."
politics,US imposes new sanctions on Iran’s main airline over Tehran supplying missiles to Russia,2024-09-10,"Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler","The United States imposed new sanctions on Iran’s main airline as three key European allies announced they will move to do the same in response to Tehran’s transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken previewed the move to impose sanctions on Iran Air earlier Tuesday calling Iran’s supply of the missiles to Moscow “a dramatic escalation.”

The foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and Germany on Tuesday jointly called the missile transfer “a direct threat to European security.”

In addition to moving towards sanctions, they also said their countries “will be taking immediate steps to cancel bilateral air services agreements with Iran.” That move will restrict Iran Air’s ability to fly into Europe and the UK.

“The E3 has privately and publicly been clear that we would take new and significant measures against Iran if the transfers took place,” they said in a joint statement, using “E3” in reference to their trio of countries.

Tuesday is not the first time the US has imposed sanctions on Iran Air and it is unclear whether the latest punitive measures will actually serve to deter Tehran. Still, the joint actions are intended to send a sharp rebuke of Iran’s ongoing support of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Beyond the additional sanctions on Iran Air, the US also imposed sanctions on Russian and Iranian officials and companies involved in the weapons transfers. They also identified “four vessels as blocked property that are enabling Iran’s delivery of weapons components and weapons systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and close-range ballistic missiles (CRBMs), to Russia,” the Treasury Department said in a press release Tuesday.

Blinken said in a press conference earlier Tuesday that “in recent days” the US has “been sharing intelligence behind these findings, with our allies and partners and working together to ensure that there will be significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions.”

“Anyone who proves assistance to Russia … is perpetuating the war, is perpetuating the conflict,” he added, noting that “we’ve warned Tehran publicly, we’ve warned Tehran privately, that taking this step would constitute a dramatic escalation.”

“Dozens of Russian military personnel have been trained in Iran to use the FATH-360 close-range ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 75 miles. Russia has now received shipments of these ballistic missiles and will likely use them within weeks in Ukraine,” Blinken said alongside his British counterpart, David Lammy. Blinken said he expected Russia would begin using the missiles against Ukraine in the coming weeks.

Blinken explained that Iranian missiles will give Russia an “additional capability” and “additional flexibility,” explaining that Russia will now be able to use their own arsenal to hit targets beyond the front lines while they use the short-range ballistic missiles from Iran to hit closer targets.

Iran has already provided Russia with hundreds of drones that Russian forces have used in their war against Ukraine, and Russia has been building a drone-manufacturing facility in country with Iran’s help, CNN has reported. Iran has also trained Russia on how to use the drones.

“It adds to their capacity, and it fuels the war,” Blinken said of the new Iranian missiles Russia now has. “Anyone who is providing assistance to Russia, whether it’s direct lethal assistance like Iran or North Korea, whether it’s assistance to their defense industrial base, like China, is perpetuating the war, is fueling the conflict.”

In return for the new missiles, Russia will provide Iran with technology “including on nuclear issues, as well as some space information,” Blinken said. He called the relationship a “two-way street.”

“As Iran’s destabilizing activity spread, so does Russia, sowing even greater insecurity in their regions and around the world. In recent days, we’ve been sharing intelligence behind these findings, with our allies and partners and working together to ensure that there will be significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions,” Blinken said.

The new sanctions include additional measures on Iran Air, the national airline, Blinken said. “Anyone who proves assistance to Russia … is perpetuating the war, is perpetuating the conflict,” he added.

Lammy similarly called Iran’s actions “a troubling pattern” and “a significant escalation.”

Blinken and Lammy said they would make a joint visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, later this week. Lammy described it as the “first joint visit of this kind for well over a decade.”

CNN previously reported that the shipment of the Iranian missiles had arrived in Russia. Iranian officials have denied that they sent missiles to Russia.

politics,Tuberville puts hold on military promotion for top Austin aide,2024-09-09,"Lauren Fox, Jack Forrest","Sen. Tommy Tuberville has placed a hold on the promotion of Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark, a top aide to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican confirmed to CNN.

“Sen. Tuberville has concerns about Lt. Gen. Clark’s actions during Secretary Austin’s hospitalization,” Tuberville spokesperson Mallory Jaspers told CNN. “Lt. Gen. Clark knew that Sec. Austin was incapacitated and did not tell the Commander in Chief. As a senior commissioned officer, Lt. Gen. Clark’s oath requires him to notify POTUS when the chain of command is compromised.”

The move, however, is very different from when Tuberville last year issued a blanket hold on military promotions across the board unless the Pentagon changed its abortion policy. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that this nomination now on the floor could still be resolved with procedural motions and is just one instead of hundreds from last year.

The release of a report from the Pentagon’s inspector general could also impact the future and speed of the confirmation. The review was launched earlier this year to review whether the Pentagon has the appropriate policies in place to ensure an effective transfer of power and duties following Austin’s hospitalizations that were not immediately disclosed to the White House or other senior national security officials.

Jaspers said the senator is “waiting to see the forthcoming IG report.”

The Washington Post first reported on the hold.

James Adams, a Pentagon spokesman, told CNN that Clark is “highly qualified” for the job and “was nominated for this critical position because of his experience and strategic expertise,” including his previous roles as commander of US Army Central, the Army’s 25th Infantry Division, and chief of staff for US Army Pacific.

“We urge the Senate to confirm all of our qualified nominees,” Adams said. “These holds undermine our military readiness.”

Austin was hospitalized on January 1 for complications from a prostate cancer procedure in December. The Pentagon did not notify the media until January 5 and despite the seriousness of his hospitalization, it was later revealed that Austin had not notified Congress or the White House about his diagnosis, initial procedure or subsequent complications and hospitalization.

The failure to notify administration officials kicked off a firestorm on Capitol Hill and Austin was grilled by members of Congress during a February hearing focused on his dayslong delay notifying both lawmakers and President Joe Biden about his whereabouts — with Republicans particularly eager to turn up the heat on Austin.

Austin announced in a statement in July that Biden had nominated Clark, who is currently serving as the senior military assistant to Austin, for appointment as commanding general of US Army Pacific.

Now that the nomination is on the floor, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer could hold an up-or-down vote and burn time to confirm the nominee as Tuberville can’t hold it up forever on his own.

Tuberville faced bipartisan pressure last year for several months to cease his blanket hold on military promotions that started last March and delayed the confirmations of more than 450 top military nominees. Top military leaders, including Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told CNN at the time that the holds were aiding US adversaries.

Tuberville had maintained that he wanted the Pentagon to scrap its post-Roe v. Wade policy providing reimbursements for service personnel who travel out of state for reproductive services, including abortions.

He eventually released the bulk of his holds late last year, allowing hundreds of military nominations to be confirmed.

politics,Andrew Cuomo to testify before House panel on pandemic response,2024-09-10,"Clare Foran, Gloria Pazmino","Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is set to testify publicly before a GOP-led House panel on Tuesday where he is expected to face questions over his handling of the pandemic during his time in office and Covid-era nursing home policy in the state.

The public hearing will offer a high-profile opportunity for Republicans to grill the former governor after he testified in June behind closed doors before members of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been out of office for several years, and it is unclear what new information may emerge from the testimony. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified on the pandemic at a contentious public hearing before the same subcommittee in June.

Cuomo was in the national spotlight early in the outbreak for his daily coronavirus briefings and passionate pleas for more medical equipment from the federal government, but later became a focus of controversy over deaths in nursing homes. The former governor has defended his handling of the pandemic, saying that the state followed federal guidelines.

A spokesperson for Cuomo has confirmed that the former governor will testify.

“The one question that needs to be answered is still being ignored: ‘Why did more people die from COVID in the United States than any other country and how do we make sure it never happens again?’ It is Governor Cuomo’s pleasure to join the committee once again to try to get an answer,” said Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesperson.

New York state’s handling of nursing homes and their residents during the pandemic has been a subject of scrutiny, particularly after the state health department issued a controversial advisory on March 25, 2020, relating to hospital discharges and nursing home admissions.

The advisory stated that residents must not be denied admission to nursing homes “solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19” and that nursing homes “are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission.”

In May 2020, Cuomo announced an executive order requiring patients to test negative for Covid-19 before being discharged from a hospital to a nursing home.

Cuomo has said that New York followed federal guidelines when sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes and that the advisory was consistent with guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Ahead of Tuesday’s hearing, Republicans on the House panel released a 48-page memo stating that Cuomo was “involved in the decision that led to the March 25 Directive.”

The memo further states that the directive “was not consistent with applicable federal guidance regarding hospital to nursing home transfers and COVID-19 related infection control” and that the policy ultimately had “predictable but disastrous consequences.”

The memo also accuses the Cuomo administration of manipulating data, which concealed the magnitude of nursing home deaths, and claims that top advisers to the governor influenced a report by the Department of Health in order to shift the blame for the deaths of nursing home residents.

As part of its investigation, the subcommittee interviewed Cuomo and approximately 10 aides in addition to reviewing more than 550,000 pages of documents.

Azzopardi, the Cuomo spokesperson, said in a statement, “This MAGA Congressional Committee came up short on verifying the Big Lie they’ve been peddling for years: Its report does not conclude there was any causality between the March 25th DOH guidance and deaths in nursing homes.” The statement says that the claim of Cuomo’s involvement with the guidance “not only wasn’t supported by the testimony they cited,” but is “directly contradicted” by testimony from a former health department official.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James issued a report in 2021 finding that the New York State Department of Health undercounted Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents by approximately 50%. The New York health department undercounted the number of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes by thousands during Cuomo’s time in office, an audit conducted by state officials found in 2022.

Critics have argued that counting only residents who died inside nursing homes while excluding residents who died in hospitals led to a much lower count of nursing home deaths, which helped Cuomo portray New York as having a better response to the pandemic than other parts of the country.

“Andrew Cuomo owes answers to the 15,000 families who lost loved ones in New York’s nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee and is also a doctor, said in a statement announcing that Cuomo would appear publicly before the panel. “On September 10, Americans will have the opportunity to hear directly from the former governor about New York’s potentially fatal nursing home policies.”

Azzopardi said in the statement that the report shows that “out-of-facility nursing home tabulations were initially withheld due to legitimate concerns over accuracy.”

Cuomo has been investigated by the Department of Justice, Manhattan district attorney, New York attorney general and the New York State Assembly, none of which brought charges for his handling of the pandemic.

A release from the committee announcing the memo further states that current New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, “has not been cooperative” with document and information requests, and the panel is “considering next steps,” including “potentially issuing a subpoena.”

The memo states that the New York State Executive Chamber did not produce documents until February 2024, which it says was “more than eight months after the original request,” but notes that the panel “has since received three separate productions amounting to 373,999 documents.”

Cuomo was first elected governor in 2010 and served nearly three full terms before he resigned in August 2021 following the release of a report by James’ office that found he had sexually harassed multiple women. Cuomo has denied the allegations.

politics,"Former Project 2025 director downplays Trump ties, but says he hopes he’d implement the plan",2024-09-09,Aaron Pellish,"Paul Dans, the former director of the group behind the conservative policy roadmap Project 2025, said on Monday he’s not worried about Vice President Kamala Harris invoking the proposal against Donald Trump in Tuesday’s debate and said he’d like to see the former president implement the plan if he’s returned to the White House.

Dans told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in his first TV interview since stepping down as director in late July that the former president “had nothing to do with” the Heritage Foundation-backed policy playbook forged by dozens of different organizations.

But Dans, the former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management under Trump, said he’s been to the former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort on “several” occasions and has met with Trump campaign leadership “from time to time.” He said he’d “shaken hands” with Trump, most recently at a Christian media convention in Tennessee where the former president spoke in February.

His comments come as Harris and her allies have sought to link Trump to Project 2025 to portray him as extreme. Democrats have repeatedly pointed to the set of conservative policies as Trump’s and the Republican Party’s roadmap if they return to the White House and control Congress, often highlighting proposals on reproductive health care, prescription drug costs and education policy. The vice president often references to the plan to suggest Trump wants to take the country “back to the past,” while insisting to supporters, “We are not going back.”

Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement with Project 2025, saying on Truth Social earlier this year that “some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” But at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found earlier this year, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch.

Dans said Trump himself was not involved in crafting the proposal and said the number of former Trump administration employees contributing to the project was an example of “natural” coordination between former colleagues.

“(Trump) personally didn’t have anything to do with it. Certainly, a lot of folks, you know, worked on it, came out of the Trump administration. But that’s natural for any Republican administration. You’re going to have the carry over for the next one,” he said.

Asked about Trump’s criticism of the plan, Dans said he didn’t know what the former president was specifically referring to.

“It was really a coming together of the conservative movement,” Dans said at another point. “Our side’s always been prone to infighting, and what we were able to do here was bring together 110 groups and really lay out a common sense plan.”

When asked about his decision to step down as the group’s director – which Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita welcomed with a statement warning groups like Project 2025 not to “misrepresent their influence with President Trump” or “it will not end well for you” – Dans again denied any ties with the Trump campaign but did not respond directly to LaCivita’s warning.

“With apologies to Mark Twain, I’d say, you know, the reports about my demise have been greatly exaggerated,” he said.

In an interview with The New York Times published Monday, Dans blamed campaign advisers LaCivita and Susie Wiles for their handling of Trump’s campaign in the past few months as Democrats pivoted to supporting Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

“Trump should be running like Secretariat at the Belmont, but instead it’s a race to the wire,” Dans told the Times.

Asked by CNN whether he thought Trump’s campaign managers are doing a good job, he told Collins, “I’m excited about the change,” alluding to high-profile additions to Trump’s team, including 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson."
politics,"RFK Jr.’s name to be removed from North Carolina ballots, state Supreme Court rules",2024-09-09,"Dianne Gallagher, Ethan Cohen","Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will be removed from the North Carolina ballot, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday.

In a 4-3 decision, with both of the Democratic members and one Republican dissenting, the GOP-controlled court wrote that having accurate ballots is more important than the costs and delays that will come from having to reprint the state’s ballots.

Absentee ballots in North Carolina were supposed to start going out on Friday but were held amid the legal fight over Kennedy’s removal after he dropped his independent bid for president. According to the state board of elections, absentee voting could now be delayed nearly two weeks while ballots are reprinted.

“We acknowledge that expediting the process of printing new ballots will require considerable time and effort by our election officials and significant expense to the State,” the majority wrote. “But that is a price the North Carolina Constitution expects us to incur to protect voters’ fundamental right to vote their conscience and have that vote count.”

In guidance to county election boards Monday evening, state board executive director Karen Brinson Bell said that the process of reprinting ballots without Kennedy’s name would continue, and that existing ballots “must be strictly separated and moved to storage to avoid any accidental usage in this election.”

Brinson Bell wrote that counties should not mail out ballots until a uniform date can be set. “We will continue to consult with counties and ballot vendors to determine the feasible start date for distributing absentee ballots statewide,” Brinson Bell wrote.

Under federal law, ballots for overseas and military voters must start going out by September 21, but Brinson Bell wrote that the state board has “already begun discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to seek a potential waiver of that deadline”

Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump, but the Democratic-controlled state board of elections voted along party lines to reject Kennedy’s request to remove his name from the ballot, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.

Kennedy challenged the decision, and a lower court judge sided with the state board on Thursday but gave Kennedy 24 hours to appeal. Friday morning, an appeals court overturned that decision and ordered officials to remove Kennedy’s name from the ballot, which led to the state board asking the state Supreme Court to intervene.

In its decision, the court blamed the state board for the predicament, writing “any harm suffered” by the board because of the order to redo the ballots “is of their own making.”

The court criticized the board for continuing to prepare ballots even after Kennedy announced that he was suspending his candidacy on August 23.

Brinson Bell responded to the court in her note to the counties, writing, “by the time Kennedy’s campaign got a message to the State Board asking about the process to withdraw the evening of August 26, more than half of counties had started printing ballots and, at that point, it would have been impossible to reprint and meet the 60-day deadline” for ballots to start going out.

Counties will be responsible for the costs of reprinting the ballots, which Brinson Bell acknowledged in her note. “We know the hardship this imposes on you and your counties, and we deeply regret that.”

Democratic Justice Allison Riggs criticized both the appeals court and Kennedy in a blistering dissent.

“The magnitude of the harm wrought by the Court of Appeals’ order, both to voters of the state who have been guaranteed by their elected legislature sixty days in which to receive and cast absentee ballots and to the overworked and underpaid public servants working as election administrators in a time when such service has subjected those public servants to harassment and peril… is egregious and unjustified,” Riggs wrote.

Riggs accused Kennedy of wanting to “have his cake and eat it, too.”

“Forcing the state to put his name on the ballot, creating for the state costs both practical and legal, he now wants to reprint millions of ballots because he has decided to suspend his campaign without actually ending it or foreclosing the possibility of his election,” Riggs wrote.

The decision to remove Kennedy from the ballot came the day as the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that his name must remain on the state’s ballot. Kennedy is also challenging the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s decision to keep him on the ballot in that Midwestern battleground.

Since endorsing Trump, Kennedy has sought to withdraw his name from the ballot in competitive states in order to boost the former president’s chances of winning there.

Initially, Kennedy said that his supporters in states seen as safe for either major party should still vote for him. However, he reversed that position in a fundraising message last week, telling his supporters to back Trump “no matter what state you live in.”

politics,Harris braces for the most critical moment of her political career at debate with Trump,2024-09-10,Stephen Collinson,"Kamala Harris’ joyful campaign will Tuesday be hit by the blunt force of reality — a debate with Donald Trump — the most menacing political foe of modern times.

The vice president transformed the 2024 election after President Joe Biden’s abject debate showing against Trump on CNN in June led him to end his reelection bid. She restored several swing states to the electoral battlefield and has had Democrats dreaming of a stunning turnabout in a race most thought they were well on the way to losing.

Yet her success in unifying her party, branding herself as a fresh voice of generational change and closing into a dead heat with Trump in polling has so far not cemented a reliable path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Indeed, if the election were on Tuesday, the ex-president, who has already defied an assassination attempt and scores of criminal charges, could still win.

Presidential debates usually don’t decide elections — notwithstanding the cataclysmic impact of Biden’s wipeout. But Tuesday night represents the best remaining chance for Harris to drive home a decisive argument that could thwart Trump’s historic comeback.

Her assignment in Philadelphia will require the use of rhetorical skills that have been often questioned in an uneven vice presidency. While she has had her moments in debates and Senate hearings, Harris has sometimes struggled to articulate clear policies and answers under pressure in spontaneous situations. Her willingness to submit to only one major media interview since becoming the Democratic nominee, on CNN last month, has only raised the bar for her performance in what is so far the only scheduled debate with Trump. And while the former president has now taken part in presidential debates in three separate elections, this will be Harris’ first venture onto the debate stage since her meeting with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020.

A stunning contrast will be visible on stage

As she seeks to become the first Black woman and South Asian president, Harris will come into close quarters for the first time with a rival who will do anything to win and who has a history of using racial and gendered tropes for political gain. Trump has questioned her intelligence and race as a Black woman and has amplified a sexual innuendo about her on social media. But the vice president seems determined not to be drawn into his traps. She refused in her CNN interview to address Trump’s race-based rhetoric, dismissing it as the “same old, tired playbook” and adding, “Next question, please.”

Harris has far less top-level political experience than either 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or Biden when they confronted Trump in presidential debates. And even some members of her own party didn’t believe that she was the strongest potential Democratic leader for a post-Biden era.

But on Tuesday, Harris has a chance to change perceptions about her political acumen and to put down a marker for the sprint to November 5.

A campaign that has been about avoiding error and limiting unscripted public exposure for the vice president faces a nowhere-to-hide moment on prime-time television. And the price of failure is enormous — as it could put a strongman ex-president, who tried to subvert US democracy after the 2020 election, on the road to a new presidency devoted to “retribution.” The stakes for Democrats were emphasized on Saturday when Trump vowed in a social media post to prosecute and jail election officials, political opponents, donors and others who he suggests will have “cheated” in the election, as he made yet more untrue accusations that his 2020 loss was the result of voter fraud.

How Harris could win

Still, if Harris can withstand the pressure and stare down the onslaught from Trump, the debate offers her significant opportunities — potentially more than those open to Trump, who’s already a love-him-or-hate-him known quantity.

A successful performance on Tuesday night could establish a platform for the vice president to convince undecided voters in critical swing states that she has credible plans to improve their lives. A New York Times/Siena College poll released this weekend hinted at the possibilities for her to grow, finding that 28% of likely voters wanted to learn more about the vice president, whereas only 9% thought the same of the Republican nominee.

Harris has clearly been thinking about how to win over those voters. She has, for example, shown more concern for their economic challenges than Biden, whose defensive statements on the unevenness of the post-pandemic recovery became a liability. Harris has vowed to crack down on what she says is “price gouging” on groceries, says she wants to help first-time home buyers with up to $25,000 in downpayment support and wants to make rent more affordable.

And in a broader sense, she is offering voters a chance to avoid the chaos, bitterness and political turbulence that raged in Trump’s first term and that his increasingly wild statements suggest would only intensify in a second.

Haris will be ‘fully prepared’

But to succeed in the debate, the vice president faces three difficult tasks.

— She must find a balance between rebutting what her campaign expects to be a gusher of attacks and falsehoods from Trump and emphasizing her message. “I think he’s going to lie and he has a playbook that he has used in the past, be it, you know, his attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton,” Harris said in a radio interview on “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show” released on Monday. “What I intend to point out is what we – so many people – know, and certainly, as I’m traveling the country in this campaign, he tends to fight for himself, not for the American people.”

— Harris must also neutralize the underlying contradiction of her campaign — that she’s running as an agent of change and renewal despite being part of an unpopular administration that Trump blames for many of the problems that she is promising to fix, including high prices for groceries and housing.

In a related challenge, Harris must try to make up ground on Biden on two issues that voters say are most important to them and on which she usually trails Trump in polls: management of the economy and immigration. Trump has struggled to make effective arguments against Harris since she joined the race, but in its searing advertising campaigns, his team has accused her and Biden of causing the economic issues hurting the middle class. As Trump’s team put it in a memo on Monday, “As the chief cheerleader for Bidenomics, she needs to convince voters how Bidenomics is working despite everything being significantly more expensive than under President Trump.”

— Harris will also need to find a way to parry Trump’s certain accusations that she has flip flopped on policies that she backed during her short-lived Democratic primary run in 2019, including on fracking and the border. In seeking to explain these shifts in the CNN interview, Harris told Dana Bash that while she may have modified her approaches, her “values have not changed.” She argued, for instance, that she now believed it was possible to fight the climate crisis without banning the environmentally damaging practice of fracking, seeking to finesse her position on an issue that could hurt her in battleground Pennsylvania. The conceit, however, allowed the Trump campaign to argue she’d return to her original stance if she won power.

The former president’s team has made no attempt to hide its disdain for Harris’ political skills and clearly believes that her performance will come closer to her stumbles early in her vice presidency than her assured, but scripted, showing at the Democratic convention. Trump, for instance, insisted last week, “I’m going to let her talk.”

That was among the milder rhetoric the former president has aimed at Harris as he’s tried to further raise the heat on his rival. But Anita Dunn, a former senior Biden adviser who helped prepare the president for the June debate, said the new Democratic nominee would be ready for anything Trump throws at her.

“He will say anything – that is actually the hurdle – not to go down those rabbit holes,” Dunn told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “He will say anything – it may not make sense; it may be totally incoherent, but he will say it with a lot of authority. And so, making sure you know what your game plan is, what you want to say to the American people, is key,” Dunn added.

“I believe the vice president will be fully prepared to do that.”"

politics,Why playing it safe on immigration and crime could be a big risk for Harris,2024-09-09,Ronald Brownstein,"Vice President Kamala Harris has so far largely avoided confronting Donald Trump on some of his most racially inflammatory policy proposals – even as she continues to underperform among the Hispanic and Black voters who could face the harshest consequences from the former president’s plans.

Not calling out his ideas for the mass deportation of undocumented migrants, for example, or the pressure he wants to put on local governments to adopt tougher policing tactics is a cautious strategy that may reflect the unease in some Democratic circles about bringing attention to the volatile issues of immigration and crime. But it could also deny her some of her best potential tools to pry back some of the Black and Hispanic voters among whom most polls show Trump is still running better than in 2020.

Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump has constantly attempted to portray her as weak on immigration and crime. The former California attorney general has sought to rebut those charges by emphasizing her toughness on those questions – especially her prosecutorial background in a border state – and highlighting Trump’s torpedoing of a bipartisan border deal. But the real question for many of the groups working on these issues is whether she tries to turn the tables by portraying Trump’s solutions to these problems as extreme, impractical and racially divisive.

Gary Segura, a pollster who works with UnidosUS, a leading Hispanic advocacy group that has endorsed Harris, said that the vice president was missing an opportunity by avoiding a confrontation with Trump over his mass deportation plans, for example. “We have done focus groups and polling both for Unidos and for other organizations [and] overwhelmingly mass deportation is not a popular position,” among Hispanics, Segura told reporters last week while releasing a new Unidos national survey of Hispanic voters. “But it is not particularly well known. Many of the people we speak to believe he will do it if he can, but they just don’t actually believe that he can pull that off.”

On both immigration and crime, Trump this year is running on an agenda significantly more aggressive than he proposed either in 2020 or 2016.

In effect, Trump is gambling that he can energize his base of culturally conservative White voters with these hardline ideas, while also attracting an increased share of non-White voters on other issues, starting with the economy. The reluctance of the Harris campaign, and the leading Democratic interest groups, to confront Trump more directly over his proposals is increasing the odds that gamble will pay off.

Among the immigration issues that Harris and liberal groups supporting her have almost completely ignored are Trump’s pledge to implement a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants; his call to end birthright citizenship for the children of those immigrants; and his refusal to rule out reviving his policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border (which his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Friday also suggested could be reprised).

In his Wisconsin campaign rally on Saturday, Trump warned that deporting at least some of the migrants he intends to target “will be a bloody story.”

Democrats have also said little about Trump’s suite of aggressive crime policy proposals. These including mandating that local police departments adopt “stop and frisk” tactics as a condition of receiving federal law enforcement aid, while simultaneously passing federal legislation making it more difficult to sue police officers for misconduct. (He touted those ideas again last Friday when receiving the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police.) Trump has also talked openly about deploying the National Guard into high-crime cities over the objections of local governors and mayors.

These programs’ cumulative impact on minority communities could be enormous. Trump has repeatedly promised to pursue “the Largest Domestic Deportation Operation in History,” as he has phrased it on social media. Stephen Miller, Trump’s top immigration adviser, has publicly discussed plans to build a massive deportation force composed of federal law enforcement officials from a wide array of agencies, local police and sheriff’s departments, and even National Guard troops provided by sympathetic red state governors, to “go around the country arresting illegal immigrants in large-scale raids.” Undocumented migrants, Miller continued, would then be transferred to massive internment camps – “large-scale staging grounds near the border, most likely in Texas” – from which they would returned to their home countries through near-constant flights.

Deportations at even a fraction of the pace Trump is promising could be enormously disruptive to the Hispanic community and the broader economy.

Michael Ettlinger, the founding director of the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy, wrote last week in the Boston Globe that mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could remove from the workforce 22% of all farmworkers, 15% of construction workers, and 8% of both manufacturing and service workers, including child care providers. Economic forecasters at groups such as Moody’s Analytics and Goldman Sachs have cited that potential disruption to the labor force as a key factor in their projections that Trump’s agenda would reignite inflation and slow domestic growth.

Simultaneously, widespread deportations could touch millions of Hispanics beyond those here illegally. According to unpublished new research provided to CNN, Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center, estimates that about 15 million Hispanics, or roughly one-fourth of the entire US Hispanic population, live in so called “mixed status” families, where at least some members are undocumented. Those 15 million people divide roughly equally between those who are here illegally and those who are legal residents – including nearly 4 million US-born citizen children of undocumented parents, Passel calculates.

The implications of Trump’s criminal justice agenda are nearly as sweeping. In one of his “Agenda 47” videos outlining his second-term plans, Trump said he “will require local law enforcement agencies receiving [federal] grants to return to proven policing measures such as stop-and-frisk.” That refers to the policy, instituted most aggressively in New York City under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, of stopping large numbers of people to search for drugs or guns; eventually a federal judge ruled the program violated the rights of minorities, who were disproportionately targeted in the stops, and the city abandoned the policy. Black and Hispanic young men between the ages of 14-24 accounted for over 40% of all those stopped under the policy, even though they account for less than 5% of city residents, according to a report by the NYCLU.

Advocates for police reform say that requiring cities to implement some version of the stop-and-frisk approach while also passing federal legislation strengthening the “qualified immunity,” which protects police against lawsuits over misconduct (as Trump has also promised), would inevitably result in many more arrests of young Black and brown men each year. “If that is something cities take on across the country … there will be millions of [more] police stops,” mostly of younger Black and Latino men, said Ed Chung, vice-president for initiatives of Vera Action, a group that advocates for policing reform. “And if the numbers hold true to what the New York Police Department experienced, 90% of those will be stops for no reason.”

Yet despite these potentially massive impacts, Trump’s immigration and criminal justice ideas have received relatively little attention in the campaign from anyone – the media, liberal interest groups or the Harris campaign.

Harris did not mention the threat of mass deportation in either Phoenix or Las Vegas, two cities with very large Hispanic populations, when she appeared in them on her initial campaign swing with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. And while, in all her stump speeches, she alludes to the prospect that Trump’s proposed tariffs will inflate prices, she pointedly omits any mention of the mass deportation program that economists consider an equal inflationary risk. On Friday, Harris also chose not to mention mass deportation during a radio interview with Univision, when the host asked her to summarize her argument to undecided Hispanic voters. Nor has Harris criticized Trump’s plans to pressure cities to implement tougher policing policies, even when she’s appeared in cities with large Black populations, such as Philadelphia, Atlanta and Savannah.

The Harris campaign, based on my conversations with people familiar with its thinking, has not engaged in these fights largely because it believes that the remaining minority voters up for grabs are mostly motivated by the same economic concerns as the White electorate. It wants Harris to be seen primarily as focusing on those bread-and-butter concerns. To the extent Democrats want to highlight some of Trump’s more extreme ideas, the campaign believes that work could be done more usefully either by surrogates, paid advertising, or groups in the broader Democratic universe – rather than Harris personally engaging the former president, according to the sources familiar with the campaign’s strategy.

Still a growing number of Democratic activists focused on rallying Black and Latino voters are clearly eager to hear Harris and other party leaders challenge the Trump agenda more directly.

“There is a way in which those [crime and immigration] issues in particular are also about bigger things,” said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a group working to mobilize Black voters for Harris and Democrats. “They are about values. There is a way to talk about them that is fundamentally about who are we and who do we want to be as nation, which she is really good at. People are quite tired of being the worst version of ourselves, and I think that contrast is really important to make.”

Segura, the pollster who works with UnidosUS, said that while a measurable segment of the Hispanic electorate supports hardline approaches on immigration they tend to be “the voters who lean in the GOP direction in the first place.” As a result, he added, “I don’t see a lot of risk” for Harris to push back against Trump’s deportation plans “particularly in targeted advertising to Hispanic voters.”

Tom Wong, founding director of the US Immigration Policy Center at the University of California at San Diego, has tested public opinion on mass deportation for another immigration advocacy group, America’s Voice. Wong said that while mass deportation initially draws substantial public backing, support for the idea dwindles both among Hispanics and the broader population when people are informed that such a program could sweep up people who have been in the US for years without breaking the law and may have US citizen children.

“Once we can put a human face on the idea of an undocumented immigrant being rounded up and deported, then the general public takes a step back,” Wong said.

A national poll by Marquette Law School in Wisconsin earlier this year confirmed that dynamic. A May survey found that when part of the sample was asked, “Do you favor or oppose deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally back to their home countries?” over three-fifths said they did. But that support flipped to majority opposition among another group of respondents who were asked if they would support deportations even of people who “have lived here for a number of years, have jobs and no criminal record.”

Raising the prospect of the detention camps that would be required for mass deportation may also depress support for the idea. New polling released last week by the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute found that over three-fifths of all Americans opposed deporting all undocumented immigrants “even if it takes setting up encampments guarded by the US military.” Fully 7-in-10 Hispanics said they opposed that idea, according to unpublished results provided to CNN.

Not as much public polling is available on the specifics of Trump’s policing agenda. But Daniela Gilbert, director of Vera’s Redefining Public Safety initiative, says that the group’s private surveys consistently show widespread public backing for a comprehensive agenda of providing support to police departments, but also insisting on accountability for police misconduct and promoting alternative approaches to community safety, such as greater mental health intervention and drug treatment. That’s largely the mix of policies the Biden administration has advanced, Gilbert noted.

“Our polling data really shows that Harris will leave votes on the table if her campaign is silent on the need for better and more accountable policing,” Gilbert said. “Talking about those policies can garner more support, whether or not that is framed in direct response to Trump’s outlandish policies, or really focused on the track record she has in advocating for greater accountability.”

Anthony Baber, director of communications and culture at Detroit Action, a grassroots group that mobilizes working-class and younger voters of color in that city, points to another reason for Harris to amplify the volume on these issues. He said her emphasis on her prosecutorial background has caused some of the voters of color the group is trying to reach to question the distance between her and Trump on issues relating to criminal justice. Harris, Baber believes, needs to more clearly separate herself from Trump on that front.

“Trump is kind of benefiting from the perception of Harris as the super cop,” Baber said. “I think there’s a lot of people who see [her history as a prosecutor] and wonder if [she] is a more compassionate candidate when it comes to criminal justice reform, because it is not coming through as clearly as a difference between these two candidates.”

Harris nonetheless has plenty of reasons to minimize her exchanges with Trump around immigration and crime. Some Democratic strategists agree with the campaign assessment she has a better chance to reach the non-White voters now considering Trump by emphasizing economic messages rather than the threat he could pose to them on these issues.

Polls also consistently show that many more voters trust Trump than Harris on immigration – he led her by double-digits on the issue in all six of the swing states in CNN’s survey last week. She’s narrowed Biden’s overall deficit to Trump on trust to handle crime. But among White voters, she trailed Trump by at least 22 points on immigration in all of the states CNN polled except Michigan and Wisconsin, where she trailed more narrowly; on crime, she trailed him by at least 17 points with Whites everywhere except those two states, where again she trailed more narrowly.

Given those deficits, some of the activists focused on Black and Hispanic voters believe the party has concluded that any time spent talking about immigration or crime is a net negative for them – even if they are trying to focus attention on Trump’s controversial responses. To the extent Harris and other Democrats are addressing these issues at all, many of these activists believe, they are emphasizing a message of toughness rather than equity. “I think that Democrats have been scared away [from] talking about immigration because of the record numbers of arrivals at the southern border,” said Wong, alluding to the high number of border crossings late last year that fed GOP attacks on the Biden administration but have since markedly decreased. Chung of Vera Action similarly says that the increase in crime around the pandemic – which has since largely receded – has discouraged not only Democratic office-holders but the broader constellation of progressive groups from more forcefully pushing alternatives to hardline policing policies.

Harris has also repeatedly signaled that she does not want to focus the campaign on issues that revolve around race – as she did when she immediately shut down any discussion of Trump’s attempt to question her racial identity during her recent interview with Dana Bash on CNN.

“I think a lot of issues that could be really resonant among historically Democratic constituencies, like younger African Americans and Hispanics, they seem to be worried more about alienating more conservative Whites in places like Pennsylvania,” said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

Against all of these reasons for Harris to sidestep these fights, there remains the stubborn reality that, despite her own gains, she still typically polls below Biden’s 2020 level of support among Hispanic and Black voters. And many of those voters might recoil from these Trump policies on crime and immigration if they heard more about them.

Shropshire of BlackPAC said that in her group’s polling, the hardline approaches to policing and deportation that Trump is touting “do not align with the values of any of the voters that he is trying to move” in the Black community. “What he is hoping is that the Black voters who he is [courting] don’t see that stuff,” Shropshire said.

Like the campaign advisers I spoke with, Shropshire adds, “It should not just be the onus of the vice president to call this out. There is an entire Democratic ecosystem that should be addressing these things.”

Given Harris’ persistent need to recover more ground with Hispanic and Latino voters, the riskiest choice for her and her allies on immigration and crime might be to continue to play it safe."

CNN —

The world knows what kind of a debater former President Donald Trump is: loose with the facts, quick with an insult and confident to the extreme.

But what about Vice President Kamala Harris?

While her 2020 presidential campaign barely registered – she ended her campaign in December 2019, before the first primary votes were cast – Harris did leave a mark in one important way.

On the primary debate stage in June 2019, before she was his running mate or he was anywhere near the White House, Harris eviscerated Joe Biden.

‘That little girl was me’

The issues of policing and race were key to the 2020 Democratic primary.

“I do not believe that you are a racist,” Harris told Biden, staring him down across the debate stage as he looked straight ahead or down at his podium.

But it was hurtful, she said, that Biden would praise men like the late Sens. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and John Stennis of Mississippi, “who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.”

Pivoting, she noted that during his long Senate career, Biden worked with these men on legislation opposed to federally mandated busing in local school districts.

“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,” Harris said. “And that little girl was me.”

It was a powerful moment, evidence of what Harris can do on the debate stage – clearly rehearsed, deployed effectively, unsparing and said to the face of her opponent, who would later elevate her as his running mate.

A chance to prosecute Trump

Harris has, no doubt, spent her debate prep time working on material to use against her rival this year. She and Trump are set to meet for the first time and debate Tuesday night in the key state of Pennsylvania. ABC News is broadcasting the event.

Related: CNN’s political team has this in-depth look at Harris’ prep work at a sort of debate camp in a Pittsburgh hotel compared with Trump’s more informal approach.

Democrats have tried to frame this campaign as one between a former prosecutor in Harris and a convicted felon in Trump. Harris will have to live up to the billing as a tough prosecutor on Tuesday when she gets the rare chance to express Democrats’ years of festering anger with Trump to his face.

Unlike with Biden, Harris won’t have to go back to the 1970s to come up with lines of attack. She can look to his criminal conviction in New York, his liability in a sex abuse and defamation case, his nationalist policies, his unfounded claims about election fraud – for which there is no evidence – or his outrageous pledge to jail election officials.

One speaker at a time

While Harris will have plenty to say about Trump, she won’t have the benefit of his interruptions. The candidates’ mics will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, so Trump will not be able to interrupt Harris with insults like he did with Hillary Clinton, when he told her, “You’re the puppet!” or “You’d be in jail,” during debates in 2016.

It also means Harris’ memorable moment in the 2020 vice presidential debate – when she said in response to Mike Pence interrupting her, “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking” – won’t happen.

Prep can fall flat

Not all of Harris’ planned takedowns work quite as well as the busing attack on Biden. In another 2019 debate, Harris targeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the subject of Warren’s plan to break up tech companies.

Harris tried to isolate that larger issue into something more digestible by expressing disappointment Warren would not call for Twitter (it was a very different company in 2019!) to suspend Trump’s account. Twitter would later suspend Trump’s account after the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, but the company was subsequently bought by Elon Musk and renamed X – and Trump is now active on the platform again.

The point Harris was trying to make felt small and allowed Warren to make a much bigger one.

“Look, I don’t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,” Warren said.

That exchange may be a warning for Harris to avoid getting bogged down in details since Trump won’t – and he will, if history is any guide, happily manufacture facts to make his points.

Lines of attack against Harris

Which brings us to a third telling Harris debate exchange from 2019. She was criticized by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard about her record as a prosecutor, which was to the right of the Democratic Party in 2019. Gabbard argued that Harris was too hard on marijuana offenders and had other criticisms of her time as a prosecutor.

“I am proud of that work,” Harris shot back, arguing she worked as attorney general to make California better, opposed the death penalty and didn’t just “give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body.”

The irony here is that Gabbard, now a former Democrat, has endorsed Trump, who likes to say he would use the death penalty on drug offenders.

Gabbard has reportedly helped Trump with his own debate prep, and Trump will want to paint Harris as to the left of the American mainstream – someone who changed her positions for political expediency in 2019 and has now changed them again to run for president.

The importance of this debate may ultimately be in how those few undecided or movable voters perceive Harris, since perceptions of Trump seem to be set in stone.

In a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Sunday, the race is effectively tied, within the margin of error. Few likely voters – less than 10% – said they feel like they need to learn more about Trump in the poll. More than a quarter, 28%, said they need to learn more about Harris, perhaps suggesting she has more room to grow, or fall, after being given the chance to face off against Trump."
politics,Trump warms up for debate by threatening to jail election officials,2024-09-09,Stephen Collinson,"Donald Trump limbered up for his debate with Kamala Harris by showing the extremism that risks playing into the vice president’s claim that he’s an “unserious man” who is an “extremely serious” threat if he’s returned to the White House.

Trump warned he will jail election officials he considers cheats; is complaining Pennsylvania’s voting is a fraud; vowed to pardon January 6 rioters; railed against women who accused him of sexual misconduct; and spent hours in recent days on sometimes incoherent rants that raised questions about his state of mind.

But new polling ahead of Tuesday’s showdown in Philadelphia shows the race tied up nationally, suggesting Harris’ momentum after replacing President Joe Biden on the ticket hasn’t resulted in a commanding edge.

The tightness of the contest shows both Trump’s enduring appeal to tens of millions of Americans as he seeks a political comeback and the huge task facing Harris as she tries to save an election Democrats seemed doomed to lose before Biden bowed out.

That makes Tuesday’s debate — the first since June’s consequential clash on CNN that eventually ended Biden’s campaign — the most critical scheduled event before Election Day.

Why Harris needs ‘superhuman focus’ in facing Trump

The way each candidate is preparing highlights the different paths Americans can choose in November and the sharp contrast in the style of the presidency that will ensue if Harris or Trump are at the Oval Office desk.

Harris is holed up in Pittsburgh with staff to hone her skills for the test of facing Trump in a debate. Her choice of Pennsylvania for prep stresses the critical importance of a state she almost certainly needs to win to take the presidency. A source told CNN that her advisers are working out how she’ll deal with a rule that a candidate’s mic will be muted while their rival speaks. The vice president had pushed to overturn the restriction in the hope she could use her skills as a former prosecutor to dress down Trump in real time. But she told reporters, “I’m ready,” as she went for a stroll in the Steel City on Sunday with her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reflected on Harris’ challenge as she tries to engage Americans who want to know more about her while dealing with a sometimes-unhinged force of nature like Trump. “It will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate,” Buttigieg said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It’s no ordinary proposition, not because Donald Trump is a master of explaining policy ideas and how they’re going to make people better off. It’s because he’s a master of taking any form or format that is on television and turning it into a show that is all about him.”

A New York Times/Siena College poll published Sunday showed that 28% of likely voters need to know more about Harris, as opposed to just 9% who say the same of her rival. This presents possible room for growth for the vice president. But she is also facing pressure to explain policy reversals on issues such as immigration and fracking while showing more precision than she did in some testy interviews early in her vice presidency. And her unwillingness to submit to major media interviews — apart from one last month on CNN — means that a candidate who has sometimes struggled to articulate coherent arguments in high-pressure and spontaneous situations is coming into the debate without much recent experience of adversarial political combat.

Trump is still struggling to stick to the GOP script

Trump’s Republican supporters have been pleading with him for days to drill down on issues such as the economy, immigration and national security and to avoid petulant behavior that could play into Harris’ argument that it’s time for the country to move on from the bitterness and chaos he represents for many voters. The GOP theory is that Harris, as a key member of an unpopular administration, is ill suited to act as an agent of political change.

But Trump’s conduct heading into the debate explains the concern he will botch the clear contrast spelled out by Sen. Tom Cotton to CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” The Arkansas Republican said Sunday: “People remember that, when Donald Trump was in office, prices were low, wages were high, we had peace and stability around the world.” He added: “Kamala Harris, as vice president, has brought us record high inflation. We have a wide-open southern border and we have war everywhere you turn around in the world.”

Trump, however, was unwilling to restrain himself in recent days.

In the most ominous development, the ex-president on Saturday used his Truth Social network to blast what he called “Cheating and Skullduggery” in 2020 by Democrats, then pivoted to the 2024 election, warning, “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.” He lashed out at “Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials” who he said would be “prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.”

There is no evidence that the 2020 election was corrupt. Trump’s multiple legal challenges were thrown out by judges and even his own attorney general, William Barr, said there was no widespread voter fraud. The fact that the ex-president tried to steal the last election makes his warnings that officials who do not echo his view of this one’s fairness an even more serious issue, and it bodes ill for the post-election period in November if Trump loses.

Trump’s warnings also show the consequences of his successful legal gambits in forestalling accountability for his election interference — in a federal case and in Georgia — until after the coming election. If he regains power, he will almost certainly use his restored presidential authority and new legal maneuvers to dismiss special counsel Jack Smith’s case in Washington, DC, district court and to try to prevent the Georgia one from coming to trial.

In another Truth Social post, Trump picked up on an interview by Tucker Carlson to claim with no evidence that 20% of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are “fraudulent.” This is not the first time that the ex-president has seemed to be preparing a rationale to challenge the 2024 election if he loses.

Trump is not staging mock debates — he’s just venting in public

Trump’s debate prep is the most unorthodox of any modern presidential candidate.

In other public appearances in recent days, the former president has indulged the wilder sides of his character in streams of consciousness that delight many of his supporters but raise questions about whether he has the discipline and clarity of thinking traditionally associated with the presidency.

On Friday, in an extraordinary on-camera appearance in New York, he offered detailed and explicit appraisals of allegations of misconduct against him by women — part of a wider series of claims that he is an innocent victim of the weaponization of justice. His claims seem unlikely to improve his standing among women voters, among whom he trails Harris by 11 points, according to the New York/Times Siena poll.

At a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday, Trump often embarked on confusing digressions — for instance about Al Capone and Hannibal Lecter — and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “chess player.” Trump promised he was the one thing standing between Americans and World War III. And he pledged to pardon people convicted and jailed “by the Harris regime” for trying to overturn the election on January 6, 2021 — a step that would short-circuit the justice system and legal accountability for crimes. In a self-indulgent aside, he praised one of his own speeches as delivered more “brilliantly” than anything since Franklin Roosevelt. His appearance was replete with exaggerations and distortions — although his conspiracy theories and falsehoods come at such a clip that they often escape scrutiny because of their sheer volume.

At one point, Trump mistakenly referred to SpaceX and Tesla pioneer Elon Musk as “Leon.” When Biden made such slips, Trump and allies frequently argued that the president’s mental acuity was in question. But the 78-year-old Trump’s unrestrained public appearances and apparent belief in fantasies and unproven facts also raise questions about his capacity to serve as commander in chief and the threat he poses to constitutional democracy. His grip on the GOP means, however, that he’s driven anyone likely to raise such concerns out of the party — for instance former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who last week endorsed Harris, as did her father, former vice president Dick Cheney.

Trump’s increasingly close relationship with Musk is also offering a preview of a potential second term for the ex-president. His promise to put Musk in charge of an effort to slash government regulations would mean the world’s richest man getting the chance to reshape federal rules and safeguards at a time when his businesses have massive interests that can be influenced by the government. This would create conflict-of-interest controversies that would dwarf those the Republican nominee encountered in his first term.

Despite fresh evidence of Trump’s turbulent character and the success Harris has had so far in improving on Biden’s performance in the race, the latest polling shows no clear leader between them. Harris has an average of 49% support, while Trump has 47% in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which includes surveys conducted between August 23 and September 6. The new average is largely unchanged from before the Democratic National Convention, when Harris was averaging 50% to Trump’s 48% among polls conducted between August 1 and 16."
politics,Voting security: How secure and reliable are US elections?,2024-09-07,Zachary B. Wolf,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

CNN —

With election season underway, you’re bound to hear from former President Donald Trump that an army of undocumented immigrants is trying to vote in the presidential election. You may hear from Democrats that GOP efforts to pass new voting laws is a form of voter suppression.

Despite that rhetoric, you might be surprised to hear the argument that voting in the US — the act of casting a ballot and the guarantee it will be counted — is better now than at any time in the country’s history.

That’s what you’ll get from David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonpartisan and nonprofit group that gets most of its funding from charitable foundations and aims to improve and build confidence in US elections.

I had a long phone conversation with Becker, a former senior attorney in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division who has been working for decades to improve US elections. Our conversation, edited for length, is below:

Actually, voting in the US is better than ever

WOLF: Your first point in talking about US elections is that the system we have is really good and has never been better. Explain that.

BECKER: The fact is, our elections right now — as voters are thinking about whether it’s worthwhile to cast a ballot in this election — our elections right now are as secure, transparent and verifiable as they’ve ever been.

From the security perspective, we have more paper ballots than ever before. Paper ballots are a best practice. They’re auditable, they’re recountable, they’re verifiable by voters, and well over 95% of all voters will be voting on paper in 2024.

We have more audits of those ballots, which confirm the machines work. Those audits are hand counts of ballots to make sure that those counts match what the machine said.

We have more preelection litigation that confirms the rules of the election than ever before. We have better voter lists than ever before, thanks to states having better technology and better data and sharing that data with each other. And then finally, we have more post-election litigation that confirms the results.

We saw that in 2020 where, despite dozens of cases and with additional cases that have been brought in the years afterwards regarding defamation and otherwise, there’s still not been a shred of evidence brought to any court in the country that would indicate that there was a problem with the 2020 election.

So we know the results are accurate.

The other half of that is from the voters’ perspective, it’s easier to participate than ever before. More voters have access to early voting than ever before: 97% of all voters will have the ability to cast an early ballot — everyone except those living in the states of Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire.

Voters in 36 states plus DC will have the ability to vote by mail without any excuse if they want to.

Voters will find, if they want to participate, regardless of who they’re voting for, that it’s going to be an easy process, that they’re going to find it rewarding, that the results will be verifiable. In fact, despite some rhetoric about long lines, evidence suggests almost every voter waits less than 30 minutes in line.

If voters out there are wondering whether to participate, what I’d say is try it, and you’ll see it’s a very easy, convenient, rewarding process.

So why is faith in US elections down?

WOLF: At the same time, polling has shown — and not just in the Trump era, but going back to 2000 — that confidence has fallen, accelerated by Trump, but people have less confidence. If the system is getting better, but people have less faith in it, how can that dynamic be changed?

BECKER: First of all, the data I’ve seen — and I’ve been looking at this since at least 1998 — suggests that there actually has been a radical transformation in voter confidence during the Trump era; that if you looked prior to Trump, what we often saw was that overall voter confidence would remain fairly high, but oftentimes the losing sides’ voters would have less confidence than the winning side.

So in 2004, Republicans were more confident than Democrats. In 2008, it was reversed, but overall it was about the same.

What we’ve seen in the intervening years since Trump has come on the scene is that the constant lies about our election system have had an effect, but only with his hardcore supporters. So a significant percentage of the Republican Party, likely a majority of the Republican Party currently, has serious doubts about the outcomes of elections.

The problem with addressing that, and it’s important to try to address that, is you can’t address it by succumbing to the lies. You have to address the reality of election security and work from there, rather than the fantasy that has been created by losing candidates.

And so we’ve seen places, states actually harm their election integrity by succumbing to lies, doing things like leaving the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, which helps them keep their voter lists up to date.

Several states led by Republicans left that consortium in the last couple of years, and their voter lists are going to be less accurate, which means they’re going to have more problems at the polling place during election season.

Are voters needlessly being culled from voter rolls?

WOLF: We have reported at CNN on efforts to purge or clean voter rolls. There’s been a fair amount of concern raised that people who are legitimately registered will be purged. Are you worried about that?

BECKER: What we call voter list maintenance is a normal aspect of election administration.

Most of the states are required to conduct regular list maintenance under federal law. All states do list maintenance in some ways, and that’s because we as a society are highly mobile. About a third of all American voters will move in a given four-year period of time.

If someone moves out of the state, it’s proper that that voter registration be flagged and ultimately removed because they’re no longer an eligible voter in that state. That’s a normal process that happens in every single state, blue and red.

In general, states do their best to get that right.

I think one of the troubling trends I’m seeing is that hyper-partisans in some states are announcing their normal voter list maintenance … very close to an election, as if it’s something unusual, as if it’s some vast anti-fraud effort to try to take credit for that on a partisan basis and perhaps influence the upcoming election.

A good example of this is in Texas recently … they had undergone three years of list maintenance, removed about a million voters. That’s a very normal number for Texas. There are no red flags that I’ve seen, but that took place over a three-year period, and they just recently announced it as if it was a recent development — and it gives voters the false impression that it’s designed to influence the upcoming election, rather than it was just part of their normal activity.

Is an army of poll watchers coming to disrupt voting?

WOLF: Something else we expect is that Republicans, in particular, are organizing poll watchers in a way that we haven’t seen recently. What are poll watchers, and how do we expect them to be deployed differently this year by the parties?

BECKER: First of all, poll watchers are a normal, constructive aspect of our election system. In every jurisdiction, poll watchers from both parties, from the candidates, from the campaigns, are allowed to watch various parts of the process. Could be voting, could be vote-counting, but they also have to adhere to rules so they don’t interfere with that process.

But when poll watchers might, in this divisive environment, think that they have somehow been deputized as vigilantes in polling places or vote-counting centers, we could have problems.

With regard to this upcoming election, I would say it’s actually not a new thing, that we’ve heard the Republican Party say that they’re going to recruit an army of poll watchers. They have literally said this in almost every presidential election since I’ve been doing this work, and it’s never materialized.

It could be that claims of recruiting an army of poll watchers is an attempt to intimidate some voters. And yet it’s hard to organize watchers at the national level and deploy them all over the country.

I’m skeptical that they will actually be successful in doing so, and even if they are, I am confident that election officials and law enforcement will enforce the laws of the state to make sure that they perform their function, which is to be eyes and ears … but definitely not to interfere with voters.

Americans already prove citizenship in order to vote

WOLF: There are efforts in some states and at the national level to change the way in which people would prove their citizenship in order to register to vote. Why not just do that?

BECKER: We have to understand all of the protections in place to make sure that noncitizens don’t vote in this country.

First, it’s against the law. It has been against the law for decades.

Second, and most people aren’t aware of this, under federal law, every single voter who registers to vote has to provide ID when they register … a driver’s license number or a motor vehicles number. Think about what every person has to provide when they go there for the first time. They have to show proof of legal presence and proof of residence. For most people, that is a US birth certificate or US passport. The state has that information.

Lastly, think about the deterrence effect for noncitizens, whether they’re documented or undocumented, against illegal voting. If they’re undocumented, they might have come here under great risk and great stress for whatever reasons they thought were important. … If they registered to vote or cast a ballot, they would be risking deportation for the right to cast one additional ballot in an election in which 160 million ballots are going to be cast. It would be painting a big bull’s-eye on themselves.

We know that this system that we have in place is effective. States have routinely done checks for noncitizens in just the last couple of years. They found literally zero noncitizens to cast a vote. Even Texas had found only 0.03% possible noncitizens. And based on previous activity in the last few years, it’s likely that every single one of those had been recently naturalized.

So why would we enact a law that’s effectively a “show me your papers” act that basically says to every citizen in the United States, we know you’ve already shown your papers to the DMV. We know you’ve already shown your papers to state agencies, but we’re going to require you to go back out and get your papers again, keep showing them to us.

Another question that I think is legitimately raised about some of the recent claims is the timing. The recent bill that was brought in the House was introduced in the summer of this year, just months before a major presidential election, when, even if it was a good idea, would have been impossible to implement in time for the presidential election.

If this was a serious problem for which there was evidence … why didn’t those who claim that noncitizen voting is a problem bring this up in 2020 or 2021, or even better in 2017, when they had a president in power who is apparently very sympathetic to their views? And the reason is because this is about politics, not policy. … It’s an attempt to set the stage for claims after the election that the election was stolen if their preferred candidate loses.

The argument against making every state vote in the same way

WOLF: This year, it’s Republicans pushing for a national voting law. A couple of years ago, Democrats had a proposal to more normalize the process across the country. I’ve also heard it argued by people like Sen. Mitch McConnell that a very diverse set of voting laws administered at the state level is a feature of the system because it makes it impossible to hack. Do we need to have a better or a more streamlined system? Or do you agree with McConnell that it is not such a bad thing to have 50 different voting systems?

BECKER: Decentralization is a security feature of our system. It is, for all intents and purposes, impossible to steal a national election because we don’t have a national election. We have 10,000 local elections going on at the same time, run by different people of different parties, with redundancies and transparency on different machines that are not connected to the internet.

It is impossible to rig a national election, largely due to the decentralization. It is truly a feature.

It is a feature in another way as well. … We’ve seen great innovations come about, not because Washington decided it was a good idea, but because states wanted to try something new. Online voter registration was started by Arizona in 2002. Widespread mail voting was largely started by Republicans in a lot of the Western states. A lot of really good innovations come out of the states, and some of those innovations ultimately become federal policy later on down the road.

Motor voter — the opportunity, when a citizen is engaged with motor vehicles agencies, to also offer them the opportunity to register to vote.

Statewide voter databases — where instead of having a separate file cabinet in each county or city, each state had a voter registration database, ideally with one record for each voter in the state that followed them as they move.

In some ways, we’ve already achieved standardization — just by best practice, as I mentioned, 47 states have early voting. Only three states are outliers on that. We have 40-plus states that have online voter registration, and we have a few states that are outliers on that. We’re getting there naturally without federal government legislation.

If you ask the election officials out there, the people who actually run elections … almost everyone agrees, for instance, that there should be widespread early voting and no-excuse mail voting. It’s wonderful for voter convenience, but it’s also really important for election security.

Places that seek to concentrate all of their voting activity within a 12- to 14-hour period on a single Tuesday are incredibly vulnerable … to events like traffic or weather or power outages. But if you offer widespread, early in-person and mail voting, if any of those occur during that early period, and even if there’s some kind of cyber event or cyberattack, election officials can be resilient against that, and voters can still come back another day.

Election workers feel like they’re under siege

WOLF: We’ve done stories on those professionals and more importantly, maybe, the volunteers who make elections happen and that these people are being targeted for abuse. How big is that problem?

BECKER: It’s a very big problem. It’s something I’ve seen continue now for well over four years.

I work extensively with election officials — both parties, all over the country — and they are exhausted. They are isolated. They are constantly under threat, not just to themselves, but also their families. They have difficulty going out in public sometimes in some of their counties. They will get accosted while they’re shopping for groceries or even while they’re at their places of worship.

And this is happening at least as much in deeply red counties as anywhere else. It is often the Republican election officials who are getting it the worst in counties that have voted heavily Republican in the past.

It’s something that I find deeply offensive. The election officials of our country, these public servants — who are largely anonymous, who don’t get rich, who don’t get famous — somehow managed the highest turnout in American history with inadequate resources in the middle of a global pandemic, and their work withstood more scrutiny than any election in world history. And instead of throwing them a parade like we should have, they have been pounded and harassed constantly.

In 2021, my nonprofit at the Center for Election Innovation & Research started the Election Official Legal Defense Network in response to this, chaired by former (George W.) Bush and (Mitt) Romney counsel Ben Ginsberg and former (Barack) Obama counsel Bob Bauer.

We have recruited a network of attorneys that we pair with election officials who need legal assistance when they have a problem — and the problems most often look like they’re getting harassed by their own county boards or their own county council or their own county law enforcement, and they need some kind of representation and advice, someone who will actually represent their best interests.

We find them a lawyer and pair them, and those lawyers work for them pro bono to help them through that. I’m very proud that my nonprofit can offer that service. But I’m also saddened by the fact that we live in a country where a nonprofit needs to provide basic legal services to these somewhat anonymous public servants because of the harassment they’re experiencing. I can’t wait for the day when we can sunset this effort and no longer need this kind of assistance to election officials.

I’ll also add that as we sit here today, almost exactly three years since we founded EOLDN, the requests for legal services have been steady and are currently increasing after four years.

WOLF: Related to the last election?

BECKER: The harassment might relate to the last election, might be fueled by false claims about the last election, but the harassment is happening now. It affects them now as they’re preparing for the next major election.

Is the US system still stronger than a sore loser contesting the outcome?

WOLF: We can assume that Trump is going to say there’s fraud in the election, because he did it when he won in 2016 and he did it when he lost in 2020. The electoral count system was changed after the last presidential election. Is there any concern about contesting an election, or is the system just simply strong enough to withstand challenges?

BECKER: So we have to define what we’re worried about here. If we’re worried about whether the system is strong enough to prevent a losing candidate from somehow seizing power against the will of the voters, I am 100% confident that our system is strong enough.

I am 100% confident that the winner of the election, the actual winner, will have their hand on the Bible on January 20.

However, I’m very concerned that in the period of time between November 5 and January 20, a losing candidate and his supporters might very well incite anger and division and violence in a desperate and pathetic attempt to seize power. It’s not going to work. It’s a bad strategy, but we’ve already seen with Donald Trump that he has no qualms about making false claims about elections he’s lost.

It is a near-certainty that regardless of what happens in the 2024 election, he will claim victory on election night. It is a virtual certainty that if he loses the election, or if he perceives he’s losing the election, he will continue to spread lies that we’ve already heard about noncitizens voting or voting machines being rigged — and probably a lot of stuff that’s new and irrational, like we heard in 2020 about Italian satellites and German servers and bamboo ballots and dead Venezuelan dictators.

That will not succeed in court. As before, they will have no evidence, because our system is secure, it’s transparent.

But they will spread lies on social media, and there are activists who have been recruited over the course of the past four years in hundreds of counties all over the country, many of them deeply red counties, who are ready to interfere with the process, to protest at vote-counting centers, to harass and photograph and dox election workers, to threaten election workers, to interfere with facilities and potentially with ballots, to potentially get violent.

Even though these efforts will fail, it could create a lot of volatility and danger for these public servants who are performing an essential duty in our democracy. And I do worry about that quite a bit.

It will be incumbent upon members of the losing party’s political leadership to speak very clearly about this.

While we know what Donald Trump, as the candidate himself, will do, because he’s shown it time and time again, and while I don’t expect, if Trump wins, that Vice President (Kamala) Harris will do the same — I think it is likely that, given there are Republican election officials in some states like Georgia trying to … make it easier to challenge the ministerial certification of results. They’re literally handing weapons to rogue members of the Democratic Party who may seek to delay or stop certification, and how that could fuel anger amongst opponents of Donald Trump.

This doesn’t benefit anybody, and so it’s really important that while the primary threat comes from Donald Trump and from his supporters like Elon Musk, who are spreading disinformation constantly and don’t seem to care what the truth is about our elections, there is a possibility Donald Trump could legitimately win. And if he legitimately wins, the antidemocratic forces on the right have opened the door for at least some activity by antidemocratic forces on the left.

On billionaires and elections

WOLF: You talked about Elon Musk getting involved by spreading misinformation. One other tech billionaire is getting out of the election business. Your group distributed money from Mark Zuckerberg for election integrity in 2020. He recently said that he’s not giving any money this year. What are your thoughts on his decision?

BECKER: First of all, going back to 2020, I don’t know Mark Zuckerberg personally. I’ve never spoken to him. But he and his staff waited through 2020 for government to do what it should have done, for government to come in and say, “We have a global pandemic and a presidential election happening the same year, and election officials are facing an unprecedented situation for which they need additional resources.”

Congress and state legislatures were begged for more resources by election officials and they failed. They did not provide close to adequate resources. And by the end of August of 2020, Zuckerberg’s people came to me and asked me what could they do.

I suggested, well, voters are having a hard time understanding how to navigate the pandemic. Let’s give money to the states that want it to help them educate and inform voters how they can navigate it, as long as it’s done on a bipartisan basis.

I can only speak to the funding they gave my organization. That’s what happened. I contacted literally every single election official in those states, almost all of whom I knew personally. And we offered grants.

The conditions were they be used for voter education relating to the pandemic, and that all of the efforts be nonpartisan. Twenty-three states accepted grants. Some of them were deeply red states won by Trump, some of them were deeply blue states won by (Joe) Biden, and every single state got exactly the amount of money they requested.

We used no discretion. We put out a transparent report on that in March of 2021, and I’m very proud of our work doing that.

What I heard from the people with Zuckerberg’s team that I was working with, and what I personally believe, was this was never an ongoing effort to have philanthropy step up and replace the work that government should do. That was never Plan A.

Government should be funding elections. Government should be providing adequate resources, and it’s still failing to do that. But this is specifically with regard to the pandemic, and so from my perspective, I always knew this is a one-time effort.

I will also say that it’s unfortunate to see very partisan attacks on a philanthropist — who has sought to fill in the gaps that government didn’t fill during a crisis — get attacked as he was, while at the same time, there are extremists on the right-wing side who are attempting to do something similar on a smaller scale, with the tools that supposedly will result in more voters being purged and things along those lines."
politics,"Donald Trump’s rambling answer to a child care question, deconstructed",2024-09-06,Zachary B. Wolf,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

CNN —

Former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance were both asked essentially the same question while thousands of miles apart this week:

How would they bring down the cost of child care, which is a barrier to people having children and a major drain on parents?

Given that the Republican ticket is built around the idea of reversing inflation and appealing to “real” Americans, and that Vance in particular has argued, joking or not, that “childless cat ladies” are a threat to American democracy, it seems like the kind of subject for which they would have something to say.

But the two men gave remarkably different answers, neither of which seem likely to bring down the cost of child care.

Vance, speaking to a conservative activist at an Arizona church on Wednesday, thinks parents should look to grandparents, aunts and uncles for those who have them, and also suggested cutting down on training and certification requirements for day care workers. That answer, at least, focuses on the issue at hand, but it won’t satisfy any parent or potential parents who don’t live near their extended family or whose extended family can’t afford to work for free.

What came out of Trump’s mouth, however, in his talk with the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, was not a direct answer about child care, which he dismissed as ultimately not a very big problem and not that expensive to fix compared with the money he will raise from tariffs.

You could charitably say that he pivoted from the child care question back to his talking points for the day, which had to do with his plan to place taxes, also known as tariffs, on all imports coming into the US.

However, if you have spent any time in recent months listening to Trump’s words in depth – and if you haven’t, you should – his speech at the Republican National Convention, for instance, veered from prepared remarks to wandering musings.

On Friday, he dedicated much of a news conference in New York about his legal problems to a recounting of old sexual misconduct allegations he has denied. It had the effect of reminding people about the allegations.

His response to the child care question, the subject of some ribbing by his political opponents, could accurately be described as a ramble without an answer. It’s worth looking closer at an issue that affects so many Americans.

For more context, CNN’s Tami Luhby looked at the broad strokes of Trump’s general claim, that the new tariffs will pay for Americans’ child care, and found it is not at all clear how that would work. Read Luhby’s report.

The child care question was put to Trump by Reshma Saujani, founder of Moms First and Girls Who Code. Spoiler alert: Saujani was not satisfied with what Trump had to say.

“I don’t even think he’s actually thought about this, and parents are suffering,” she later said on TikTok, arguing families are being crushed by the cost of child care.

While she might not have been expecting much from Trump’s answer, the question as she posed it on stage was detailed and not at all partisan. Here’s what she said:

President Trump, you – you talked about how the increase in the price of food, gas and rent is hurting families, but the real cost that’s breaking families’ backs and preventing women from participating in the workforce is child care. Child care is now more expensive than rent for working families and is costing the economy more than $122 billion a year, making it one of the most urgent economic issues that is facing our country. In fact, the cost of child care is outpacing the cost of inflation, with the majority of American families of young children spending more than 20% of their income on child care. One thing that Democrats and Republicans have in common is that both parties talk a lot about what they’re going to do to address the child care crisis, but neither party has delivered meaningful change. If you win in November, can you commit to prioritizing legislation to make child care affordable? And if so, what specific piece of legislation will you advance? -- Reshma Saujani

Saujani is mostly right on her facts. That $122 billion figure comes from a 2023 study by the nonpartisan nonprofit group Council for a Strong America. Luhby reported in May about another report that found in 11 states and Washington, DC, parents with two kids in a child care center could expect to pay at least twice as much for child care as for typical rent. CNN’s Matt Egan has also reported on the child care crisis.

So, this is not a new issue. But here’s what Trump had to say:

Well, I would do that. And we’re sitting down – you know, I was somebody – we had – Sen. Marco Rubio and my daughter Ivanka were so impactful on that issue. It’s a very important issue.

Trump’s off to a good start here. When she worked in the White House, his daughter Ivanka did help add provisions to Trump’s tax cut law that doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child for millions of Americans, according to a CNN fact check.

However, those increases were not granted to the millions of children whose parents don’t make enough to pay income tax. Democrats would later further expand the child tax credit by up to an additional $1,600 and also gave the credit as cash even to families who don’t pay income taxes. That additional bump and expanding it to all parents was credited with cutting the child poverty rate nearly in half in 2021. But Democrats failed to get the votes for a longer-term expansion of that experiment.

Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to try to permanently extend and expand that credit, and Vance, not the Trump campaign, has also suggested he supports an expansion, but details are sketchy.

Even Trump’s doubling of the credit to $2,000 is set to expire next year, so this will be a key issue for whoever wins the White House. Luhby has written extensively about the child tax credit.

This is where Trump stops making much sense:

But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I’m talking about, that – because, look, child care is child care. It’s – couldn’t – you know, it’s something – you have to have it. In this country, you have to have it.

Yes, you do have to have child care. But what are these numbers he’s talking about?

But when you talk about those numbers compared to the kind of numbers that I’m talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they’re not used to, but they’ll get used to it very quickly – and it’s not going to stop them from doing business with us but they’ll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country.

So Trump has moved from the cost of child care to the taxes – tariffs – he plans to impose on imports.

Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we’re talking about, including child care. That – it’s going to take care – we’re going to have – I – I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country.

Egan has written about the widely held fear among economists that Trump’s proposal to place a new 60% tariff tax on goods from China and a 10% across-the-board tariff on goods from other countries would mostly just be passed along to consumers and not replace income tax for the government. Trump’s not listening to those warnings.

Because I have to say with child care – I want to stay with child care – but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I’m talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just – that I just told you about.

Hear that, parents? The cost of child care is small change compared with all the money the US is going to be bringing in from Trump’s tariffs. What you’re not hearing is a concrete proposal for a tax credit or a program to transform those tariff dollars Trump is sure the US government will be swimming in into help for affording child care.

We’re going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it’s, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in.

Repeat: Child care – actually not very expensive, per Trump.

We’re going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people, and then we’ll worry about the rest of the world. Let’s help other people, but we’re going to take care of our country first. This is about America first, it’s about Make America Great Again. We have to do it because right now we’re a failing nation. So we’ll take care of it. Thank you. Very good question.

Yep. Very good question."
politics,America’s push for an Israel-Hamas deal is a failure on repeat. But the US can’t walk away.,2024-09-06,Stephen Collinson,"For months, the United States has chased a mirage — a deal to free hostages in Gaza, to end the agony of Palestinian civilians there and to pause the fighting between Israel and Hamas.

But its goal has never looked more remote, and the Biden administration has rarely been more estranged from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks and the start of the Israeli onslaught on Gaza.

When an administration repeatedly predicts a foreign policy goal is in sight but fails to deliver, as this one has, it risks shattering its credibility and looks like it’s botched one of its top priorities. Politically damaging scrutiny is inevitable over why the Biden administration squandered capital on an apparently hopeless goal and how it misjudged the situation so badly.

President Joe Biden’s team faces all these negative consequences and its exposure is especially acute because it now appears to be operating in a different reality from Netanyahu. Washington argues that a deal is nine-tenths of the way to completion after diplomacy involving the US and Qatar, while the Israeli leader denies it’s anywhere near close.

Why the US can’t walk away

The motivations that led the administration into this vicious circle of failure haven’t changed. So Washington can’t give up. Biden is under even greater pressure to secure the release of Americans believed to be held in Gaza following Hamas’ murder of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a US-Israeli citizen among six hostages whose bodies were found Sunday. For instance, even a tiny chance of a deal, which could spare other hostages, would have huge human consequences.

The administration’s fervent desire to prevent a spillover regional conflict also means that ending the war remains imperative. The White House has political as well as humanitarian motives in ending the slaughter of Palestinian civilians. Anger over those casualties, especially among progressives and Arab American voters this fall, could threaten the election hopes of Vice President Kamala Harris in the key swing state of Michigan, for instance.

Biden’s decision to end his reelection bid introduced a new and personal dimension of the Middle East crisis for the president. If no ceasefire takes hold in the next few months, he’d face the prospect of handing his successor a failure that would help shape his legacy.

One top Democrat close to the White House told CNN’s MJ Lee that Biden had redoubled his focus on the Middle East since shelving his campaign and was “obsessed” with the issue. US officials are not yet at the point of acknowledging there may be no deal before the president leaves office. But the top Democrat said: “We’re stuck,” adding that “both parties are very dug in.”

Despite its frustration, the White House has not yet used all possible leverage on Netanyahu – and probably won’t.

Biden is a deeply pro-Israel president and has so far been unwilling to bow to progressive demands to restrict US arms sales to Israel to force Netanyahu’s hand. And the prospect of the US walking away from Israel and publicly blaming the impasse on an Israeli prime minister — in a way that would open it to accusations of siding with terrorists — still seems unthinkable. The fraught political circumstances are also one reason why, despite Harris’ willingness to use stiffer rhetoric toward Netanyahu, it’s hard to see her engineering a breach with Israel as one of her first major foreign policy moves if she becomes president.

Netanyahu plays politics at home and in the US

The showdown between Israel and Hamas is so complex because of the historical, ideological and political factors swirling around the negotiations.

Both sides believe they are in an existential battle against the other. Each might believe they are winning and so they don’t want to back down. Meanwhile, the outside political factors that could force their hands have not yet reached a critical point, and third powers have been unable to create that pressure. The incentives for Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, as horrific as those calculations may be, currently lean toward not ending the war.

Bad feeling between Washington and the Israeli government spilled over when Biden on Monday said Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure the release of the hostages and after a senior administration official said later this week that 90% of an agreement had been completed. This was seen by the White House’s Republican critics as an unacceptable attempt to build pressure on Israel.

Netanyahu’s latest justification for not doing a deal center on his refusal to pull troops out of land in southern Gaza known as the Philadelphi Corridor, which he says is critical to Hamas’ capacity to maintain its arms supplies.

But more broadly, he says that US perceptions that a deal is near are false. “It’s exactly inaccurate. There’s a story, a narrative out there, that there’s a deal out there, that’s just a false narrative,” Netanyahu said on Fox News Thursday. He insisted that Israel had agreed to several proposed deals but that Hamas was the obstacle. “They don’t agree to anything: Not to the Philadelphi Corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jailed terrorists, not to anything.” (Reports this summer said Netanyahu also scuppered earlier deals).

His appearance on Fox demonstrated Netanyahu’s long penchant for playing in US domestic politics to pressure the Biden administration at a time when Republican nominee Donald Trump is blaming Harris for the death of the hostages. There are suspicions among many Democrats that Netanyahu is prolonging the war in the hope that Trump — who delivered almost everything he wanted in his first term — could soon be back in the Oval Office.

Disagreements rumbled on between the US and Israel Thursday. White House national security communications adviser John Kirby insisted it was sound to say 90% of a deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the US and Arab states, was done. “You call that optimistic, I call that accurate,” he said.

The US and Netanyahu’s positions are not necessarily contradictory. It’s possible for most of an agreement to be accepted and only 10% of sticking points to remain. There are familiar echoes here: The parameters of a US-Israeli final status deal on statehood have long been known — at least until recent bursts of settlement building in the West Bank — but there has never been the political will between credible leaders on both sides to make the extraordinarily hard political decisions to solve outstanding questions. And even if a deal is agreed in the Middle East, the implementation can be even more problematic that the negotiation.

Sinwar and Netanyahu have other motivations

But the prospects that this agreement could finally get over the line still seem grim.

Netanyahu has left no doubt that he sees the war against Hamas as part of a wider struggle against Iran and its proxies that is existential to the state of Israel and the Jewish people – a position that means he’s considering far more than push for a deal with Hamas.

While he has come under extreme political pressure from families of remaining Israeli hostages to do more to get them out — notably in the resumption of street protests in recent days — the opposition to his continued premiership has not reached a critical mass necessary to topple him.

Many analysts believe Netanyahu wants the war to continue to put off the inevitable inquests on how the worst terror attack in Israel’s history took place on his watch. And Netanyahu would be more vulnerable to fraud and bribery charges and trials that he’s facing if he’s out of office. And his ruling coalition — the most right-wing in Israeli history – has held up, raising questions about whether the Biden administration properly assessed his prospects for survival and the possibilities of what is politically realistic.

Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, told Jim Sciutto on CNN Max on Wednesday that the key number in Netanyahu’s mind was not the tens of thousands of Israelis protesting him on the streets — but 64. “That’s the number of seats that his coalition controls and there is absolutely no indication on the part of any of the parties that they have any stake in fracturing that coalition,” Miller said. “The reality is that there is no urgency on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu or Yahya Sinwar to either let those hostages go or to redeem them through a negotiation.”

In an odd way, Netanyahu and Sinwar’s situations are reinforcing the deadlock. The killing of the hostages bolsters Netanyahu’s narrative that it’s impossible to negotiate with Hamas. But the consequential public protests in Israel build the political pressure on Netanyahu that Sinwar wants to see.

And the Hamas leader has shown no sign that he’s motivated by a desire to spare Palestinian civilians — his organization embedded its military infrastructure and tunnels in civilian areas of Gaza. And the more civilians who die, the greater international opposition crests against Israel, which is also in his interests.

It’s hardly surprising then that there is still not agreement.

The cycle of utter futility was inadvertently underscored by Harris in a CNN interview last week in which she refused to commit to an arms embargo against Israel.

“We have got to get a deal done. … We have to get a deal done. This war must end and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done,” Harris said. “We have to get a deal done. We have to get a deal done.”

Her repeated insistence on the need for a deal mirrored months of administration statements.

But that deal never gets done."
politics,Harris’ attempt to separate herself from Biden on the economy frustrates Trump,2024-09-04,Stephen Collinson,"At the Throwback Brewery, Kamala Harris pivoted to the future, separating herself a little more from Bidenomics as she tries to run as a change candidate from an incumbent administration who is driving Donald Trump to distraction.

The vice president on Wednesday stopped in New Hampshire — home to 4 precious electoral votes — before heading off to debate camp in Pittsburgh ahead of her televised clash with the former president next week that could define the election endgame.

Harris’ political momentum and her chances in November hinge partly on her success in painting herself as a fresh option for voters and dispelling any notion she’s pitching for the second term of the unpopular president, Joe Biden.

This underpins her efforts to court Americans who are sour about high grocery prices and inflation and are locked out of the housing market, as well as her outreach to suburban moderates and middle-class voters in swing states.

The vice president had previously vowed to clamp down on price gouging by supermarket giants and pledged to give low-income, first-time homebuyers $25,000 for a downpayment. On Wednesday, she tacked toward the political middle by promising to nurture 25 million new small businesses in her first term with a $50,000 tax deduction for startups. And she called for a significantly lower hike in capital gains taxes than Biden proposed to spark investment and innovation.

“I believe America’s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy,” Harris said at a brewery founded by two female business pioneers that sources local ingredients. “Small businesses in our country employ half of all private sector workers. Half of all private sector workers own or run a small business or work for a small business.”

The former president, who has been stoking nostalgia for the Trump economy before the crisis set off by the Covid-19 emergency, may attempt to respond to Harris’ recent economic maneuvering when he addresses the New York Economic Club on Thursday.

Seeking distance from Biden

The politics behind Harris’ strategy is clear. On the capital gains tax measure, for instance, Harris ditched a more progressive approach from Biden as she called for a 28% rate on those earning $1 million or more instead of the 39.6% rate that the president included in his budget for fiscal year 2025. Her gesture allows her to show she’s not a hostage to her boss’ policies as she rebuts Trump’s claim that she’s the heiress to a failed economic legacy. The proposal may not go unnoticed either by Democratic donors with wealth in investment income who have helped her raise half a billion dollars in campaign cash.

Harris’ embrace of the powerful mythology of American small businesses driving broader prosperity and the wider economy also seems designed to counter attempts by Trump and surrogates to dismiss the California Democrat as an extreme “San Francisco liberal,” a “communist” and a “Bolshevik.”

Her new approaches have led economists to debate the workability of “Harrisomics.” Would her federal ban on price gouging simply lead to shortages of goods as happened in the past? And would throwing more money into the housing market inevitably trigger price inflation and make homes even more unaffordable?

These questions might prove troublesome in the early weeks of a potential Harris administration. But less than nine weeks from the election, Harris is more concerned with creating a striking political impression than the mechanics of economic policy. Given Trump’s polling advantage on the economy, an in-depth fight on policy on the issue with her rival would probably not be wise anyway. Harris needs to make the election a referendum on personality and on which candidate can pose as a fresh political force. Even small steps out of Biden’s shadow therefore can be important.

Harris has, for instance, done far more than Biden to show that she understands the pain of young adults cut out of the housing market and shoppers who dread the cost of their weekly groceries. During his campaign, the president would often indignantly defend the successes of the economy and downplay the hardship that remains.

Why Harris may need to move away from Biden

James Carville laid out a potential strategy for Harris in a New York Times column Monday. He said the 2024 election would be defined by “who is fresh and who is rotten.” The veteran Democratic strategist also wrote that it would not be an insult to Biden for Harris to go her own way — it was imperative for her political identity. “It shows even more sharply that she is passionate about her own ideas and represents change rather than more of the same,” he wrote, recalling the slogan that helped former President Bill Clinton prevail as a change candidate over President George H.W. Bush in 1992.

Harris’ attempt to convince voters she’s a new breeze is infuriating Trump. The ex-president’s comments and his campaign statements bristle with frustration that Harris, after four years in the Biden administration, is getting a fresh look and that he’s lost his role as change agent in the race.

Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance expressed incredulity that Harris could attempt this pivot in an interview with the Hugh Hewitt radio show on Wednesday. The Ohio senator sought to thwart Harris’ image makeover by stressing she was an incumbent. “You’re the vice president of the United States. You could be pursuing these policies immediately, but you’re not,” Vance said. “She has caused this inflation crisis with her policies, and now she wants to fix it by waving the magic wand.”

Vance also rejected the vice president’s plan for lowering grocery prices even as he admitted that not every American corporation was an “angel.”

“We’ve had price controls before in this country and everywhere else. It fails every time it happens,” Vance said. “It means you’re not able to buy flour. You’re not able to buy eggs in the grocery store. That’s what price controls do.”

The Trump campaign is also seeking to squelch Harris’ economic positioning with a cutting advertising campaign.

One recent ad that ran in Georgia patched together clips of news coverage of tough economic headlines. A television anchor bemoaned “the alarming spike in inflation soaring to its highest level in nearly 40 years.” Another says, “We’re still dealing with inflation.” In between these clips, the campaign shows tape of Harris praising “Bidenomics” and cheerfully saying in speeches that “Bidenomics is working.”

The Trump campaign on Wednesday dismissed the Harris small business plan, arguing that she would push for higher income taxes and expanded inheritance taxes among others that would hurt small firms and consumers. The ex-president has previously balked at the vice president’s adoption of his own proposal to end taxes on tips, which was especially seen as a play for hospitality workers in the swing state of Nevada.

Trump has been proclaiming that if Harris wins in November, the economy would slump into a Great Depression. He said much the same about Biden in 2020, but the president has presided over strong, consistent jobs growth and one of the strongest rebounds from the pandemic of any developed economy, notwithstanding the inflation crisis that his White House initially underestimated.

Trump’s plans are often as vague as those of his Democratic rival. As he did as president, Trump promised great deals for Americans without specifying how he’d make them work or pay for them. He offered this jumble of words on Fox News on Sunday, for instance: “We’re going to take care of Social Security, we’re not going to do anything to hurt our seniors. There is so much cutting, there’s so much waste in this government. There’s so much fat in this government.”

Trump’s plan, meanwhile, to drastically raise tariffs on imports — especially those from China – has prompted many economists to warn he will drastically raise costs for consumers and spark a new round of inflation.

But at this critical moment of a bitter, close campaign, both Harris and Trump seem less concerned with economic policies that are proven to work than those that can deliver an immediate political benefit."

politics,Why Iowa Republicans who once opposed Trump are ready to vote for him,2024-08-18,John King,"Kellerton, Iowa CNN —

Shanen Ebersole is voting for Donald Trump. With plenty of reservations, but zero hesitation.

“It’s definitely a vote for Trump,” Ebersole said. “I’m happy doing that with the choices that we have. I don’t think there is any way I could vote any other direction.”

Ebersole was a Nikki Haley supporter when we first met before the Iowa caucuses. Trump won 59% of the caucus vote in conservative Ringgold County; Ebersole was one of just 16 votes for the former South Carolina governor.

Once Trump locked up the GOP nomination, Ebersole thought a bit about voting third party. But her maverick streak has limits. Her family and her farm come first, so she came home to Trump.

“Because we have to put the American people first,” she said in an interview along the fence line of the Ebersole cattle farm. “I think that the policies that have been in place in the Harris-Biden administration — they hurt this. They hurt our land and they hurt the people of middle America the most.”

Ebersole is part of our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are members of critical voting blocs or areas in those states.

John King talks to Iowa voter Shanen Ebersole on her cattle ranch in Kellerton, Iowa. CNN

Iowa was an early 2024 battleground — the first test of whether Trump’s grip on the GOP had been loosened by his 2020 loss, his conduct on January 6, 2021, or any of the myriad criminal and civil legal proceedings he has faced since leaving the White House. Trump won the caucuses with 51% — the beginning of a march to the nomination that proved his grip on the party remains quite firm but also exposed important weaknesses.

One was among Republican women like Ebersole — those who supported Haley or other GOP contenders because they object to Trump’s combative and often caustic tone and, in many cases, see him as wandering too far from the conservative principles that drew them to the Republican Party.

Iowa, of course, is not considered a battleground in the general election this year. Ebersole’s “pretty simple” decision to support Trump despite her reservations helps explain why.

In the 12 presidential elections dating back to 1976, Iowa was evenly split in its choice for president. But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both of the state’s US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa’s seven statewide constitutional offices.

Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far left

Ebersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.

“I’m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,” Ebersole said. “But if you talk to a lot of us, we’re already doing things. There’s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics — that we get to choose. We’re not being mandated to choose. … We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.”

Ebersole said Trump’s trade policies were better for her business.

“It was much harder to import beef,” she said. “Now most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn’t American beef, and that really concerns me﻿.” She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal — and more likely to favor activist government — than President Joe Biden.

“She is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,” Ebersole said, tying Harris to California’s policies. “Our California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government. Not by their weather conditions, not by any of those things, but by the government policies.”

Harris was the California attorney general from 2011-2017 and has worked in Washington since becoming a senator and now vice president.

The conversation is different here than in the swing states. On recent visits to Arizona and Pennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case. But in Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.

“Most of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,” Ebersole said. “We’re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.”

It may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state, when considering each candidate’s strategy to win 270 electoral votes. But we wanted to better understand why those who were so critical of Trump at the beginning of the campaign cycle are so comfortable supporting him now. We wanted a firsthand look at how our Iowa group — the first one we visited in August 2023 — views the race now that Harris has replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket and chosen a Midwest governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota, to be her running mate.

“He’s trying to figure out how to deal with her,” Chris Mudd, a businessman from Cedar Falls, said of Trump, whom he ardently supports. “I think he spends too much time bashing and complaining. … I think he’ll catch his stride. I think he will get back on his horse.”

John King talks with Iowa voter Chris Mudd in Cedar Falls. CNN

Mudd owns Midwest Solar, and business is strong in part because of Biden administration clean energy tax incentives.

But Mudd would gladly give up that help in exchange for Trump’s policies on regulation and immigration.

“If all I was selling was government incentives, I don’t think business would be very good,” Mudd said in an interview at his home. “But that’s not what we’re selling. We’re selling the power to help people save money.”

Mudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.

“I think about what’s happening in the Middle East,” Mudd said. “Who would I want to negotiate that peace? Kamala or Donald Trump? And for me, it’s simple.”

Mudd believes the media is too soft on Harris, and he echoes Trump and his MAGA media allies in complaining the vice president rarely takes questions from reporters. He also echoes another line coming from Trump, suggesting there is no way Harris can win an honest election.

“There were shenanigans,” Mudd said when asked what he would think if Harris wins the White House. “I don’t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight. … I just don’t believe it is possible. I really don’t. … Many like me would think the same thing: If Kamala Harris gets 81 million votes, something really went haywire.”

Previously leaning toward Biden in a 2020 rematch, but now for Trump

Betsy Sarcone considers such talk a waste of time.

“I don’t buy the stolen election,” said Sarcone, a mother of three who lives in the Des Moines suburbs. “If she wins, she wins. I am not getting on that bandwagon.”

But the fact that Sarcone plans to vote for Trump is a big change from our first conversation just over a year ago.

Then, she said it was time for the Republican Party to find new leadership and that if the 2024 election ended up as a 2020 rematch, she would vote for Biden.

But Sarcone said grocery prices are still too high, her real estate business too slow.

“I would describe myself as being resigned to voting for Donald Trump,” Sarcone said. “I just can’t vote for the status quo and I was absolutely better off during Donald Trump’s presidency than I am today.”

Sarcone has a dim view of Harris.

“She’s already been in office,” she said. “She could have done something about the economy. She could have done something about the border.”

Like the others in our Iowa group, Sarcone places Harris to the left of Biden.

“I’d say far left,” she said. “I’d say woke.”

Sarcone sees Trump as rattled by the switch to Harris.

“I think he is handling it wrong,” she said. “I wish that he would stick to the issues and cut the side conversations that are not relevant.”

Sioux City attorney Priscilla Forsyth, too, sees Trump as off his game now that Harris is his opponent.

“She’s pulling his chain,” Forsyth said. “I don’t think he knows what to think.”

When we first met Forsyth last August, she was impressed with another GOP candidate, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Soon, though, she would label him shallow and childish and shift her allegiance to Haley.

Now, though, Forsyth sees Harris as “radical” and has no qualms about voting for Trump.

“I see Kamala and I see Walz as being so far left it concerns me,” Forsyth said in an interview.

“I’m comfortable with Trump. We had four years of Trump. We know what Trump is. We know what to expect. We all survived. … I’m not voting for him to be my valentine. I’m not voting for him to be my best friend. I think he did an OK job running the country.”"
politics,Why Iowa Republicans who once opposed Trump are ready to vote for him,2024-08-18,John King,"Kellerton, Iowa CNN —

Shanen Ebersole is voting for Donald Trump. With plenty of reservations, but zero hesitation.

“It’s definitely a vote for Trump,” Ebersole said. “I’m happy doing that with the choices that we have. I don’t think there is any way I could vote any other direction.”

Ebersole was a Nikki Haley supporter when we first met before the Iowa caucuses. Trump won 59% of the caucus vote in conservative Ringgold County; Ebersole was one of just 16 votes for the former South Carolina governor.

Once Trump locked up the GOP nomination, Ebersole thought a bit about voting third party. But her maverick streak has limits. Her family and her farm come first, so she came home to Trump.

“Because we have to put the American people first,” she said in an interview along the fence line of the Ebersole cattle farm. “I think that the policies that have been in place in the Harris-Biden administration — they hurt this. They hurt our land and they hurt the people of middle America the most.”

Ebersole is part of our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are members of critical voting blocs or areas in those states.

John King talks to Iowa voter Shanen Ebersole on her cattle ranch in Kellerton, Iowa. CNN

Iowa was an early 2024 battleground — the first test of whether Trump’s grip on the GOP had been loosened by his 2020 loss, his conduct on January 6, 2021, or any of the myriad criminal and civil legal proceedings he has faced since leaving the White House. Trump won the caucuses with 51% — the beginning of a march to the nomination that proved his grip on the party remains quite firm but also exposed important weaknesses.

One was among Republican women like Ebersole — those who supported Haley or other GOP contenders because they object to Trump’s combative and often caustic tone and, in many cases, see him as wandering too far from the conservative principles that drew them to the Republican Party.

Iowa, of course, is not considered a battleground in the general election this year. Ebersole’s “pretty simple” decision to support Trump despite her reservations helps explain why.

In the 12 presidential elections dating back to 1976, Iowa was evenly split in its choice for president. But Republicans have dominated of late. Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Both of the state’s US senators are Republican, as are six of Iowa’s seven statewide constitutional offices.

Voters who say life was better under Trump fear Democrats have shifted too far left

Ebersole shared a view quite common here: that the Democratic Party is trending more liberal, more coastal, and more in favor of government mandates in climate and land policies.

“I’m not saying that there are not things we can do to improve,” Ebersole said. “But if you talk to a lot of us, we’re already doing things. There’s a huge regenerative movement here in the Americas by choice, not my mandate. I think that is the main thing that matters in politics — that we get to choose. We’re not being mandated to choose. … We just want to live in the middle of nowhere and raise cows and feed our neighbors across the country.”

Ebersole said Trump’s trade policies were better for her business.

“It was much harder to import beef,” she said. “Now most meat that you eat, on the American grocery store shelves, isn’t American beef, and that really concerns me﻿.” She sees Vice President Kamala Harris as more liberal — and more likely to favor activist government — than President Joe Biden.

“She is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,” Ebersole said, tying Harris to California’s policies. “Our California rancher friends are completely decimated by the policies and the government. Not by their weather conditions, not by any of those things, but by the government policies.”

Harris was the California attorney general from 2011-2017 and has worked in Washington since becoming a senator and now vice president.

The conversation is different here than in the swing states. On recent visits to Arizona and Pennsylvania, for example, some of our Republican voters who are not Trump fans said they would give Harris a chance to make her case. But in Iowa, the Republicans in our group were harshly critical of the vice president and more comfortable with coming home to the GOP despite issues they may have with Trump and his most vocal MAGA allies.

“Most of the people that vote for Trump are just quiet people who want to live our own lives in our own place,” Ebersole said. “We’re willing to tell those people to quiet down a bit.”

It may seem an odd time to visit Iowa, given its status as a solid red state, when considering each candidate’s strategy to win 270 electoral votes. But we wanted to better understand why those who were so critical of Trump at the beginning of the campaign cycle are so comfortable supporting him now. We wanted a firsthand look at how our Iowa group — the first one we visited in August 2023 — views the race now that Harris has replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket and chosen a Midwest governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota, to be her running mate.

“He’s trying to figure out how to deal with her,” Chris Mudd, a businessman from Cedar Falls, said of Trump, whom he ardently supports. “I think he spends too much time bashing and complaining. … I think he’ll catch his stride. I think he will get back on his horse.”

John King talks with Iowa voter Chris Mudd in Cedar Falls. CNN

Mudd owns Midwest Solar, and business is strong in part because of Biden administration clean energy tax incentives.

But Mudd would gladly give up that help in exchange for Trump’s policies on regulation and immigration.

“If all I was selling was government incentives, I don’t think business would be very good,” Mudd said in an interview at his home. “But that’s not what we’re selling. We’re selling the power to help people save money.”

Mudd also believes Trump is more tested on the world stage.

politics,These Pennsylvania voters illustrate Harris’ suburban challenge,2024-08-12,John King,"Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania CNN —

Carol Carty misses something in today’s Republican Party and searches for it in her music choices.

“I was young when (Ronald) Reagan was around, but I really miss the ’80s,” Carty said. “I do. I’m now turning on ‘80s songs to go back to the ‘80s more than ever. I do feel like, in my lifetime, the Republican Party has changed with Donald Trump and not in a good way.”

Carty is an attorney who lives just across the Philadelphia line in suburban Montgomery County.

“It was very Republican when I was growing up,” Carty said in an interview in her Bala Cynwyd home. “And it is Democratic now.”

Carty pines for the GOP that drew her in at the age of 18: a party defined by lower taxes, less regulation, respect for the courts and the Constitution. She wishes the GOP would support reasonable gun safety measures, and let women – not politicians or judges – make difficult decisions about reproductive rights.

“A ‘Never Trump’ Republican,” Carty said. “That is how I would best label myself.”

And yet as recently as a few weeks ago, she planned to vote for Trump — and it’s not out of the question that she still might.

She backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. So why the openness to Trump this year? Carty is exasperated with Biden over inflation, immigration and more. She watched the June debate and found herself in a place for eight years she thought impossible.

“When Biden was on the ticket, I was going to vote for Trump,” Carty said. “Now it is a harder call, just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump. … I want to give Kamala Harris a chance because she deserves that chance.”

Carty is part of a CNN project, All Over the Map, to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who are members of key voting blocs and who live in critical areas within the battleground states. Her views are telling, all the more so because they were shared by other supporters of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Reagan Republicans in our group. Harris’ ascendance on the Democratic ticket is shaking up the race in the pivotal suburbs. But the belief that she is to the left of Biden creates a quandary for Republicans who do not want Trump back in the White House but have policy and personal doubts about Harris.

“I definitely want to learn more,” Carty said. “I want to hear from Kamala Harris, what exactly have you been doing as vice president? Not what the administration has been doing in general. … What were her goals? Did she achieve them?”

That Carty isn’t ready to commit to Harris despite her profound disagreements with Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is a snapshot of the vice president’s suburban challenge: her path to victory is clearer if she can win over a good share of moderate Republicans who voted for Biden because they viewed him as a centrist or disagreed with Trump’s reaction to the Covid pandemic or were exhausted by his tweets and other chaos – or all of that.

Turned off by Vance but pleased with Walz

In Carty’s case, Harris may be getting an assist from Trump’s running mate.

“I’m not a cat lady,” Carty said, some toys belonging to her 5-year-old daughter stacked in the corner of the room. “I was a childless dog lady. Because I didn’t meet the right person until I was over 40 years old. And it’s by the grace of God that we naturally had a child. So I could very well be one of those childless women and I found the comment insensitive and narrow-minded,” she said, alluding to 2021 remarks from Vance.

Carty objects to Trump’s conduct on January 6, 2021, and his constant attacks on judges and courts. “We have to remember the Constitution,” she said. “Does he really promote domestic tranquility?”

And whereas Vance has been a disappointment to Carty, she’s pleased with Harris’ pick to share the ticket.

“She just picked an excellent running mate,” Carty said of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “So I am going to listen to them. I’m going to really hear what they have to say. … So I have a reason. Essentially not to vote for Donald Trump. He’s like the last resort.”

While Carty has her reservations, and looks forward to a Trump-Harris debate, she notices a clear shift in recent conversations with friends.

“Definitely I have more friends saying they’re leaning toward Harris,” Carty said.

‘Never Trump’ Republicans not yet sold on Harris

Cynthia Sabatini lives in Delaware County. Like Carty, she remembers when the suburbs were very different.

“My street was rock-ribbed Republican,” Sabatini said in an interview at her home in Media, Pennsylvania. “Now you have to shake a stick to find the Republican.”

The suburban shift, at the presidential level anyway, began earlier than most Republicans tend to remember. George H.W. Bush was the last Republican to carry the suburban Philadelphia collar counties in a presidential race – back in 1988. But the Democratic advantage has become more lopsided in recent years, and in 2020, was especially pronounced.

“I watch his campaign rallies,” Sabatini said of Trump. “It is all about him. It is not about the country.”

Close elections are complicated, and it is overly simplistic to focus on any one subgroup. But one of several to watch, in the battleground states decided by narrow margins, are voters who describe themselves, like Sabatini, as “never Trump.”

In 2016, she wrote in a Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine. Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania that year. In 2020, Sabatini voted for Biden because, she said, “I didn’t want to see Trump elected after the chaos of the previous four years.” Biden won Pennsylvania and the White House.

“I didn’t vote for him in 2016,” Sabatini said of Trump. “I didn’t vote for him in 2020. And I don’t plan to vote for him in 2024.”

The question is, will she vote for Harris or cast another write-in ballot?

“I promised myself I will keep an open mind,” she said.

Sabatini said she has read things that worry her about the vice president.

She mentioned immigration policy, and reports Harris is tough on her staff.

“I have some preconceived notions about her,” she said. “I want to find out for myself if the rap on her, as I read it, is correct.”

So far, Sabatini said Harris “certainly has injected enthusiasm into the Democratic base and she brings an energy that certainly Biden couldn’t bring to the campaign. … There’s been, you know, quite a pleasant surprise.”

But Sabatini said she needs to hear more, on economic policy, on immigration and on leadership.

“I am particularly interested in the debates,” she said. “I want to see up close and personal how she answers the questions put to her.”

Joan London is, like Sabatini, inclined at the moment to write in a Republican she finds acceptable.

“If Donald Trump or JD Vance really says something so outrageously offensive beyond some of the things that he has said, that could drive me to vote for Vice President Harris,” said London, an attorney whose clients include municipal governments in Berks County, a more rural, Republican County just outside Philadelphia’s suburban collar.

“But it is highly unlikely,” London said. “She just doesn’t represent my values and my beliefs about policy.”

London became a Republican at the age of 18, inspired by Reagan. But she switched her registration to independent earlier this year, repulsed by Trump. Just before the switch, she cast a GOP primary vote for Haley.

There was “zero chance” she would vote for Trump anyway. But London said the Vance “cat lady” comments made her even more proud to have left Trump’s GOP.

She is married, no children or pets. Her home is decorated with family photos – her husband, her sister and her niece.

“I’ve led a very full life that way, and to say I don’t have a stake in the future of the country, I had some difficulty with that,” London said of Vance’s comments. “All I could think of Senator Vance is, are you going to tell Condoleezza Rice or Ann Coulter or Elizabeth Dole they are miserable cat ladies? I don’t think so.”

Resignation to voting for the Trump alternative amid a changed campaign

Michael Pesce, too, has questions and looks forward to debates and other campaign events to see how Harris steps out of Biden’s shadow and lays out her own ideas.

But Pesce is one Reagan Repubican ready to commit, because his opposition to Trump is unwavering. The Vance picked “reaffirmed” his take on Trump.

“He could have gone with somebody who was more centrist but he went with someone who is a sycophant, who is exactly like him,” Pesce said in an interview in Newtown, part of Bucks County. “Do I want JD Vance to be my president? It’s more of the same, so no.”

When Biden stepped aside, Pesce wished for “more of an open debate in the Democratic Party as to who they were going to run. But it is what it is.”

“I’m still not going to vote for Trump regardless,” Pesce said. “I’m not excited about voting for Kamala Harris, but it’s better than the alternative.”

Pennsylvania voter Michael Pesce walks with John King in Bucks County. CNN

When we first met Pesce three months ago, just after his GOP primary vote for Haley, he said he would support Biden despite reservations about some policies and about his age. After the June debate, Pesce was quick to say he thought Democrats should look for a new candidate.

“No way,” is how he puts Biden’s chances of winning Pennsylvania after his debate performance. “There would have been no way.”

Harris, he believes, has a chance and like the others we visited with, Pesce said the vibe of the campaign has changed completely.

“I think having a younger candidate is going to make a difference,” Pesce said. “I think the energy she’s brought to the campaign, the fact that she’s a woman and women’s rights are going to be a big deal here in Pennsylvania. And I think that’s kind of where Pennsylvania will go.”"

politics,Fact check: Trump and Vance keep falsely describing how tariffs work,2024-09-09,Katie Lobosco,"Washington CNN —

Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals, across-the-board tariffs, would work.

Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China – not US importers – pay the tariff.

At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.”

“She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said.

In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News: “It’s not a tax on the middle class. It’s a tax on another country.”

And he said again during a rally in Wisconsin Saturday that “it’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.”

Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.”

“They went up for the Chinese but they went down for our people,” Vance added.

But that’s not true.

Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. One of the intended goals of a tariff is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, and study after study show that the duties do drive up costs for Americans.

Tariffs are a tax

Here’s how tariffs work: When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American buyer.

“It’s fair to call a tariff a tax because that’s exactly what it is,” said Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.

“There’s no way around it. It is a tax on people who buy things from foreign businesses,” she added.

Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar.

These duties would add to the tariffs he put on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines, and many Chinese-made goods including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. President Joe Biden has left many of the Trump-era tariffs in place.

It’s possible that a foreign company chooses to pay the tariff or to lower its prices to stay competitive with US-made goods that aren’t impacted by the duty.

But study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.

To date, Americans have paid more than $242 billion to the US Treasury for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods, according to US Customs and Border Protection.

Tariffs costs are passed from the US importer to the US consumer

Once an American importing company pays the tariff to the US Treasury, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it along to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer.

For example, American shoe seller Deer Stags, which imports most of its product line from China, decided to do a little bit of both.

It was harder to get customers to pay more for existing styles that Deer Stags had carried for a long time, president Rick Muskat told CNN. So the company ended up eating the cost of the tariffs placed on some older styles and charging more for some new items.

There are many factors that can affect a retailer’s decision to raise prices on some items and not others.

Some goods affected by Trump’s tariffs saw “sharp price increases,” but overall, the tariffs’ impact on retail prices “is more mixed,” one study published in 2019 found.

“Somebody in the United States has to pay this tax,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

“If it’s not consumers, it’s going to be companies. And if it’s companies that pay it, ultimately, the cost is going to be borne, by some degree, by workers,” he said.

Tariffs are meant to raise prices – and do

Even though the full cost of the tariff may not be passed from the retailer to the consumer, there’s widespread consensus among economists that some prices do rise for consumers due to tariffs.

For example, the median price of washing machines in the US rose by about $86 – or nearly 12% – after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made ones, according to a study published in 2019. The researchers also found that the price of dryers – which were not impacted by tariffs – but are usually sold in a package with washing machines – also increased by 12%, or about $92 per unit.

Together, the price increases cost consumers more than $1.5 billion during the first year the tariffs were in place. The duties expired in 2023.

A US International Trade Commission study published last year confirmed that prices went up for consumers on both imported and domestically made washing machines.

One of the goals of using tariffs is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, making it easier for domestic producers to sell goods at a competitive price.

A report Trump was required to send to Congress in 2018 about the washing machine tariffs said that the duties would “provide an impetus for importers to increase their prices.” In fact, the tariffs were put in place in response to Whirlpool’s complaint that washing machines made in South Korea and Mexico were being sold in the US for less than they cost to produce.

When asked for proof that Trump’s proposed tariffs would not raise prices, his campaign pointed CNN to a study from Jeff Ferry, an economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America – a group that advocates for US producers and manufacturers.

But Ferry’s study actually found that prices would rise by 3.26% over a six-year period following the implementation of the across-the-board tariffs, as a one-time price increase.

His analysis looked at the impact the tariffs would have when combined with tax cuts paid for with the tariff revenue. In that scenario, Americans would see lower taxes and higher incomes despite the increase in prices, according to his study.

Ferry told CNN that the traditional economic model used by most economists to analyze the price of tariffs downplays the positives that can happen – like an increase in domestic production and the creation of jobs – and that he adjusted his model accordingly.

It’s true that after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made steel, some American steel companies reopened mills and created new jobs. But several studies – like one from the Tax Foundation and another from the US-China Business Council – say that overall, the US economy lost jobs due to Trump’s tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs other countries put on US goods and agricultural products.

politics,Fact check: Trump and Vance keep falsely describing how tariffs work,2024-09-09,Katie Lobosco,"Washington CNN —

Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals, across-the-board tariffs, would work.

Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China – not US importers – pay the tariff.

At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.”

“She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said.

In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News: “It’s not a tax on the middle class. It’s a tax on another country.”

And he said again during a rally in Wisconsin Saturday that “it’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.”

Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.”

“They went up for the Chinese but they went down for our people,” Vance added.

But that’s not true.

Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border.

politics,Analysis: Trump is still telling lies he told eight years ago,2024-09-03,Daniel Dale,"Washington CNN —

In a speech last week to the National Guard Association of the United States, former President Donald Trump claimed that he was the president who “created” the Veterans Choice health care program, and got it “passed in Congress,” after others had wanted to do so “for 57 years.”

In reality, President Barack Obama was the president who signed the program into law in 2014. The law Trump signed in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, expanded the Veterans Choice program but didn’t create it.

I could fact-check this Trump lie half-asleep – because he’s been telling it for more than six years.

Trump’s lying is most exceptional in its relentlessness, a never-ending avalanche of wrongness that can bury even the most devoted fact-checkers. But it’s also notable for its repetitiveness. He has found his hits, and he’ll keep playing them no matter how many times they are debunked.

As Trump enters the post-Labor Day sprint of his 2024 campaign for the presidency, his commentary is filled with many of the same false claims he made as president from 2017 to 2021. He’s even repeating some of the false claims he used during his 2016 presidential campaign.

Trump keeps deploying his old favorites

As a fact-check reporter for CNN, I watch or read the transcript of every public appearance by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris’ campaign remarks to date have been heavy on thematic rhetoric and light on assertions of fact, with a smattering of false or misleading claims, Trump’s 2024 interviews and speeches are littered with old falsehoods I’ve come to call “the repeats” – assertions I have fact-checked as false over and over for years.

For example, Trump falsely claimed on a podcast last week that people are saying global warming will cause the oceans to rise just “an eighth of an inch in 355 years.” He was saying near-identical nonsense in 2019. (Sea levels are already rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.)

Trump falsely claimed at a rally last month that his tariffs on imported Chinese goods are paid by China, not Americans, and that no previous president had generated even “10 cents” from tariffs on Chinese goods. He was saying the same in 2018. (The tariff payments are made by US importers, not Chinese exporters, and the US government was already generating billions per year from such tariffs before Trump took office.)

Trump falsely claimed in a speech in mid-August that he had warned the US not to invade Iraq. That claim was a key part of his campaign pitch in 2015 and 2016. (Trump expressed tentative support for the 2003 invasion about six months before it occurred, did not express a firm opinion on an invasion about two months before it occurred, and only came out as an opponent of the war post-invasion.)

Trump’s false claims in the podcast interview last week that some NATO members were “delinquent” and “owed … huge amounts of money” before he took office were also staples of his 2016 run. (NATO members didn’t owe anybody money even if they were not meeting the alliance’s voluntary 2%-of-GDP guideline for their own defense spending.)

Trump’s regular false claims of a “rigged” 2020 election echo his language from both his 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign. (The claims were baseless then and are baseless now.)

And less importantly, when Trump declared in June, July and again on Thursday that he had been named “Man of the Year” in Michigan long before he entered politics, it was the third straight presidential election he had told this silly lie he debuted in 2016. (There is no evidence the award even exists, let alone that Trump, who has never lived in Michigan, received it.)

How the repetition works for Trump – and doesn’t

Nobody really knows how much of Trump’s deployment of old lies is strategic and how much is mere force of habit. Regardless, his persistence produces a clear benefit for him.

News outlets tend to focus on new material. While some outlets may be inclined to fact-check a false Trump claim the first, second, third or even 10th time he utters it, they are far less likely to devote precious resources to a claim on the 100th or 150th utterance – especially because he is constantly mixing in dozens of new lies that require time and resources to address. And so, by virtue of shameless perseverance, Trump often manages to outlast most of the media’s willingness to correct any particular falsehood, eventually getting that claim into news coverage and social media clips nearly uncorrected.

That’s not to say his lying is an unmitigated victory.

Numerous polls have found for years that a clear majority of voters do not see Trump as honest; from talking to Americans around the country since 2015, I know there are a lot of people who distrust almost anything he says. I have no doubt that his insistence on continuing to say dozens of things people have already learned are false is part of the reason why.

Still, I try to match Trump’s tirelessness in lying with my own tirelessness in challenging the lies. The separation of fact from fiction is central to journalists’ role in the democratic process, and there are always citizens out there who are hearing even the stalest of deceptions for the first time.

So as long as Trump or any other major political figure keeps reviving their past nonsense, we should keep debunking that nonsense. Even if we already did it eight years ago."

politics,KFILE: Harris pledged support in 2019 to cut ICE funding and provide transgender surgery to detained migrants,2024-09-09,Andrew Kaczynski,"As Kamala Harris pivots to the political center in her campaign for president, a 2019 questionnaire from a leading civil rights organization spotlights her past support for left-wing causes such as taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners.

In an American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire then-Sen. Harris filled out as a candidate for president in 2020, she also expressed support for decriminalizing federal drug possession for personal use, and for sweeping reductions to Immigration and Custom Enforcement operations, including drastic cuts in ICE funding and an open-ended pledge to “end” immigration detention.

The questionnaire has received scant media attention and a spokesperson for the ACLU claimed it had remained live from 2019.

But the ACLU’s website upload and page source indicate the questionnaire was reposted last month after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. CNN was unable to find questionnaires filled out by other candidates from the 2020 campaign that the ACLU had reposted.

Harris has acknowledged that some of her stances have evolved over time but that she holds core beliefs that remain unshakable: “My values have not changed,” she said in an interview with CNN last month.

The ACLU questionnaire, which was sent to all Democratic and Republican candidates during the 2020 presidential campaign, provides a clear record of Harris’ progressive stances. Some candidates did not respond to the questionnaire, including Joe Biden. The ACLU later ran radio ads attacking Biden for not answering.

The ACLU also had volunteers question candidates at public town halls and later posted videos on their website of their responses.

During one town hall event in New Hampshire in April 2019, Harris was asked by a voter if she supports adding a “third gender” to federal identification cards.

“Sure,” Harris answered to a round of applause from the crowd. “I have my entire life and career been an ally and I see the issue of LGBTQ rights as a fundamental civil rights and human rights issue, period,” Harris said.

In her response, Harris also attacked the Trump administration’s efforts to ban transgender troops in the military, calling it “outrageous.”

“These are people who have decided they are willing to sacrifice and serve for the sake of our democracy and our freedom, and you’re going to kick them out of the military?” Harris said.

The ACLU told CNN it doesn’t plan on sending Harris a new questionnaire this election.

The Harris campaign did not answer questions from CNN on whether she continued to support these positions and instead provided a statement attributable only to an unnamed “Harris campaign advisor” saying, “The Vice President’s positions have been shaped by three years of effective governance as part of the Biden-Harris Administration.”

They declined to elaborate on what her positions were.

They also provided a comment attributed to a Harris campaign spokesperson saying, “As President, she will take that same pragmatic approach, focusing on common-sense solutions for the sake of progress.”

Immigration

Harris’ starkest contrast to her current positions might be her new tough immigration rhetoric versus what she told the ACLU.

When asked about criminal justice reform on the questionnaire, she wrote she would end immigration detention facilities (along with private prisons). Harris also said she supported decreasing funding for ICE.

“Our immigrant detention system is out of control, and I believe we must end the unfair incarceration of thousands of individuals, families and children,” Harris wrote. “I was one of the first Senators after President Trump was elected to advocate for a decrease in funding to ICE.”

Harris appears to be citing her efforts in 2017 to oppose increased ICE funding under Trump.

Harris wrote that in 2018 she had introduced the Detention Oversight, Not Expansion (DONE) Act to, “increase oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, slash detention by at least 50%, and halt funding for the construction or expansion of new facilities.”

Harris also pledged to end the use of ICE detainers – requests by ICE to local or state law enforcement to hold an individual up to 48 hours beyond their release time so ICE can take them into custody for possible deportation.

During the Trump administration, ICE aggressively targeted undocumented immigrants, including asylum seekers, for detention and deportation. Under the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, ICE expanded its use of detention centers, conducted more workplace raids and increased arrests of undocumented immigrants without criminal records.

The Biden-Harris administration continued to issue detainer requests, but the rate fell sharply in the months after the January 2021 inauguration, according to data from Syracuse University.

Harris also noted that as California attorney general, she had issued guidance saying local law enforcement would not have to comply with such detainers.

“As president, I will focus enforcement on increasing public safety, not tearing apart immigrant families. This includes requiring ICE to obtain a warrant where probable cause exists as to end the use of detainers,” she wrote.

ICE had clashed with many so-called sanctuary cities that limited their cooperation during Trump’s presidency. In response, the Trump administration attempted to withhold certain federal grants and increased efforts to bypass local authorities to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.

As San Francisco district attorney, Harris supported immigrant rights by defending the city’s sanctuary status, stating at the time, “We are a sanctuary city, a city of refuge, and we always will be.”

However, Harris also backed a policy that turned over undocumented juvenile immigrants to federal authorities if they were arrested for suspected felonies, regardless of conviction.

As California attorney general, Harris targeted criminal gangs that operated across the US-Mexico border. She also expressed support for undocumented immigrants deemed not to pose a public safety threat, and opposed Obama-era policies that could send non-criminal undocumented immigrants into deportation proceedings.

Transgender rights

Harris also wrote that she supported taxpayer funding of gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners.

Harris was asked if, as president, she would use “executive authority to ensure that transgender and non-binary people who rely on the state for medical care – including those in prison and immigration detention – will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care.”

Harris replied, “Yes.”

“It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition,” Harris wrote in a reply expanding on her answer. “That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates,” she wrote.

Harris explained that she supported granting prisoners and detainees access to “surgical care” for gender transition.

“Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment,” she wrote.

The first-ever gender-affirming surgery in federal prison occurred only recently in 2022 after years of legal battles.

Harris’ answer marked a change from her previous position as California attorney general, when she defended the California Department of Corrections’ attempts to deny gender transition surgery.

While running for president in 2019, Harris faced criticism over that previous position.

At a news conference and later a LGBTQ forum that year, Harris said defending the policy was “contrary to my beliefs” but she was obligated to defend policy while she “worked behind the scenes” to change it.

Drugs

Harris also indicated she supported the decriminalization of all drug possession for personal use.

While Harris indicated she supported drug legalization, her answer focused solely on marijuana, citing her co-sponsorship of the Marijuana Justice Act, which sought to legalize federal marijuana.

She explained that drug use should be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one.

“Throughout my career, I have supported treating drug addiction as a public health issue, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for drug-related offenses,” she wrote.

During her 2019 campaign, Harris admitted to smoking marijuana in the past in calling for its legalization."

They also provided a comment attributed to a Harris campaign spokesperson saying, “As President, she will take that same pragmatic approach, focusing on common-sense solutions for the sake of progress.”

Immigration

Harris’ starkest contrast to her current positions might be her new tough immigration rhetoric versus what she told the ACLU.

When asked about criminal justice reform on the questionnaire, she wrote she would end immigration detention facilities (along with private prisons). Harris also said she supported decreasing funding for ICE.

“Our immigrant detention system is out of control, and I believe we must end the unfair incarceration of thousands of individuals, families and children,” Harris wrote. “I was one of the first Senators after President Trump was elected to advocate for a decrease in funding to ICE.”

Harris appears to be citing her efforts in 2017 to oppose increased ICE funding under Trump.

Harris wrote that in 2018 she had introduced the Detention Oversight, Not Expansion (DONE) Act to, “increase oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, slash detention by at least 50%, and halt funding for the construction or expansion of new facilities.”

Harris also pledged to end the use of ICE detainers – requests by ICE to local or state law enforcement to hold an individual up to 48 hours beyond their release time so ICE can take them into custody for possible deportation.

During the Trump administration, ICE aggressively targeted undocumented immigrants, including asylum seekers, for detention and deportation. Under the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, ICE expanded its use of detention centers, conducted more workplace raids and increased arrests of undocumented immigrants without criminal records.

The Biden-Harris administration continued to issue detainer requests, but the rate fell sharply in the months after the January 2021 inauguration, according to data from Syracuse University.

Harris also noted that as California attorney general, she had issued guidance saying local law enforcement would not have to comply with such detainers.

“As president, I will focus enforcement on increasing public safety, not tearing apart immigrant families. This includes requiring ICE to obtain a warrant where probable cause exists as to end the use of detainers,” she wrote.

ICE had clashed with many so-called sanctuary cities that limited their cooperation during Trump’s presidency. In response, the Trump administration attempted to withhold certain federal grants and increased efforts to bypass local authorities to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.

As San Francisco district attorney, Harris supported immigrant rights by defending the city’s sanctuary status, stating at the time, “We are a sanctuary city, a city of refuge, and we always will be.”

However, Harris also backed a policy that turned over undocumented juvenile immigrants to federal authorities if they were arrested for suspected felonies, regardless of conviction.

As California attorney general, Harris targeted criminal gangs that operated across the US-Mexico border. She also expressed support for undocumented immigrants deemed not to pose a public safety threat, and opposed Obama-era policies that could send non-criminal undocumented immigrants into deportation proceedings.

Transgender rights

Harris also wrote that she supported taxpayer funding of gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners.

Harris was asked if, as president, she would use “executive authority to ensure that transgender and non-binary people who rely on the state for medical care – including those in prison and immigration detention – will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care.”

Harris replied, “Yes.”

“It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition,” Harris wrote in a reply expanding on her answer. “That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates,” she wrote.

Harris explained that she supported granting prisoners and detainees access to “surgical care” for gender transition.

“Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment,” she wrote.

The first-ever gender-affirming surgery in federal prison occurred only recently in 2022 after years of legal battles.

Harris’ answer marked a change from her previous position as California attorney general, when she defended the California Department of Corrections’ attempts to deny gender transition surgery.

While running for president in 2019, Harris faced criticism over that previous position.

At a news conference and later a LGBTQ forum that year, Harris said defending the policy was “contrary to my beliefs” but she was obligated to defend policy while she “worked behind the scenes” to change it.

Drugs

Harris also indicated she supported the decriminalization of all drug possession for personal use.

While Harris indicated she supported drug legalization, her answer focused solely on marijuana, citing her co-sponsorship of the Marijuana Justice Act, which sought to legalize federal marijuana.

She explained that drug use should be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one.

“Throughout my career, I have supported treating drug addiction as a public health issue, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for drug-related offenses,” she wrote.

During her 2019 campaign, Harris admitted to smoking marijuana in the past in calling for its legalization."

Recent TV ads highlight her time as a “border state prosecutor” who aggressively targeted criminal cartels and drug smugglers, as well as her support for “the toughest border security bill in decades.”

That bill, which failed in the Senate in February and again in May, included $650 million for new border wall construction. Images of the border wall built during the Trump administration are featured in the Harris ads, yet Harris repeatedly criticized the wall over the years, describing it as an affront to both hers and America’s values.

In her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” Harris called the wall “useless” and said it was “nothing more than a symbol, a monument standing in opposition to not just everything I value, but to the fundamental values upon which this country was built.”

A CNN KFile review of Harris’ social media posts found that she criticized the border wall more than 50 times during the Trump administration, calling it, among other things, “stupid,” “useless,” and a “medieval vanity project.”

As she tries to strengthen her image on the border, Harris will have to reckon with her years of opposing some of the very policies she now embraces. That includes building more border wall and also making it harder for migrants to come to the US seeking asylum.

Harris has tacked to the middle on other key issues, such as no longer banning fracking or supporting Medicare for All — positions she once supported before being picked as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee.

In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last Thursday, Harris said, despite her policy shifts, “my values have not changed.”

Immigration and the border remain significant vulnerabilities for Harris and the Democratic party, according to some national polls, although recent polling suggests Harris has managed to narrow the gap.

Not all border work stopped during the Biden administration.

In 2021 and 2022, the administration continued work near the border wall to prevent flooding, complete prior construction of access roads and close “small gaps that remain open from prior construction activities and remediating incomplete gates.”

In October 2023, the Biden administration allowed the additional building of border wall in Texas, with Biden saying he had to use money appropriated for the wall in 2019 and could not redirect it.

“I tried to get them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money. They didn’t, they wouldn’t. And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can’t stop that,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office at the time.

In response to questions from CNN, a Harris campaign aide said in referencing the recent campaign ad that it was “inaccurate to imply a few images” are “somehow representative of the VP’s overall policy position on a complex issue when the entirety of the ad, the VP’s remarks as the nominee, and the governance of this Administration have been clear where she stands on border security - supporting the bipartisan border agreement.”

Asylum shift

Along with extending funding for more border barriers and hiring more federal immigration authorities, the border security bill that Harris has vowed to sign as president would also largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. Many of the people who encounter Border Patrol agents at the southern border are migrants seeking asylum and claim to be fleeing conflict or persecution in their home country.

A CNN KFile review of Harris’ comments from 2017 through August 2020, before Biden picked her as his running mate, found that she repeatedly pledged to “honor the process” of asylum established decades ago and slammed policies that restricted asylum seekers.

Harris was one of seven US senators who signed onto an amicus brief in late 2018 supporting a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers challenging a Trump administration rule that effectively barred all asylum claims outside ports of entry.

“United States law is crystal clear that men, women, and children who arrive at any point on our borders may seek asylum,” read the brief. “In our democratic system, laws may not be overturned by Executive fiat.”

A judge struck down that rule in August 2019 and the Trump administration lost its appeals.

While running for president in 2019, Harris pledged to respect asylum law and called restricting asylum a “stain on our moral conscience.”

“Under a Harris administration, issues like asylum, for example, we are gonna honor the process and not try to circumvent the process and expedite the process for the sake of some political goal as opposed to the sake of justice and fairness,” Harris said on the “Pod Save America” podcast in 2019.

She reiterated the pledge in several tweets at that time, writing in July 2019, “As president, I will immediately put in place a meaningful process to review asylum cases. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. It’s time we had a president whose actions reflected the values of our country.”

During a June 2019 interview with CBS News, she vowed that a Harris administration would honor established asylum procedures, stating, “If they are deserving of protection, we will give it to ‘em.”

A year later, in June 2020, Harris was one of 34 senators to sign a congressional letter criticizing the Covid-era Title 42 authority, which allowed the government to bar migrants from entering the country because of the public health crisis. The letter equated Trump’s asylum policies to the denial of safe passage to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust.

Shortly after Biden and Harris took office in 2021, the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border significantly strained US immigration resources. The Biden-Harris administration initially kept Title 42 in place. In 2022, Republicans sued to keep the administration from ending Title 42, which it finally did in May 2023 when it announced the end of national Covid-era emergency restrictions.

As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration.

Despite this role, Harris’ current stance on asylum marks a notable departure from her earlier promises to uphold the asylum process and protect vulnerable migrants.

After Senate Republicans abandoned the border bill at the behest of Trump, the Biden administration took executive actions to restrict asylum. In June, Biden signed an executive order largely barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is reached, a departure from longstanding US asylum policy.

While Harris has yet to publicly comment on her plans for asylum, her campaign manager has signaled Harris would continue implementing Biden’s executive orders curbing asylum.

Repeatedly attacked the border wall

Throughout the Trump administration, Harris was a consistent critic of the border wall.

In April 2018, Harris signed onto a letter that urged the appropriations committee to reduce funding for the border wall and to halt hiring new Border Patrol agents.

CNN identified one of the border walls in her new campaign ads as constructed during Trump’s presidency in Sasabe, Arizona, in an area where there had not previously been border wall. The other walls feature signs that they were Trump-era walls, such as so-called anti-climbing plates that were built during the Trump years.

“It’s the president’s vanity project,” Harris said in June 2019 at an event promoting her book. “Let’s just point to the facts and the evidence and the data. And the fact is that we are not facing a crisis.”

“This president rode a wave into office of vilifying, a whole population of people,” she said at another event in 2019. “His multi-billion dollar vanity project called a wall is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that he actually hasn’t focused on working people in America. So instead of focusing on the needs of working families in America, he creates a scapegoat, a boogeyman.”

CNN —

Anyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states.

In 2020, Joe Biden turned a handful of states from red to blue to defeat then-President Donald Trump. The difference between victory and defeat was a tiny fraction of voters in those states.

In 2024, it could again be small margins in these few states that are the difference between another Trump Republican presidency or a win for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.

Trump will try to win those same states back from Democrats. The map could also change since the US population is shifting and both sides are hoping to bring a few more states into their respective column. In any event, the margins could be just as close.

But to say that a small number of voters “decide” the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved.

Here’s how things work:

There are 538 Electoral Collegevotes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation.

The smallest states get three (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more. California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts). Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on.

The winner is the candidate who gets 270 or more electoral votes. If no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives picks the winner from among the candidates who got electoral votes.

A dozen states were decided by 5 percentage points or less in either the 2016 or 2020 presidential election. In CNN’s 2024 race ratings, Maine is the only one of these states rated as solidly in one party’s corner, but one congressional district within Maine is seen as competitive. The other 11 states are seen as competitive in the 2024 election. See the ratings here.

Viewed another way, we can expect that those states where the previous elections have been close to be the ones where the 2024 election will again be close. Polling backs up this presumption.

In real numbers, the close margins in those relatively few states equal a very small number of voters in a country of more than 330 million people,but they are necessary for either candidate to reach an Electoral College count of 270. Some of those states came down to tens of thousands of votes. Biden won for Democrats in five states in 2020 – Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – where Hillary Clinton lost, often by very small margins, in 2016. Florida, on the other hand, which has been a battleground for years, went more toward Trump in 2020.

The campaigns will focus more attentionon the fewer than one-third of all electoral votes they consider to be up for grabs or winnable by either party.

Another thing to consider is that the number of electoral votes was reallocated after the 2020 election due to the every-10-years census required by the Constitution. North Carolina, Colorado and Florida, potential battlegrounds, each gained an electoral vote. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would become a battleground but which continues to tilt Republican despite shifting demographics, also gained two votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states that lost a vote.

That also means that the populations of these states are changing over time. A battleground in 2024 could look very different in the future. And states that seem safe for either party today could be battlegrounds in the future. For example, Virginia broke in Biden’s favor by about 10 points in 2020, but some polling this year has suggested a closer race there this time around.

Two states, Maine and Nebraska, apportion some oftheir electoral votes by congressional districtrather than giving all of them to the state winner. In 2020, for instance, Biden won a single vote in Nebraska and Trump won a single vote in Maine. These individual electoral votescould be incredibly important in the event of a tight election this year.

The end result is that, yes, the 2024election could again come down to relatively few voters in relatively few states.

But questions remain over who those decisive voters are. Are they the voters who make most states reliably red or blue in most elections? Are they suburban women who were turned off by Trump in 2020, or are they people without a college degree who have moved toward the GOP? Are they minority voters or women energized by the first woman of color to be this close to the Oval Office? Are they older voters who have been trending toward Democrats or younger voters expressing an interest in Republicans? Are they more disinterested voters who only take part in the process every now and then, or is it a question of which party successfully motivates its stalwarts to turn out no matter what?

It will take all of the above for either candidate to win. However, because the margins in certain states could be so small, incremental shifts in the preference or turnout of any larger group of voters could be decisive.

This headline and story have been updated with additional information."

politics,"Where Harris has, and has not, rebuilt the Democratic coalition",2024-08-20,Ronald Brownstein,"The Harris coalition is coming into focus.

When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee last month, her twin challenges were to shore up support with the groups where Biden was weak and to maintain his standing with the groups where he was relatively stronger.

As she arrives at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week, a broad array of polls testify to her progress on both tests. In both national and battleground state surveys, she’s regained a solid amount of the ground that Biden had lost with such traditionally Democratic-leaning groups as Black and younger voters, and made a more modest recovery with Latinos.

Simultaneously, in both national polls and surveys of the critical Rustbelt battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, she is matching or exceeding Biden’s showing among older and working-class Whites — two groups in which Biden had largely maintained his 2020 level of support before quitting the race.

Harris’ performance on each of these fronts has allowed her to pass former President Donald Trump in most polling averages measuring each candidates’ overall national support. More importantly, it has reopened the electoral map, providing her more pathways to 270 Electoral College votes than Biden had before he left the race. Her gains among younger and non-White voters have allowed her to put back into play Sunbelt battlegrounds that Biden’s struggles among those voters had moved largely beyond his reach. And in the Rustbelt battlegrounds that represented Biden’s most plausible path to 270 Electoral College votes, Harris looks stronger than the president did because she’s gaining there too among younger and non-White voters while running at least as well as he did among Whites.

But in the Rustbelt and Sunbelt alike, formidable challenges remain to this emerging “Kamala coalition.” Although Harris has demonstrably regained ground with younger, Black and Latino voters, in most polls she still lags below the levels Biden reached with them in 2020. It’s far from certain Harris can win any of the major Sunbelt battlegrounds — North Carolina and Georgia in the Southeast, Arizona and Nevada in the Southwest — unless she can come even closer to those previous Democratic benchmarks. And the remaining voters she needs may be tougher to corral than those that have already returned to her.

In the industrial states, she faces the challenge of defending the beachheads she’s established with working-class and older Whites, who comprise a much larger share of the vote in these places than in the Sunbelt battlegrounds. These White voters without a college degree will likely be the most receptive audience to the GOP arguments that Harris is soft on crime and immigration, and an extreme “woke” cultural liberal.

Mark Graul, a veteran GOP operative in Wisconsin, predicted that Harris’ support with these voters will erode as Republicans bombard them with advertising. “I think the surveys we are seeing right now are at or near her peak” with blue-collar White voters, he said. “If the Trump campaign does its job … that kind of messaging is going to drive those working-class White voters who may have been open to the excitement of ‘Hey, we got rid of Biden and I don’t like either of those guys’ to jump back [to Donald Trump].”

Yet it is significant that more working-class voters did not immediately move back to Trump in polls when Democrats replaced their 81-year-old White male nominee with a younger woman who would be the first Black woman and Indian American president. That suggests Harris’ race and gender do not render her intrinsically unacceptable to a larger group of these working-class Whites than the share that find it difficult to support any Democrat. That doesn’t mean Republicans ultimately can’t peel away more of those voters from her; but it does mean they will have to dislodge them, voter by voter, with their arguments and ads, rather than benefiting from an instinctive recoil to a woman of color nominee.

For now, polls generally show Harris generating at least as much support among working-class White voters as Biden did, both in his 2020 race and the polling before he left the 2024 race.

Biden didn’t run great with working-class White voters in 2020, but he did improve a few points over Hillary Clinton’s performance in 2016, reaching about one-third of their vote, according to the exit polls and the Pew Research Center’s well-respected validated voters study. Most significantly, the exit polls found that Biden gained over Clinton among them in Michigan and Wisconsin (where he carried about two-fifths of them) and Pennsylvania (where he won about one-third). That improvement, combined with a parallel uptick in support from college-educated White voters, allowed him to recapture all three states, after Trump in 2016 had dislodged them from what I called the “blue wall” — the 18 states that voted Democratic in each presidential election from 1992 through 2012.

Amid all his other problems this year, polls had shown Biden largely holding as much support among these blue-collar White voters as he did in his first contest with Trump. Harris today looks even a bit stronger. National surveys released in August by Marquette Law School, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist and Fox News Channel each showed her drawing 36-40% of non-college White voters, a share higher than Biden’s in 2020 and back in the range of Barack Obama’s performance in 2008 and 2012. (The Washington Post/ABC/Ipsos poll released Sunday did not find Harris quite as strong, but still reported her slightly surpassing Biden’s performance among Whites without degrees.) New York Times/Siena College surveys found her matching or beating Biden’s 2020 showing in the exit polls with non-college educated Whites in each of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; another round of surveys from those pollsters released last weekend found her beating Biden’s share with those blue-collar Whites in North Carolina and Georgia, and exactly equaling them in Arizona and Nevada.

White men without a college degree could be an especially difficult audience for Harris, but many Democrats are hopeful she can remain competitive in these communities overall by maintaining relatively strong support among blue-collar White women. Both Biden and Hillary Clinton won only about 35% of them in the exit polls. But Democrats see an opportunity to improve on that since many of those women support legal abortion. With the concerns about Biden’s age and capability eliminated as a factor, Democrats also hope that more of those women may feel free to express their unease about Trump’s character and behavior: in a recent national New York Times/Siena poll, almost exactly half of White women without a college degree said they did not believe Trump had the temperament to succeed as president, according to detailed results provided by Siena.

Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster with long experience in Wisconsin, argues that defending Harris against the GOP’s culturally based attacks on issues like crime and immigration aimed at these working-class White women is imperative for her campaign. Harris’ vulnerability to Republican attacks overall is less “than Biden had,” Maslin said. “But we are dreaming if we don’t think there is still some vulnerability. They have much better ground that they are going to get to here.”

Support for legal abortion and distaste for Trump’s behavior and leadership style could also allow Harris to expand on Biden’s already substantial margins among White women with at least a four-year college degree. It’s easy to forget that the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices overturned the constitutional right to abortion only after the 2020 election, when Biden already carried between 54-59% of college-educated White women, according to the major data sources. With abortion more politically relevant now than then, Harris has a good chance to exceed those numbers in 2024, many strategists in both parties believe.

Conversely, she will be challenged to preserve Biden’s 2020 support among college-educated White men, who are a receptive group for Trump’s arguments that, as a business executive, he can better manage the economy. But if she can avoid, or at least minimize, erosion with those men (who split almost evenly in 2020), she will be strongly positioned to improve over Biden’s 2020 showing with all college-educated Whites. Already the Marquette, Marist and Fox national polls, and the New York Times/Siena survey across the three big Rustbelt battlegrounds all showed her on track to exceed Biden’s 2020 showing with these voters. Running that well among college-educated White voters in places such as the suburbs of Philadelphia and Milwaukee, Oakland County outside Detroit, and Madison, Wisconsin, could allow her to survive some erosion compared to Biden in 2020 among Whites without a degree and still hold those three states.

While matching Biden’s relative strength among White voters is central to Harris’ prospects in the Rustbelt, reversing his weaknesses with younger and diverse voters is the key to her chances in the Sunbelt. Harris has also made progress on that task. But on this part of her test, her grade is more clearly an incomplete.

Over the past few weeks, surveys by Democratic operatives, or groups allied with the party, have all found Harris improving notably over Biden’s showing before he left the race with such core party constituencies as Latinos, young people, Black men and single women. But in each case, the surveys still showed her lagging Biden’s level of support with those groups in 2020. The recent New York Times/Siena surveys likewise showed Harris moving back past 80% among Black voters in both the industrial Midwest and Southeast but still lagging the roughly 90% or more Biden won last time in all those states. These polls also found Harris matching Biden’s 2020 share among Latinos in Arizona, but still substantially underperforming in Nevada.

Page Gardner, a veteran strategist for progressive groups, who sponsored the work on single women, explained their continued dip in support from 2020 by citing factors that are relevant to all the Democratic-leaning groups that had drifted away from Biden. The problem, Gardner said, starts with “economic factors – prices, with housing a particularly acute concern.” But the shortfall extends to a broader sense that the Biden years have not produced as much progress as these voters expected. “Although excitement and motivation has increased, there is an underlying sense of discouragement regarding things actually changing for them,” Gardner said. “Like so many others in the electorate, majorities of these women feel like they are losing power.”

Polling by Equis Research, a Democratic firm that recently conducted an in-depth survey of Latinos across the battleground states, found Harris gaining among both Latino women and men, but still running much better among the former than the latter. Carlos Odio, the Equis co-founder and senior vice president for research, said he believes Harris eventually could equal or surpass Biden’s 2020 Latino performance, but acknowledges she remains below that level now in the group’s polling.

“She clearly has gotten a good will boost; people like her; people like that she represents a change; they generally have good feelings about her,” he said. “But especially for the voters who are still up for grabs, they are waiting to see what more she has to say on the economy.”

While “her entrance answers a lot of voters’ demands for something other than [the choices] they had before,” Odio added, “there’s always a concern with an unknown quantity: What do they represent, does she have any wacky views? I think a lot of what you are going to see from this campaign is reassurance.”

On Monday, the Black Men Vote PAC released a survey that likewise found Harris gaining across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with the men they focus on but Trump still roughly matching his improved performance with them in 2020, and showing the potential for even greater gains with younger men. “These findings indicate that there is still work to be done to secure the full support of this critical voter bloc,” the group said in a release announcing the results.

With young people, the story is similar. While surveys had often found Biden consistently underperforming vs. Trump among younger voters, the latest national and state polls generally show Harris restoring a solid advantage with them. But, as with the other groups, most surveys did not yet show her matching Biden’s roughly 3-in-5 support last time among adults younger than 30.

On a recent episode of The Daily Blast podcast with Greg Sargent, John Della Volpe, a Harvard Kennedy School expert on youth voting who is advising a super PAC trying to build support among young people for Democrats, said a recent poll he conducted found Harris drawing just over half of younger voters against Trump, after the former president stunningly led Biden with them in the group’s previous survey. “I don’t think that she would be comfortable with [that] margin a month or two months from now, honestly,” Della Volpe said. “This needs to get somewhere into the mid-50s, which … is what I think is required to feel comfortable about an Electoral College victory in November.”

The recent swing state polls released by a bipartisan team of pollsters for the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter underscored how these shifts have moved Harris back into contention, but hardly into a safe position, across the battlegrounds. The surveys found Harris numerically ahead of Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, tied in Georgia and numerically behind only in Nevada. In May, Cook’s polling found Trump ahead or tied with Biden in all seven states.

Patrick Toomey, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with a GOP partner, said gains with a broad range of groups had propelled Harris past Trump. “Harris is in a stronger position than Biden was in May because her candidacy has won over a mix of non-college White voters in Rust Belt States … and college-educated Whites in the Sun Belt while posting gains among Black women and Latina voters across” all the states, he said.

Still, like the polling by Democratic groups, the Cook battleground state surveys showed Harris underperforming with Black, Latino and young voters. Harris ran no better among Latino and Black men across the battleground states than Biden did in May, Toomey said. These trends leave the battleground states within reach for Trump, if he can discipline himself to mount a cohesive campaign against Harris as too liberal and inexperienced, argued Greg Strimple, the Republican pollster on the Cook survey. “There is a path for Trump,” Strimple said. “It’s just whether he can take it.”

Harris’ gains have virtually eradicated one previously critical category in the race: the heralded “double haters” who disliked both Trump and Biden. Multiple surveys, such as recent national polls by the Pew Research Center, ABC/Washington Post and Monmouth College, as well as Equis’ survey of Latino voters, have found that there are far fewer “double hater” voters negative on both Harris and Trump than there were voters negative on both Biden and Trump. That decline reflects Harris’ success at winning back many from the large pool of Democratic-leaning voters who could not support another Biden term.

“These were Democratic voters that we’ve lost,” said Stanley Greenberg, the long-time Democratic pollsters. “They are people that were voting strongly Democratic and had been alienated by inflation, and Biden just couldn’t get a hearing with them. Most of her gains have come from people who have been leaning into voting Democratic and want to see her succeed.”

Harris’ success at recapturing these Democratic-leaning younger, single and non-White voters alienated from Biden while holding his beachhead among older and working-class Whites has created a coalition strong enough to contest all the major battlegrounds, after many of them seemed already lost to Trump. But the continued limits on her support on both sides of this ledger means she isn’t guaranteed victory in any of the pivotal states.

“The trajectory before Biden’s withdrawal is that it looked very likely Donald Trump was going to be elected to a second term,” said Bryan Bennett, the senior director of polling and analytics at the Hub Project, a progressive organization. “Harris entering the equation has returned the race to a jump ball.”

That’s an inherently precarious position. But compared to their situation just one month ago, the Democrats gathering in Chicago this week will take those odds in a heartbeat."
politics,"Where Harris has, and has not, rebuilt the Democratic coalition",2024-08-20,Ronald Brownstein,"The Harris coalition is coming into focus.

When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee last month, her twin challenges were to shore up support with the groups where Biden was weak and to maintain his standing with the groups where he was relatively stronger.

As she arrives at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week, a broad array of polls testify to her progress on both tests. In both national and battleground state surveys, she’s regained a solid amount of the ground that Biden had lost with such traditionally Democratic-leaning groups as Black and younger voters, and made a more modest recovery with Latinos.

Simultaneously, in both national polls and surveys of the critical Rustbelt battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, she is matching or exceeding Biden’s showing among older and working-class Whites — two groups in which Biden had largely maintained his 2020 level of support before quitting the race.

Harris’ performance on each of these fronts has allowed her to pass former President Donald Trump in most polling averages measuring each candidates’ overall national support. More importantly, it has reopened the electoral map, providing her more pathways to 270 Electoral College votes than Biden had before he left the race. Her gains among younger and non-White voters have allowed her to put back into play Sunbelt battlegrounds that Biden’s struggles among those voters had moved largely beyond his reach. And in the Rustbelt battlegrounds that represented Biden’s most plausible path to 270 Electoral College votes, Harris looks stronger than the president did because she’s gaining there too among younger and non-White voters while running at least as well as he did among Whites.

But in the Rustbelt and Sunbelt alike, formidable challenges remain to this emerging “Kamala coalition.” Although Harris has demonstrably regained ground with younger, Black and Latino voters, in most polls she still lags below the levels Biden reached with them in 2020. It’s far from certain Harris can win any of the major Sunbelt battlegrounds — North Carolina and Georgia in the Southeast, Arizona and Nevada in the Southwest — unless she can come even closer to those previous Democratic benchmarks. And the remaining voters she needs may be tougher to corral than those that have already returned to her.

politics,Jessica Leeds: Trump accuser said she ‘laughed out loud’ when she heard him again deny her assault allegation,2024-09-09,"Jack Forrest, Kara Scannell","Jessica Leeds, who previously accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and was a trial witness in a high-profile case against the former president, said Monday that she “laughed out loud” when she heard he recently disputed her allegation and said she “would not have been the chosen one.”

“I laughed out loud. I couldn’t believe that he was using that word like some sort of cult figure,” Leeds told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.”

Leeds was one of the first women to come forward during the 2016 presidential campaign to allege that Trump sexually assaulted her. She said she was seated in first class on an airplane next to Trump in the 1970s when he suddenly began groping her. Leeds said she fought off Trump and moved to the back of the airplane.

“I was not the first, of course I was not the last. But there have been enough so that he doesn’t remember,” Leeds told Cooper Monday.

Asked about Leeds’ comments, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung again denied Trump had ever met Leeds and said that “whatever fable she’s trying to peddle is only meant to interfere in the election and distract from” Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival.

Leeds had been called to testify during Trump’s sexual abuse and defamation trial last year brought by E. Jean Carroll, who accused the former president of assaulting her in a luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996. She was one of two women Carroll’s lawyers called to allege Trump had a modus operandi of sexually assaulting women and then attacking their appearance and credibility when the allegations became public.

A jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation when in 2019 he denied Carroll’s allegation, said she wasn’t his type, and claimed that she made up the assault to sell copies of a book. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages.

Trump is appealing the verdict.

During oral arguments before a panel of judges on Friday, Trump’s attorneys questioned the admissibility of Leeds’ testimony, claiming it wasn’t a federal crime in the 1970s to sexually abuse a woman on an airplane. Carroll’s lawyer said “simple assault” was illegal on an airplane at the time.

Trump, following the hearing, lashed out at Leeds and several other women who have accused him of sexual assault, saying her claim was a “totally made up story” and said she was a “big Clinton person.”

“Now, I assume she’ll sue me now for defamation, like I got sued by E. Jean Carroll,” the former president said.

Leeds, addressing reporters at a news conference in front of Trump Tower earlier Monday, said that “it’s important to remind the voters of Trump’s disrespect of women,” adding: “He assaulted me 50 years ago and continues to attack me today.”

Asked by Cooper whether she’ll pursue legal action against Trump related to his latest comments, Leeds said that “we’re leaving all of our options open.”

“But no, my goal when I was asked to testify at E. Jean’s trial was to establish that this is his behavior, longstanding, and I have nothing to gain from it,” she said.

Earlier this year a separate jury found Trump defamed Carroll when in 2022 he repeated several of the statements he initially made in 2019. The jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million. Her attorneys argued to the jury that the only way to stop Trump from repeating the statements was to hit him in his pocketbook.

politics,"RFK Jr. to remain on ballot in Michigan, state Supreme Court rules",2024-09-09,"Aaron Pellish, Kit Maher","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be on the ballot in Michigan, the state’s highest court ruled Monday, despite Kennedy pushing to have his name removed after he ended his independent presidential campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump.

The state Supreme Court court said in its majority opinion that Kennedy “has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief” after seeking to have his name removed from the ballot, reversing a Michigan appeals court decision to take him off the ballot Friday after an appeal from the Michigan secretary of state.

Kennedy had qualified for the battleground state’s ballot after being nominated by the Natural Law Party, a minor party with ballot access in Michigan. In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Welch cited Natural Law Party chair Doug Dern’s opposition to Kennedy’s withdrawal four months after his party nominated Kennedy as part of her basis for concluding Kennedy did not have a “clear right” to be removed from the state’s ballot.

The decision undercuts Kennedy’s hope to push his supporters toward Trump after he endorsed the former president last month. Kennedy has been attempting to remove his name from battleground states as part of a strategy to maximize the Republican nominee’s support in places that could determine the outcome of the election. Last week, he told his supporters to back Trump “no matter what state you live in.”

While Kennedy’s support was in single digits when he dropped out of the presidential race last month, those voters could prove consequential to the outcome of closely contested states like Michigan. In a CNN poll released last week of likely voters in Michigan, Kennedy received 4% support despite having suspended his campaign. In that same poll, Vice President Kamala Harris led in Michigan with 48% over Trump’s 43%.

Kennedy has seen some success in his effort to be removed from the ballot in battleground states, with the North Carolina Supreme Court ruling in his favor Monday.

The Michigan ruling settles a hard-fought legal effort by Kennedy to remove his name from the state ballot, after initially losing a Michigan Court of Claims decision. He then appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which ruled in his favor to remove him from the ballot Friday before that decision was overturned on Monday.

A spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson praised the state Supreme Court’s quick ruling in a statement, saying, “Clerks can now move forward with the ballot printing process to ensure absentee ballots will be delivered to voters by the federal deadlines.”

Absentee voting in Michigan is scheduled to start September 26, although ballots for overseas and military voters are required to go out by September 21.

politics,Trump campaign and JD Vance promote false rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets,2024-09-09,Michael Williams,"Several prominent Republicans, including the party’s vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, promoted false claims on Monday that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets.

It’s the latest turn in a campaign that has increasingly embraced race-baiting messaging, questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity while seeking to undermine her immigration policies.

The rumors center on the Ohio city of Springfield, which has experienced a surge in recent migration from Haitians seeking to escape a Caribbean country that has been rocked from years of natural disasters, political assassinations and gang rule.

A post in a Springfield Facebook group recently claimed a neighbor’s daughter’s friend found their missing cat hanging from a branch at a Haitian neighbor’s home, and it was being prepped to be eaten, according to the Springfield News-Sun. Those rumors were picked up by conservative media and then spread on X, where they gained widespread traction on Monday.

“President Trump will deport migrants who eat pets,” a Trump campaign account posted to X. “Kamala Harris will send them to your town next. Make your choice, America.”

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posted a meme showing two kittens embracing. Text overlaid on the image reads: “Please vote for Trump so Haitian immigrants don’t eat us.”

Vance posted a video of himself discussing migration to Ohio at a recent hearing. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country. Where is our border czar?” Some accounts shared AI-generated pictures of Trump holding a cat in his hands while being chased by crowds of Black men.

The unsubstantiated claims appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. They spread widely on X, whose owner, Elon Musk, has embraced the false rumors and posted several memes that promoted them.

Some accounts posted body-worn camera footage from an incident they said bolstered their claims. But that footage was shot in Canton, Ohio, which is more than 170 miles away from Springfield.

In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.”

Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Haitian American who represents a district in South Florida, called both Vance and Cruz “disgusting” when asked about the rumors they helped spread Monday.

“And I say that be﻿cause these are senators who are educated men, they have enough common sense to actually look into the issue and find out if it’s true, and they have a responsibility not to be spreading lies,” said Cherfilus-McCormick.

“So I think that’s a disgusting thing to do, especially when you’re in such a high office, to intentionally spread these lies,” she added. She said the actions of Vance and Cruz were especially disappointing because both senators have immigrants in their own lives; Cruz is the son of a Cuban immigrant, while Vance is the son-in-law of Indian immigrants.

In a FAQ section on its website, the city said there are an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants in the county that includes Springfield. Haitian immigrants are in the city legally under the Immigration Parole Program as they apply for temporary protected status, the city said.

Asked for comment Monday, a spokesperson for Vance said the senator had “received a high volume of calls and emails over the past several weeks from concerned citizens in Springfield” and added that Vance’s “tweet is based on what he is hearing from them.”

“Many residents have contacted Senator Vance to share their concerns over crime and traffic accidents, and to express that they no longer feel safe in their own homes,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the liberal media, JD takes his constituents’ concerns seriously.”

Spokespeople for Cruz did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The Monday rumor mill is the latest time the Trump campaign has sought to stoke racial animus. Trump himself has repeatedly questioned the racial identity of Harris, falsely claiming she has only recently begun presenting herself as Black. Harris has long claimed being Black as part of her identity, attended a historically Black college and pledged to a historically Black sorority. Harris has largely declined to engage Trump’s claims about her race.

Haitians are an especially crucial voting bloc in Florida – a formerly politically purple state which then became staunchly red, but which the Biden and now Harris campaigns have believed could be in play.

A portion of the Haitian diaspora community votes Republican, said Cherfilus-McCormick, but they – along with other immigrant diaspora communities in Florida – might be “pushed away” by the rumors some Republicans have embraced, she said.

“I would expect this from somebody or people who had no connection to immigrant families, someone who didn’t know how hard we work and how we really push forward,” she said. “That’s who I would expect it from, but not from, you know, the son of an immigrant, nor someone who’s married into a family where you see the hard work we do every single day.”

politics,Speaker Mike Johnson’s government funding plan already crumbling with at least 6 GOP no votes,2024-09-09,"Annie Grayer, Manu Raju, Lauren Fox","Washington CNN —

House Speaker Mike Johnson’s government funding plan is already crumbling with enough Republicans opposed to the resolution to sink it, and more warning the speaker will have to abandon his initial proposal to keep the government open.

At least six House Republicans have said they are against Johnson’s plan to attach a controversial bill to bar noncitizens from voting in US elections to a six-month government funding resolution, enough GOP opposition to block Johnson’s proposal given the party’s narrow margin in the House and that the proposal lacks support from Democrats.

GOP Reps. Greg Steube of Florida, Cory Mills of Florida, Jim Banks of Indiana, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Matt Rosendale of Montana have all come out against the plan – known as a continuing resolution, or CR – that is scheduled to be voted on Wednesday.

Steube told CNN, “I have never voted for a CR, and I don’t plan to moving forward.”

Banks echoed, “I voted against the omnibus. I’m not going to vote to extend bloated spending for six more months, to grow the national debt trillions of dollars more in debt. So it’s an easy no vote for me.”

Mills said Monday he informed the House GOP leadership team “I will be a no.”

While Massie and Rosendale posted statements declaring their opposition to Johnson’s proposal.

Several other hardliners told CNN that they have not decided if they will support the package, or vote no. Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said that he is “undecided,” while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said that she needs to talk to the speaker and see if he is really committed to insisting that the SAVE Act will be included in the deal.

“What is Speaker Johnson going to do? Is he willing to fight for this? And if he’s not willing to fight for it, why, why would we vote for it?” she asked.

“He needs to commit to us. Because, you know, conservatives like me, we have, we will not vote for a CR unless we know that we have a speaker, if we have a leader that is actually going to go to battle,” Greene said. “Otherwise, … it’s pointless. It’s really a waste of everyone’s time.”

To her GOP colleagues voicing opposition to Johnson’s plan, GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York told CNN, “Look, I don’t support everything. I mean, there were parts of the budget that I voted against in the past. But do we really want to be debating whether the government should be open before the election? I think we have the responsibility to ensure that it’s funded.”

Other Republicans who support Johnson’s plan say that lawmakers should be on the record explaining why they are opposed to the bill that would bar noncitizens from voting in US elections. It is already illegal for non-citizens to vote.

After GOP lawmakers started to voice their opposition to his proposal, Johnson appeared less confident in the prospects of his plan passing, telling CNN on Monday night, “We will find out” if it will pass when it is scheduled for a vote on Wednesday.

“We will have some more conversations tonight,” the Louisiana Republican added. “I am very confident in the principle of what we are doing and hopefully it will get across,” Johnson said.

Just hours earlier, Johnson was singing a different tune.

“Let’s see if they have the guts to tell the American people they want illegals to vote in these elections,” Johnson told CNN earlier on Monday about the Senate.

Pressed further, Johnson maintained, “There is no fallback position. This is a righteous fight.”

In a closed-door meeting on Monday with his leadership team, Johnson went even further.

“He made it really clear that this is the plan, this is what we are going with, he’s not going to entertain anything else,” GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan said of Johnson’s posture in the meeting. “This is his line in the sand.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has said Johnson’s proposal is a nonstarter with House Democrats, said Monday night, They “will not bend the knee to the extreme MAGA Republican effort to cut funding veterans, military readiness and senior citizens throughout America.”

Five House Democrats have previously voted for the controversial bill to bar noncitizens from voting in US elections that Johnson has attached to his government funding proposal, but it’s still unclear how the caucus will approach the vote this week.

Other Republicans say Johnson will ultimately have to abandon his initial proposal to keep the government open and instead put a clean extension of government funding on the floor, as this Congress has previously done to avert shutdowns.

GOP Rep. Mike Garcia of California told CNN that he anticipates Johnson’s plan will be scrapped and the government will ultimately be funded with a simple clean extension.

“If history is any lesson than the trajectory of this thing would suggest that we will at some point be either voting on a government shutdown or a clean” continuing resolution, he said.

And Garcia said he wants those intermediary steps to be more apparent.

“I want to see more detail,” Garcia told CNN. “I want to see what the follow up plan is. You know the devil is in the details. I don’t like that it’s a six-month CR. I don’t like that we don’t know sort of plan B, plan C, what step two, step three are. So I want to have those discussions within the conference.”

GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he supports Johnson’s plan but predicted it would not be the final version: “He may have more cards up his sleeve than I know.”

Given the opposition so far, GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state said, “There’s people coming out against it, so not sure what plan B will be.”

House GOP Whip Tom Emmer would not say if he thought House Republicans will ultimately stick together and pass their version of the funding package.

“Well, we’ll see. It’s the speaker’s priority. He’s leaning into it hard. We’re going to whip it, see where we’re at,” Emmer told reporters.

politics,Police are questioning Florida voters about signing an abortion rights ballot petition,2024-09-09,"Katherine Dautrich, Associated Press","Tallahassee, Florida AP —

State police are showing up at Florida voters’ homes to question them about signing a petition to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in November, and a state health care agency has launched a website targeting the ballot initiative with politically charged language.

Critics say they’re the latest efforts by Florida’s Republican elected officials to leverage state resources to try to block the abortion rights measure, moves which some Democratic officials argue could violate state laws against voter intimidation.

“Ron (DeSantis) has repeatedly used state power to interfere with a citizen-led process to get reproductive freedom on the ballot,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried told reporters Monday. “This is their latest desperate attempt before Election Day.”

The ballot initiative known as Amendment 4 would enshrine abortion rights in Florida law. If approved by 60% of voters, the procedure would remain legal until the fetus is viable, as determined by the patient’s health care provider.

Isaac Menasche, one of nearly a million people who signed the petition to get the measure on the ballot, said a law enforcement officer knocked on his door last week in Lee County in southwest Florida to ask him about signing it.

The officer said the questioning was part of an investigation into alleged petition fraud, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

“I’m not a person who is going out there protesting for abortion,” Menasche told the newspaper. “I just felt strongly, and I took the opportunity when the person asked me to say, ‘Yeah, I’ll sign that petition.’”

Critics say the investigation is a brazen attempt to intimidate voters in the country’s third-largest state from protecting access to abortion — and the latest in a series of efforts by Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration to target Amendment 4.

“Amendment 4 was placed on the ballot by nearly one million Floridians around the state and across party lines who believe that people, not politicians, deserve the freedom to make their own health care decisions,” Lauren Brenzel, the director of the Yes on 4 campaign, said in an email. “But the State will stop at nothing to keep in place their near-total abortion ban.”

Florida law currently bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant.

Speaking at a press event Monday in South Florida, DeSantis defended police visiting the homes of petition signers, and a separate move by a state health care agency to create a website targeting the ballot amendment, saying both are aimed at making sure November’s vote is fair.

DeSantis signed a law in 2022 creating a state police force dedicated to investigating voter fraud and elections crimes. Voter fraud is rare, typically occurs in isolated instances and is generally detected.

He said elections police are going to the homes of people who signed the petitions that got Amendment 4 on the ballot not to intimidate them, but because questions have been raised about the legitimacy of the signatures. He said the police have found evidence that some of the supposed signatures were from dead people.

“Anyone who submitted a petition that is a valid voter, that is totally within their rights to do it,” DeSantis said. “We are not investigating that. What they are investigating is fraudulent petitions. We know that this group did submit on behalf of dead people.”

A deadline in state law to challenge the validity of the signatures has long passed, but county-level election administrators across Florida say they have been receiving requests from state officials to turn over verified petition signatures as part of a state probe.

Mary Jane Arrington, a Democrat who has served as the supervisor of elections in Osceola County in central Florida for 16 years, told The Associated Press she had never received a request like this one before.

Arrington said she didn’t know what to make of the state’s request to review signatures her office had already verified.

“These are ones that we deemed the petition valid, both in completeness and in their signature matching what we had on file for the voter,” Arrington said. “They said they were investigating … signature petition fraud.”

The state’s elections crime unit has opened more than 40 investigations into paid petition gathers working for the Amendment 4 campaign, according to a letter that Deputy Secretary of State Brad McVay sent to the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections that was shared with the AP.

Judges have tossed out previous criminal cases brought by the controversial Office of Election Crimes and Security.

Meanwhile, a state health care agency launched a new website last week targeting Amendment 4, with a landing page proclaiming that “Florida is Protecting Life” and warning, “Don’t let the fearmongers lie to you.”

DeSantis said the page created by Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration is being paid through a budget the department has to do public service announcements. He said the page is not political but is giving Floridians “factual information” about the amendment.

“Everything that is put out is factual. It is not electioneering,” DeSantis said at the news conference, adding, “I am glad they are doing it.”

Florida is one of a number of states where measures to protect abortion access have qualified to go before voters in 2024.

Florida Republicans have been using various other strategies to thwart the state abortion ballot measure. Republican Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody attempted to use the state Supreme Court to keep abortion off the ballot. Later, abortion rights advocates criticized a financial impact statement meant to be placed on the ballot beside the proposed amendment as an attempt to mislead voters. The state Supreme Court ruled in August to allow the language to remain on the ballot.

Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups and GOP allies across the country are using an array of strategies to counter proposed ballot initiatives aiming to protect reproductive rights. These tactics have included legislative pushes for competing ballot measures that could confuse voters and monthslong delays caused by lawsuits over ballot initiative language.

Nebraskans, for example, are awaiting rulings from the state Supreme Court on three lawsuits aimed at keeping abortion off the ballot. And the Missouri Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Tuesday in an appeal of a lower court ruling that an abortion rights campaign did not meet legal requirements to qualify for the November ballot."
politics,Here’s what the conversation around Harris and Trump looks like among Americans ahead of the debate,2024-09-09,Jennifer Agiesta,"Across the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s presidential debate, the news Americans have been hearing, reading and seeing about Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has continued shuffling, with the topics that resonate about each candidate shifting week to week.

That’s a change from the past two presidential campaigns. Results of similar surveys in 2016 and 2020 found that the news and information that broke through to Americans about at least one candidate in those elections were consistently dominated by one issue throughout the course of the campaign – emails around Hillary Clinton in 2016 and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic for Trump in 2020. This time around, there hasn’t been any such dominant issue for either candidate since CNN began tracking these results in mid-June.

That’s the key takeaway from the latest round of data from The Breakthrough, a collaborative research project from CNN, the University of Michigan and Georgetown University, conducted by research firms SSRS and Verasight. The surveys, which collect responses from a new group of roughly 1,000 representative Americans each week, run each Friday through Monday.

Data collected around the time of the Democratic National Convention showed the party’s gathering driving the campaign conversation around Harris that week, with those reporting they had heard about the Democratic conclave using more positive words about it than those who’d heard about the Republican Party’s convention in July had done at the time.

And through the Labor Day weekend, discussion of Harris focused largely on the interview she did with CNN, her first major sit-down since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org

For Trump, by contrast, the most recent data reveals a spike in mentions of news about his appearance at Arlington National Cemetery, during which his campaign ignored a cemetery official’s calls not to film the former president in a section that is reserved for those who lost their lives in recent military action. Mentions of “abortion” also crack the top five for Trump this week, the only policy-related word to do so since the survey began, aside from mentions of “Project 2025” in mid-July.

The spike in responses around a single topic marks a departure from recent trend around Trump in the Breakthrough data. The conversation around Trump’s campaign in the time after his party’s convention in mid-July and up through the end of the Democratic convention in late August was notable for its lack of a dominant theme or focus on a single new development. Americans reporting they had heard about Trump’s campaign were using a range of words, with the most common focused on the day-to-day of a presidential run. There were roughly twice as many mentions of “Arlington” alone in the most recent data as there were mentions in the preceding week of “campaign,” that week’s most commonly used word.

These campaign-related words are still a frequent feature of Americans’ reports about what they’ve heard about Trump, but in the most recent data, they are joined by news about his Arlington visit. In survey data collected in the days after the Democratic convention, 25% of respondents mentioned something related to Trump’s campaign activity, with the next most frequently mentioned topic (opinions about Trump) at 9% of all mentions. In the most recent data, 24% mention something related to campaigning, with 17% saying something that touches on the Arlington visit or the controversy around it.

Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org

Overall sentiment in Americans’ reports of what they have seen, read or heard about each of the candidates has been consistently more positive for Harris than for Trump, though for both, recent trends suggest at least somewhat more negative sentiment than positive. Over the past two weeks, Harris’ numbers climbed into net positive territory around the DNC and then settled back to their pre-convention level in the week after. Harris appears to have received a larger boost on this metric from the Democratic convention in Chicago than Trump did from the Republican gathering in Milwaukee.

Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org

Comparing the data collected shortly after the DNC with that collected just after the Republican National Convention, there is a notable difference in tone overall. While the bulk of the responses mentioning that someone had heard something about each convention were neutral, those who did express a sentiment were far more positive toward Harris after the DNC than they were toward Trump after the RNC.

Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org

News about Trump’s convention was largely overshadowed in the public’s view by news about the assassination attempt against him shortly before the convention began: 61% of respondents mentioned that in the week after Trump’s convention, compared with 23% who mentioned something about the convention. For Harris, though, the convention was by far the most frequently mentioned topic of its moment: About 40% of respondents mentioned something convention-related, nearly twice as much as the next most frequently cited topic that week, her campaign at 21%.

Around 7 in 10 Americans in the most recent poll reported hearing some news about each of the two major candidates, about the same as during each of the previous two weeks. The upcoming debate could prompt a shift in those numbers though: Shortly after the first presidential debate in late June, the share reporting that they had heard something about Trump climbed from 77% to 83%, with the share saying they’d heard news about Joe Biden rising from 71% to 83%. (Biden dropped out of the race the following month and endorsed Harris.)

That latest data also marks a spike in attention to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as he ended his independent bid for the presidency and threw his support behind Trump. Over the past two weeks, about 6 in 10 Americans reported having heard something about Kennedy, higher than at any point since The Breakthrough began tracking impressions of the race in late June. Overall, 61% said they had heard something about Kennedy in the most recent week, 20 points above his pre-dropout high mark of 41%.

Demonstrating the limited impact his campaign had on the national conversation around the presidential race, over the entire course of the survey, there were more mentions of dropping out for Kennedy than any other word.

politics,Justice Kagan reinforces her support for enforceable ethics code at Supreme Court,2024-09-09,John Fritze,"New York CNN —

Justice Elena Kagan pushed back on Monday against critics of an enforceable code of ethics for the Supreme Court, telling an audience in New York that it would help ensure confidence in an institution that polls show has lost the trust of many Americans.

“It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that we comply with our own code of conduct going forward in the future,” the liberal justice said an event at the New York University School of Law. “It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we’re doing exactly that. So it seems like a salutary thing for the court.”

Kagan embraced the general idea of an enforceable ethics code in July at a judicial conference in California, noting that she supported the new code of conduct the court announced months earlier but added it would be more effective if it didn’t leave enforcement up to the individual justices.

President Joe Biden formally called for an enforceable code of conduct in late July, which came in response to a series of ethics scandals involving justices accepting – and not disclosing – private jet travel and posh vacations from GOP donors. Ethics reforms have met with stiff resistance from congressional Republicans, who view the effort instead as a response to a series of conservative outcomes in closely followed cases.

A Marquette Law School poll in August found that 57% of Americans disapprove of the court, compared with 61% who felt that way two years ago. Nearly 6 in 10 respondents in the latest poll said the justices’ decisions are motivated mainly by politics, compared with 43% who believe their decisions are based mainly on the law.

Kagan, nominated by President Barack Obama, brushed off a report in ProPublica this month documenting criticism from the head of a religious legal group who described Kagan’s embrace of an enforceable code of ethics as “somewhat treasonous.” Kagan quipped about the description “somewhat treasonous” – it either is, or it isn’t – before adding that she didn’t “want to dignify it any further.”

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden’s first and only nominee to the high court, has also signaled support for an enforceable code of ethics.

“From my perspective, I don’t have any problem with an enforceable code,” Jackson, the newest member of the high court, told “CBS News Sunday Morning” in a recent interview.

“A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges. And so I guess the question is, ‘Is the Supreme Court any different?’” Jackson said. “And I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different than the other courts.”

Kagan suggested that seemed like a reasonable way to hold the members of the court accountable.

“I think that there are plenty of judges around this country who could do a task like that in a very fair minded and serious way,” she said.

Laments use of emergency docket

Kagan also reiterated concern that she and others on the court have expressed about an explosion of cases on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. Noting that there were more high-profile emergency cases this summer than in past years, Kagan called it a “tough problem.”

The court’s emergency docket – the “shadow docket,” to critics – is where the justices deal with questions that need resolution faster than the months it can take to submit briefs, hear oral arguments and draft formal opinions on its regular docket.

The cases usually deal with the narrow question of what will happen as that underlying legal process plays out. But the orders can have significant and immediate real-world consequences.

“I think we have to … grant these emergency petitions with real restraint, understanding that it’s not where we do our best law,” Kagan said, adding that, on the other hand, there are times when “you just can’t leave something in place of great importance for three years.”"
politics,Alleged leaders of White supremacist group charged in effort to encourage terrorism and hate crimes,2024-09-09,Hannah Rabinowitz,"A federal grand jury in California has handed up charges unsealed on Monday against two men who allegedly led an online group that pushed others to attack politicians or commit hate crimes as part of an effort to bring down the US government.

The men, 37-year-old Matthew Allison and 34-year-old Dallas Humber, are the leaders of an online White supremacist group called the Terrorgram Collective, prosecutors say. The collective subscribes to White supremacist accelerationism, meaning they allegedly believe violence and terrorism are necessary to start a race war, ignite the collapse of the government and prompt the rise of a White ethnostate.

To that end, prosecutors allege that Allison and Humber pushed their followers to attack minority communities, government infrastructure, politicians, government officials and the leaders of private companies – some of whom, including a US senator and a federal judge, were included in a detailed list of “high value targets” for assassination.

Allison and Humber are facing 15 charges, including soliciting the murder of federal officials, distributing bomb-making instructions, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. No lawyers are listed for the defendants in court records.

Their strategy to encourage others to commit violence was effective, Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said in a news conference Monday. One Terrorgram user livestreamed himself stabbing five people outside of a mosque in Turkey, she said, and a 19-year-old Slovakian man praised the group in a manifesto before killing two people at an LGBTQ bar in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.

“Make no mistake – as hate groups turn to these online platforms, the federal government is adapting and responding to protect vulnerable communities,” Clarke said Monday. “You can’t escape accountability by hiding behind a computer screen.”

The group used Telegram, an encrypted messaging platform, to communicate, prosecutors say. From descriptions of the group in court documents, it appears to have followers both within the United States and from other countries.

According to court documents, Allison and Humber drafted a digital publication called “The Hard Reset” that laid out the Terrorgram ideology. The writings allegedly gave detailed instructions on how to run a terror cell as well as instructions on how to carry out bias-motivated hate crimes, attack critical infrastructure, make bombs and identify targets.

They also allegedly produced several videos and instructional manuals on how to carry out the most lethal attacks possible, including one with instructions on how to make and detonate a dirty bomb – or a bomb with radioactive materials – to “fumigate the cities” of minority groups."
politics,"Crypto-related fraud jumped by 45% last year, FBI says",2024-09-09,Sean Lyngaas,"Victims reported more than $5.6 billion in fraud related to cryptocurrency in 2023, a 45% increase from losses reported in 2022, the FBI said Monday in a new report.

A jump in crypto-related investment scams fueled the overall increase in fraud. Victims reported nearly $4 billion in crypto-related investment losses in 2023 compared to $2.57 billion in 2022.

It’s the first time the FBI has published a report explicitly focused on crypto-related fraud from a larger set of annual fraud data, an FBI official told reporters on a call. Crypto-related fraud was close to a half of the record $12.5 billion in losses from online fraud reported to the FBI last year.

The FBI is trying to raise public awareness about the issue and to get victims to more quickly report crypto fraud to recover the stolen money. “Many victims have accumulated massive debt to cover losses from these fraudulent investments,” the FBI official said.

The report underscores “a continuing threat to the American public” from overseas scammers, the official added. “Cryptocurrencies touch on every threat the FBI investigates.”

The FBI investigates a vast array of digital crimes, including ransomware attacks and tech-support scams, which cost the global economy billions of dollars annually. The new report shows that crypto is the currency of choice for many of these schemes.

An increasing number of crooks in different parts of the world are getting involved in the investment scams, which involve gaining the confidence of victims and duping them into investing cryptocurrency in phony ventures, the FBI official said.

People of all ages can fall victim to a crypto-fraud scheme, the official said. People over 60 accounted for $1.6 billion in reported losses in 2023, according to the report.

A CNN investigation last year spotlighted some of the tens of thousands of American victims of the elaborate crypto-investment schemes, which are sometimes carried out by Chinese crime syndicates out of war-torn Myanmar and other countries in Southeast Asia."
politics,"Lawmakers return to Washington, DC, with presidential politics looming large",2024-09-08,Annie Grayer,"Washington CNN —

When the House Judiciary Committee held a field hearing on Friday to highlight the impact border security issues have on local communities, the latest installment of an ongoing series, Vice President Kamala Harris was underlying their line of attack for the first time.

Four months ago, when the panel held a similar field hearing in North Dakota, the vice president was not mentioned by name once.

The shift, both in branding and messaging from the “Biden Border Crisis” to the “Biden-Harris Border Crisis” underscores how House Republicans are pivoting to specifically target Harris after the summer of Democratic reckoning over President Joe Biden resulted in Harris becoming the Democrats’ presidential nominee with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.

As Congress embarks on a three-week sprint before its next recess, both parties return to Washington, DC, for a final messaging push dictated by the dynamics of the presidential race in an entirely new political landscape, while trying to balance the critical September 30 government funding deadline.

Republicans have turned their operation – initially designed to target Biden – on its head to now go after Harris, and Democrats are positioning themselves to frame the GOP attacks as a last-ditch effort while planning some offensive moves of their own.

Members of the Trump campaign advised the House GOP conference during a private call on Friday about what her biggest perceived weaknesses are and to keep their attack of Harris on the border and the state of the economy, a source on the call told CNN. Calls between Republican lawmakers and Trump campaign officials are expected to be a regular occurrence in the coming weeks, sources told CNN, as backchannel coordination ahead of the November election intensifies.

The guidance from the Trump campaign largely mirrors the playbook Republicans had used against Biden, and given Harris is part of Biden’s administration and has been the tie-breaking vote in the Senate in her role as vice president, Republicans plan to keep those issues in the spotlight.

With these sustained attacks on the border and immigration, Democrats will continue to point to border crossings being at a four-year low because of new Biden administration policies and emphasize that Republicans tanked a bipartisan border deal for political reasons.

But while there is evidence that Republicans are trying to develop a more targeted approach to the Harris-Walz ticket – as old tropes such as “Biden crime family” fall by the wayside – some GOP messaging ploys on Harris have come off disjointed. Republicans have been trying to find their footing when it comes to attacking Harris over the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, to further divide Democrats over the issue. While Harris has stood behind Biden in his handling of the war, and largely shares the same positions as the president, Republicans can’t seem to decide in their messaging if Harris is too close to or too much of an opponent of Israel.

A Republican-linked group in Michigan for example purchased digital ads last week touting Harris’ close relationship with Israel, while former President Donald Trump said this week at an event that if Harris were elected Israel will “no longer exist.”

On top of that, some Republicans have deviated from the script and gone after Harris for being a “DEI hire,” unleashing swift blowback that those attacks were racially charged.

GOP committees lead the new Harris-focused effort

The Republican-led congressional committees have been spearheading the shift in focus from Biden to Harris.

Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, for example, will release a report and hold a news conference Monday on the chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it an “unprecedented oversight of the Biden-Harris administration,” in an apparent messaging shift after previously labeling it the responsibility of the Biden administration.

The House Education and Workforce Committee issued a subpoena to Walz on Wednesday for documents related to a $250 million fraud scheme where individuals affiliated with a Minnesota-based nonprofit were charged with stealing from a federal program designed to provide meals for needy children during the pandemic.

The House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz last month alleging the Minnesota governor has ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and a committee source told CNN the panel plans to hold hearings targeting the Biden-Harris administration when lawmakers return to session.

GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida asked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last month to turn over any documents that use the terms “czar,” “border,” “migration,” or “immigration” in relation to Harris, as Republicans continue to try and frame Harris as the “border czar,” while the White House rejects the label, arguing her focus was on long-term fixes. And GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raising questions about Walz’s representation of his military record.

“We don’t have a lot of time,” GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN on Thursday about how Republicans are pivoting to focus on Harris in September.

“I certainly believe that (Harris’) role should be under the microscope,” Mace added.

The GOP turn in focus to Harris however leaves a huge GOP investigative target in an awkward position.

The trio of committees leading the impeachment inquiry into Biden, once a top priority for the GOP investigative agenda, released their report on Biden in the thick of August recess without a clear path forward. Instead of pushing for the House to vote on impeachment, the report leaves it up to lawmakers to decide how to move forward.

Summarizing the GOP approach to Biden now that the president is not running for reelection, Mike Davis, a former top aide to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and founder of the Article III Project, told CNN, “Joe Biden who? No one cares about him anymore.”

And with only a matter of weeks before Election Day, even Republicans have acknowledged they have more pressing political fish to fry.

“I think just looking at the calendar, I think that it’s unlikely that there will be action on impeachment with Joe Biden,” GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia told CNN. “However, I have said for the better part of four years now that Joe Biden should be impeached.”

Democrats see through GOP efforts

But Democrats see the new push to target Harris and Walz as empty threats, and they point to GOP attacks on Harris’ race as disqualifying.

“Republicans can’t win on policy, and that’s why they’re attacking Kamala Harris’ identity and lying about Tim Walz’s military record,” Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California told CNN. “We have plenty to attack them on.”

On top of pushing back on the GOP claims, Democrats are using their spots on committees, even though they are in the minority, to go on offense, and are plotting messaging strategies of their own.

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who serves on the Oversight Committee, criticized Republicans for their snap investigations into Harris and Walz.

“All of a sudden, the only three weeks we are going to be there, we are opening up all these new things?” Moskowitz said.

Framing the Democratic strategy on these committees, Moskowitz added: “We pivot, we go on the offense, we don’t play defense.”

On Monday, Democrats in both chambers showcased how they plan to use their positions on committees to try and put Republicans in tough positions. House Oversight Democrats are pressuring House Oversight Chairman James Comer to hold a hearing on gun violence following the Apalachee High School shooting in Winder, Georgia, while Senate Judiciary Democrats announced a hearing later this month to put the Supreme Court decision limiting the charges against Trump relating to January 6, 2021, in the spotlight.

Earlier this month, House Oversight Committee Democrats launched an investigation into whether Trump received $10 million from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as part of his 2016 presidential campaign, the latest example of Democrats investigating the potential foreign influence over Trump.

The Democratic working group that has spearheaded messaging against Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that has attracted considerable blowback in Trump’s race for the White House, also has a slew of messaging events planned over the next month, multiple sources told CNN.

While Trump continues to deny any involvement with Project 2025, Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee are preparing to continue to highlight examples where they see evidence of the right wing blueprint in Republican funding proposals in Congress.

politics,Retired military leaders defend Harris while placing blame on Trump for Afghanistan withdrawal in letter,2024-09-09,"Ebony Davis, Michael Williams","Several retired military officials issued a letter in support of Vice President Kamala Harris as Republicans attempt to tie her to the chaotic 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

“Vice President Kamala Harris is the best – and only – presidential candidate in this race who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief. She has demonstrated her ability to take on the most difficult national security challenges in the Situation Room and on the international stage,” the group wrote in a National Security Leaders for America letter.

The letter cited Harris “rallying our allies against Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine to standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Indo-Pacific against China’s provocative actions, to advancing U.S. leadership on space and artificial intelligence.”

The letter comes after House Republicans and Democrats issued dueling documents casting blame for mistakes made in the US exit from Afghanistan. The Republican report cites Harris as having worked “in lockstep with President Biden behind the scenes to withdraw all US troops.” It also aims to implicate Harris in its accusations by referring to the current government as “the Biden-Harris administration.”

The group of retired generals placed blame on former President Donald Trump for “putting service members in harm’s way” while he was in office, and argued he didn’t leave the Biden administration in a position to execute a withdrawal efficiently.

“Without involving the Afghan government, he and his Administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield,” the letter claimed.

“Then, he left President Biden and Vice President Harris with no plans to execute a withdrawal, and with little time to do so. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris Administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.”

The exit of American troops from Afghanistan had always been a critical goal for Biden. During his time as vice president, Biden repeatedly pushed then-President Barack Obama to draw down troop numbers – advice which Obama ignored, ordering a troop surge before beginning a drawdown.

Trump also worked toward a withdrawal during his time as president. His administration entered into an agreement with the Taliban for a May 1, 2021, deadline for troops to exit the country; Biden as president said that timeline wasn’t feasible, and pushed it back several months to the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

Biden hoped to avoid any optics during the drawdown that would draw comparisons to the chaotic withdraw of US military troops from Vietnam in 1975, which was immortalized by pictures of Americans hurriedly rushing to a helicopter from the roof of the US embassy during the fall of Saigon. Discussing his plan in July 2021, Biden vowed there would be “no circumstance in which you are going to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.”

The reality, though, was more complicated. The bloody and chaotic withdrawal included a suicide bombing that killed 13 American troops and about 170 Afghans outside Kabul’s airport.

Inside, some Afghans fell to their deaths after clinging to the underside of American military planes in a last-ditch and futile effort to escape Taliban rule – exactly the type of imagery Biden had hoped to avoid, and which presented the first major foreign policy issue for Biden’s presidency. It would later be overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the Hamas attack against Israel last October.

Since then, Democrats and Republicans have traded blame for the chaotic withdrawal. Republicans accused Biden of demanding a withdrawal no matter the costs while Democrats blamed Trump for striking the Taliban deal that set the withdrawal in motion in the first place. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as Trump’s national security adviser, has argued Trump deserves some of the blame for the chaos.

Even three years later, the politics of the withdrawal continue to trail the campaign. During a visit to Arlington National Cemetery last month to commemorate the Kabul airport bombing, staffers for Trump’s campaign reportedly brushed aside a cemetery worker who tried preventing the campaign from taking photos or video in the section of the cemetery containing the remains of troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump’s campaign insisted there were no violations of the law and attacked the worker involved in the confrontation.

Harris responded to the controversy by saying Trump “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.”

politics,Trump says he will vote to legalize adult recreational marijuana use in Florida,2024-09-09,Kate Sullivan,"Former President Donald Trump said Sunday he will vote for a ballot measure in Florida that would legalize adult recreational marijuana use – a position that puts him at odds with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican leaders in the state.

“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product. As a Floridian, I will be voting YES on Amendment 3 this November,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Trump continued, “As President, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.”

The decision is in line with the criminal justice reform he signed into law as president, though Trump has also made being seen as tough on crime central to his political identity. Trump is taking a position largely popular with Americans, even as members of his own party have opposed it.

It’s a rare area of agreement between Trump and his opponent in November. Vice President Kamala Harris has supported efforts by the Biden administration to pardon people convicted of having small amounts of marijuana and the effort to reclassify the drug in federal law to a lower level. Harris has her own political liabilities around crime, having been criticized for prosecuting people for possessing small amounts of drugs during her time as a prosecutor.

Trump previously said in a post that he thought the ballot initiative in Florida would pass “whether people like it or not,” and that he thought adults in Florida shouldn’t be arrested for having “personal amounts” of marijuana. He also called for the Florida legislature to create laws that prohibit recreational marijuana use in public spaces.

Trump’s pledge to “unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug” comes after he praised medical marijuana on the Lex Fridman Podcast last week.

The ballot initiative, which would require 60% of the vote to pass, “Allows adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and marijuana accessories for non-medical personal consumption by smoking, ingestion, or otherwise,” according to the text of the measure. It also “allows Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, and other state licensed entities, to acquire, cultivate, process, manufacture, sell, and distribute such products and accessories.”

DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the GOP presidential primary but then endorsed the former president when he suspended his campaign, has bashed the ballot initiative as “radical” and said earlier this year if it passed, “This state will start to smell like marijuana in our cities and towns.”

The Florida GOP declared its opposition to the ballot initiative in May, and the Republican Party of Florida’s executive board unanimously passed a resolution opposing it. Florida GOP Chairman Evan Power released a statement saying this amendment, as well as a separate abortion amendment, “are unnecessary attempts by an increasingly shrinking minority who know the only way to win support for their radical agenda is to confuse and mislead the electorate.”"
politics,House Republicans and Democrats issue dueling documents casting blame for mistakes made in US withdrawal from Afghanistan,2024-09-08,"Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood","Republicans and Democrats released dueling documents on the deadly August 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan on Monday, with Republicans accusing President Joe Biden of demanding a US exit no matter the cost and claiming his administration prioritized optics over personnel security.

The reports come as former President Donald Trump’s campaign seeks to make the decisions surrounding the exit a key issue in the final weeks before the presidential election.

Republicans in their report highlight public comments from Biden administration officials that did not reflect the reality on the ground, while Democrats claimed in their memorandum that the GOP is manipulating the facts.

The release — after years of investigation by the Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee — of the report by GOP Chairman Rep Michael McCaul and a minority memorandum by Democratic Ranking Member Rep. Gregory Meeks underscore how partisan the debate over the frenzied US exit from Afghanistan has become. The reports also thrust the evacuation back into the spotlight during the lead-up to the election as the GOP has used the evacuation to attack Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Republican report cites Harris as having worked “in lockstep with President Biden behind the scenes to withdraw all US troops.”

The documents are the latest in a series of examinations of the withdrawal, which saw the deaths of 13 US service members and left behind thousands of Afghans who had worked with the United States.

Accusations of culpability have fallen largely along party lines, with Republicans pointing fingers at the Biden administration for hastily pulling the US out of the country and Democrats, including the White House, casting blame on the Trump administration for striking a deal with the Taliban that set the US withdrawal into motion.

The conclusions of both documents, obtained by CNN ahead of their release Monday, continue that pattern. Although there were some new details revealed, the overarching findings largely align with what was already known.

The Republican report is highly critical of the Biden administration and pins the blame for the chaotic exit exclusively on its decisions. It also aims to implicate Harris, now the Democratic nominee for president, in its accusations by referring to the current government as “the Biden-Harris administration.”

“The Biden-Harris administration misled and, in some instances, directly lied to the American people at every stage of the withdrawal, from before the go-to-zero order until today,” the more than 350-page long Republican report alleges.

It lays out 23 recommendations, including the passage of resolutions condemning President Joe Biden, Harris, and other key members of the national security team.

The recommendations also focus on making future non-combatant evacuation operations (NEO) successful, calling for Congress to put into place standard operating procedures for such a drawdown and requirements for the State Department and DOD to brief congress on NEO plans when an embassy has been designated as a high threat post.

The long list also calls for the declassification of information related to the deadly Abbey Gate terrorist attack that killed 13 service members and dozens of Afghans and the establishment of eyewitness portals for after-action reviews.

“Anyone who reads this report will be able to see that we conducted this investigation with integrity, not drawing conclusion ahead of time but rather looking at the facts and evidence we collected. The report is simply a recitation of those facts and evidence,” McCaul said in response to accusations from his Democratic colleagues and the administration that the report was politicized.

“This is not about politics to me — it never has been. It’s about getting to the bottom of what happened so we can make sure it never happens again,” he said in a statement. “And it’s about finding who was responsible for this catastrophe so they can finally, after three long years, be held accountable.”

Meeks, the Democratic ranking member on the committee, accused McCaul of pursuing a “predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal” and asserted that “Republicans’ partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season.”

The White House also denounced McCaul’s report.

“Everything we have seen and heard of Chairman McCaul’s latest partisan report shows that it is based on cherry-picked facts, inaccurate characterizations, and pre-existing biases that have plagued this investigation from the start,” said Sharon Yang, a White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations.

Republicans accuse Biden admin of pursuing withdrawal ‘no matter the cost’

McCaul formally launched his investigation after assuming the chairmanship of the committee in January 2023, vowing to scrutinize the State Department’s planning, decision-making, and execution of the withdrawal.

The Republican probe included multiple hearings, transcribed interviews with 18 former and current officials, and the review of thousands of pages of documents from the US government.

The resulting report comes away with five conclusions.

It claims the Biden administration was “determined to withdraw from Afghanistan, with or without the Doha Agreement” – an agreement brokered under the Trump administration for a phased but eventual full withdrawal from Afghanistan – “and no matter the cost.” It accuses the administration of ignoring “the conditions in the Doha Agreement, pleas of the Afghan government, and the objections by our NATO allies, deciding to unilaterally withdraw from the country.”

It also accuses the administration of prioritizing “the optics of the withdrawal over the security of U.S. personnel on the ground.” It takes aim at the administration’s delay in ordering a NEO – a fact that has been well-scrutinized and documented. The report said that “Afghanistan once again became a haven for terrorists, including al Qaeda and ISIS-K” following the US withdrawal.

Among the other findings of the report, it said that Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad – who was appointed under the Trump administration – was negotiating a succession plan for the Afghan government that included the Taliban, and the committee claims he was “wedded to the idea.”

While the negotiations led by Khalilzad had been widely covered in news reports – and never resulted in an agreement due to the Taliban moving to military take Kabul – the details of what was being pursued remained unclear at times.

Khalilzad, who participated in a transcribed interview with the committee, said that “the power-sharing demand increased from 50-50, to 60-40 in favor of the Taliban, to 70-30 in favor of the Taliban,” the report writes. Khalilzad noted in his interview: “As the balance shifted on the ground … the negotiations on the government continued, but the dollar demand with it increased.”

The report also cites comments that Biden administration officials made to the public around the time of the withdrawal which contradicted the information that the US government had about the situation on the ground.

For example, in October 2021, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed it would have taken 5,000 troops to protect the Bagram Air Force Base, which the US handed over to the Afghans in July of 2021. Yet General McKenzie testified to the committee that “at 2,500 U.S. forces, if you also assume that will allow the Afghans to stay in the fight, you can maintain a viable base at Bagram.” He added that he had believed maintaining Bagram was critical to stability in the country. Psaki also made public comments stating that no one could have assessed that the Afghan military would fall as quickly as it did, despite existing US government assessments at the time predicting that a fall could happen swiftly.

The Democratic memorandum outlines its separate takeaways from the hearings, documents, and transcribed interviews. It argues that the Trump administration set the withdrawal in motion and “failed to plan for executing it.” It also claims that the Biden administration initiated a “robust” process to review the evacuation. The memorandum argues that the fall of Kabul to the Taliban “precipitously changed the situation in Kabul and prompted a dynamic and unprecedented U.S. government response that protected Americans, our allies, and our interests.”

Moreover, Meeks’ memorandum argues that the findings are not new —”it comports with what Administration officials, the State Department’s own After-Action Review on Afghanistan (AAR), and extensive press reporting have already said repeatedly over years about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.”

“This narrative is also not without points of debate – such as over whether to retain a small force in Afghanistan, whether U.S. analysts should have better anticipated the fall of the Afghan government and rapid speed of the Taliban’s takeover, or the precise timing of shifting from civilian-led evacuation flights to a NEO – but no thorough policy process would be, nor do any Commander-in-Chief’s decisions satisfy everyone,” it says.

Democrats’ memorandum on the report

Meeks said he released his own memorandum because “American taxpayers have funded this Committee’s oversight, and the American people deserve the truth.”

The New York Democrat also accused his Republican colleagues of further politicizing the matter ahead of the election.

“With the ascendance of Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket, the GOP performance has reached a crescendo — Republicans now claim she was the architect of the U.S. withdrawal though she is referenced only three times in 3,288 pages of the Committee’s interview transcripts,” Meeks charged.

Even with the release of the report, McCaul has made clear that he continues to pursue his probe as Election Day nears and even after.

“We have a lot of unanswered questions regarding the” Department of Defense, McCaul told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday, ahead of the report’s publication. He said “didn’t reach any conclusions” regarding the Abbey Gate attack at the Kabul airport. That deadly attack, which was claimed by ISIS-K has been the subject of multiple investigations.

The Republican Chairman has subpoenaed Secretary of State Antony Blinken to testify on the report. Some of the recommendations of the report call for the testimony of officials like national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

“Congress has a responsibility to ensure those at fault during the Afghanistan withdraw are finally held accountable,” the report says.

On the eve of the report’s release McCaul said that the conduct of the withdrawal amounted to “moral negligence of the administration.”

“This was one of the deadliest days in Afghanistan. It could have been prevented if the State Department did its job by law and executed the plan of evacuation. They did not do that until, until the day that the Taliban invaded and overran Kabul. By that time, it was too late,” McCaul said on CBS.

McCaul also claimed that the release of the report at this time was not an effort to play politics, pointing to the many roadblocks that the committee faced as they tried to gather information and conduct interviews.

But State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement to CNN that “it remains deeply disappointing that House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans used this process to politicize Afghanistan policy instead of working on legislative solutions to strengthen our country.”

“They have done a disservice by relying on false information and presenting inaccurate narratives meant only to harm the Administration, instead of seeking to actually inform Americans on how our longest war came to an end,” Miller said. “The State Department remains immensely proud of its workforce who put themselves forward in the waning days of our presence in Afghanistan to evacuate both Americans and the brave Afghans who stood by over sides for more than two decades.”

Yang, the White House spokesperson, also defended the administration’s decisions and cast blame on Trump and the Doha agreement brokered under his presidency, saying Biden “inherited an untenable position.”

“As we have said many times, ending our longest war was the right thing to do and our nation is stronger today as a result,” Yang said in a statement to CNN. “Bringing our troops home after 20 years put us in a stronger position by allowing us to redirect our resources to confront threats to international peace and stability, such as Russia’s war in Ukraine, an ongoing crisis in the Middle East, China’s increasingly aggressive actions, and terror threats that exist around the world.”

In June 2023, the State Department released its long-awaited Afghanistan After Action Review report, which found that both the Trump and Biden administrations’ decisions to pull all US troops from Afghanistan had detrimental consequences, and detailed damning shortcomings by the current administration that led to the deadly and chaotic US withdrawal from that country after nearly two decades on the ground.

The report made recommendations for the future, mostly related to the Department’s crisis response and preparedness. Both the State Department report and the Republicans’ report recommended putting a single point person in charge at the department when there is a complex crisis unfolding.

politics,New rules from GOP-majority election board could cause disarray in battleground Georgia,2024-09-09,"Sara Murray, Jason Morris","Atlanta CNN —

The once-wonky Georgia State Election Board has burst into the limelight this year as a new Republican majority – made up of a retired obstetrician, a former state senator who put out feelers for a Trump administration job and a right-wing media personality – push ahead with new rules that could create chaos in November.

The reshaping of the election board in one of the most critical battleground states of 2024 highlights how some Republicans who cast doubt on the 2020 presidential election results have now taken on prominent roles driving election rules and, in some areas, overseeing elections.

With less than two months before Election Day, three Republicans on the five-member board are pushing through new rules that could jeopardize election certification, particularly if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the state, election experts and voting rights groups said.

“We can’t be doing this at the last minute because it creates chaos. And chaos undermines confidence in our elections, full stop,” said Sarah Tindall Ghazal, the lone Democrat on the board. She has kept a low profile since she was appointed in 2021 but has recently emerged in the press to try to counter the election board’s sharp right turn.

The board is set to consider another slate of new rules at its September 20 meeting.

“They’re not taking the advice of attorneys, they’re not taking the advice of election administrators – who are really critical in this whole calculus – and they’re certainly not listening to anybody who doesn’t think that the elections are rigged,” she said of the three Republicans driving the raft of rule changes.

The five-person election board was once led by Georgia’s secretary of state. But after 2020, former President Donald Trump fought to overturn his loss in the Peach State, pressuring Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the thousands of votes Trump needed to win. Raffensperger refused, and in the aftermath, the GOP-led state legislature removed the secretary as a member of the board.

“The state election board is a mess,” Raffensperger told reporters recently.

Defending the changes

Republican Janelle King, a media personality and the newest member of the board, has also become its most vocal defender. She was appointed in May by Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns and has since shrugged aside criticism and ethics complaints that the board’s recent moves have generated.

“I don’t care because I know we haven’t done anything wrong,” King told CNN in an interview. “This is a method of trying to weaken the Republican side by making it seem like we’re out here trying to steal elections. There’s no win for me to steal the election for anybody.”

King insisted she does not believe the 2020 election was stolen. But she has backed several of the board’s new rules, including a controversial change allowing partisans who serve on local election boards to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying election results.

The state election board in Georgia does not certify the results of any election. But it makes rules that guide election administrators and the local boards that certify results before they are sent up to the secretary of state and then the governor. The state election board also investigates election irregularities.

King and other Republicans have argued recent rule changes are necessary to ensure vote counts are accurate and local election board members have the information they need to feel confident certifying the vote.

“The concerns around these rules creating chaos, I do not see that happening at all,” King said.

Rick Jeffares, a former Republican state senator, also joined the board this year. He was appointed by Georgia’s Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, one of the 2020 pro-Trump fake electors.

When he joined the board, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Jeffares had spread claims on social media, which have since been removed or made private, around the 2020 election about Democrats cheating and dead people voting.

Jeffares has continued to court controversy by floating his name for a possible role in a future Trump administration.

“I said if y’all can’t figure out who you want to be the EPA director for the south-east, I’d like to have it,” Jeffares told The Guardian.

He later told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution it wasn’t a formal ask and, “I didn’t talk to anyone in the Trump administration.”

Jeffares didn’t respond to an interview request from CNN.

Janice Johnston, a retired obstetrician who has spread falsehoods about the 2020 election, joined the board in 2022. At a recent MAGA-branded event – Trump campaign signs behind her – Johnston remarked on her senior status on the newly reshaped board.

“It’s a relatively young board,” Johnston told the crowd. “Now I’m second in seniority, which is shocking because it’s just been a couple of years.”

Johnston also attended a Trump rally in Atlanta last month where the former president applauded the three Republicans, calling them “pit bulls fighting for honestly, transparency and victory.”

Johnston did not respond to CNN’s request for an interview.

Rapid rule changes spook election officials

The board is now led by a longtime Waffle House executive, John Fervier, an independent who was appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp but has voted against the most controversial rules pushed by the board’s Republican majority. He’s warned the three Republicans that some of their moves could be legally precarious and pushed them, unsuccessfully, to abandon an effort to try to reopen investigations into the 2020 election.

The seemingly partisan – and sheer amount – of activity from the board so close to November has raised alarms across the state.

“On election night, the most important thing we’re doing is getting results out. This is going to delay that,” Deirdre Holden, the supervisor for elections and voter registration in Paulding County, said of the board’s new rules at a recent training for election officials. “And it’s not going to be the state election board they are yelling at, its’s going to be our local offices and we already take enough scrutiny.”

A statewide association of election workers wrote an open letter to the board imploring it to stop passing rule changes so close to the election.

A Democrat state senator also filed an ethics complaint against King, Jeffares and Johnston, as did Cathy Woolard, a Democrat and the former chair of the Fulton County Board of Elections.

“We are having a partisan split on every single issue. Election boards should be very predictable, plodding, not partisan,” Woolard said in an interview. “We should be boring.”

Asked whether the board had pushed ahead with enough changes to potentially swing an election, Woolard said, “Oh sure. I think they’ve done enough to cause chaos in election training in 159 counties. They have created openings for people to say they have a reason not to certify an election.”

Over the weekend, a top official in the secretary of state’s office looked to reassure wary members of the public. “We are confident certification will be completed by November 12,” Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling posted on X."
politics,Trump threatens prosecution of 2024 election officials who ‘cheated’ if he wins presidency,2024-09-08,"Kate Sullivan, Jack Forrest","Former President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he again wins the presidency in November.

Trump, again falsely claiming Democrats engaged in fraudulent behavior in 2020, said that he, attorneys and legal scholars are “watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely.”

“WHEN I WIN,” Trump wrote in a post on his social network, Truth Social, that he later also shared on X, “those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.”

Trump’s threats of prosecution — part of his repeated efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election — come as early voting will soon be underway in a number of states. Trump has routinely suggested he would weaponize the justice system to go after his political opponents if voters return him to the White House — threats that began after he was first indicted in his Manhattan hush money case more than a year ago.

Trump, who regularly spreads conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and falsely claims there was widespread voter fraud, added on Saturday, “I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation!”

Despite Trump’s repeated claims, the 2020 election was highly secure, and he lost to Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes. There is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome of the election in any state.

In a post on Sunday, Trump also called on the FBI to investigate mail-in ballots in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania — which are set to go out to voters soon — and cited an interview with an “election expert” conducted by former Fox News host and far-right commentator Tucker Carlson that claimed a fifth of the state’s mail-in ballots were fraudulent.

The former president has for years falsely claimed that mail-in voting leads to fraud and pointed to supposed examples in swing states, including Pennsylvania, in 2020. Despite these claims, Trump’s campaign over the summer launched a new program aimed at promoting absentee, mail-in and early in-person voting ahead of the November election.

Election officials have been the victims of pervasive threats as the 2024 election draws closer, CNN has reported, and elections operations have beefed up security in the face of harassment of elections workers and disinformation about the voting process.

Trump said Saturday he was eyeing everyone from lawyers and donors to voters. “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again,” he wrote. “Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country,” he added.

Trump still faces his own charges over election interference stemming from efforts to subvert the 2020 election, including a four-count indictment in his federal case. A separate election interference case against him in Fulton County, Georgia has been indefinitely paused.

politics,Harris prepares for the showdown she’s long sought with Trump as he takes more informal approach,2024-09-08,"Eric Bradner, Jeff Zeleny, Alayna Treene, Arit John","The most important moment in the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump comes this week, as the vice president prepares for what could be her only opportunity to directly confront a former president whose political dominance she is pledging to end.

Their Tuesday night debate is particularly important for Harris, who is battling to define herself in voters’ eyes and keep up the positive momentum she’s enjoyed since becoming the Democratic Party’s new nominee this summer.

The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be the first face-to-face encounter between Harris and Trump, who are locked in a tight race.

For Harris, it’s a marquee moment to show Americans that she is ready to assume the presidency, a question very much on the minds of voters as the fall campaign intensifies.

“Look, it’s time to turn the page on the divisiveness,” she said during a weekend stop in Pittsburgh, taking a break from her debate preparations. “It’s time to bring our country together, chart a new way forward.”

Trump, meanwhile, is eager to negatively shape voters’ perceptions of his Democratic rival and halt the gains she has made since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in July. Harris has eliminated what for much of the year had been Trump’s lead over Biden in presidential polling.

Both Harris and Trump are offering themselves as change agents of sorts. Harris has pitched herself as a clean break from a bitterly divisive era of politics dominated by Trump. The former president, though, points to Harris’ time in the Biden administration and says she bears the blame for inflation, higher mortgage rates and more.

Trump’s campaign and his allies have accused Harris of avoiding policy particulars. But Trump’s incoherent answer last week to a question about how he would make child care more affordable was a vivid reminder that the former president has long brushed aside policy details and questions about the practicality of his proposals.

Trump has also lobbed racist and lewd attacks against Harris, including falsely claiming in July that she “happened to turn Black” a few years ago (she’s the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants) and sharing on social media references to her former relationship with onetime San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

Whether Trump makes similar comments — and how Harris responds — could shape voters’ perceptions of their clash Tuesday.

The debate, moderated by ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir, is scheduled to last 90 minutes. Like the CNN debate between Trump and Biden in June, candidates’ microphones will be turned on when it’s their turn to speak and muted otherwise.

Those rules — agreed to by the Biden and Trump campaigns — have frustrated Harris, who hoped to tap into her skills as a former prosecutor during any onstage engagements with Trump.

“Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the Harris campaign said Wednesday in a letter to ABC News agreeing to the debate.

Tight race in key swing states

The debate comes just before early voting begins in several key states. Polls have shown a tight race nationally and in key battlegrounds — including the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.

Both campaigns have paid particular attention to Pennsylvania and Georgia, where recent CNN polling found no clear leader between the candidates. Should Trump hold North Carolina, a state he’s won twice, victories in Pennsylvania and Georgia could push him past the 270 electoral vote threshold even if he does not win any of the other battleground states.

Harris got a jolt of good news late last week, when her campaign announced it had pulled in almost triple her Republican rival’s fundraising haul in August — $361 million to Trump’s $130 million — entering September with $404 million in cash reserves for the final two-month sprint to November. That sum far surpasses the $295 million Trump’s political operation says it has in the bank.

A Sunday New York Times/Siena College poll, however, underscored the importance of the fight over defining Harris. The survey, which showed the two candidates about evenly matched nationally, suggested that a sizable share of voters still need more information about the vice president: 28% of likely voters said they feel like they need to learn more about Harris, while just 9% said the same about Trump.

The poll also offered some potential warnings for Harris. While 61% of likely voters said they thought the next president should represent a “major change” from Biden, just 25% said they thought Harris represented such a change, while 53% said Trump did.

The same poll found that 47% of likely voters found Harris too liberal, despite her attempts to moderate in recent weeks, compared with 32% who said Trump is too conservative.

Pittsburgh debate camp

The two candidates have taken drastically different approaches to preparing for their Tuesday showdown.

No presidential nominee in the modern age has done more televised general election debates than Trump. Harris and her team have been carefully studying all six of them — three with Hillary Clinton in 2016, two with Biden in 2020, and another with Biden in June — as she prepares for her turn onstage.

Harris has spent the days leading up to the debate hunkered down with aides at a hotel in Pittsburgh, making only occasional, brief public appearances. But aides said she has been thinking about a debate with Trump since the moment Biden ended his bid for reelection in late July.

“I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage,” Harris told reporters last month. “I’m ready. Let’s go.”

She’s been reading briefing papers about Trump’s comments, positions and even the insults he’s directed at her, aides said, as well as familiarizing herself with how Trump comported himself with his two previous Democratic opponents, particularly Clinton.

Harris has spoken extensively to both Clinton and Biden about debating Trump, hoping to benefit from their experiences.

And she began telegraphing her approach to Trump even before her nomination became official, telling a crowd in Atlanta in late July: “If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.”

A strategy for Harris, aides said, is not only to stand up to the former president, but to make the case that it’s time for the country to move beyond the Trump era. Any of his taunts on race are expected to be diminished and dismissed as the “same old, tired playbook,” as Harris said during her sit-down interview with CNN last month.

While many candidates have outwardly bristled at debate preparations, aides said Harris is digging into the practice sessions with mock debates against a Trump stand-in, longtime Clinton aide Philippe Reines, and preparing like she did during her years as a prosecutor.

Karen Dunn, a Washington lawyer who has helped Democratic candidates prepare for debates for more than a decade, is running the practice sessions for Harris. Dunn, who worked with Clinton ahead of her encounters with Trump in 2016, got to know Harris when she prepared her to face Vice President Mike Pence in 2020.

“Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking,” Harris said at one point during that debate, delivering a line that could be reprised on Tuesday if she is faced with any interruptions. “If you don’t mind letting me finish, we can have a conversation. OK? OK.”

Trump’s informal approach

In recent days Trump has ribbed Harris over her preparations and claimed that his debate performance won’t get a fair review.

“If I destroy her in the debate, they’ll say, ‘Trump suffered a humiliating defeat tonight,’” the former president said at a Saturday campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin.

Trump, who argued he doesn’t need formal preparation such as mock debates, has been meeting with senior advisers, policy experts and outside allies to ready himself for Tuesday.

The “policy discussions” — the Trump campaign’s version of debate prep — largely mirror those the former president held in the weeks leading up to his June 27 debate with Biden, sources familiar with the meetings told CNN.

Trump senior adviser Jason Miller has been handling the meetings, which have included sessions with former Trump administration official Stephen Miller, Trump campaign policy adviser Vincent Haley, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, among others.

The sessions have largely focused on helping Trump sharpen his messaging on a range of issues, from the economy to immigration and American democracy at large.

The Trump campaign also deliberately scheduled a slate of events in the days leading up to the debate, such last week’s policy speech to the Economic Club of New York and his town hall with Fox News, in an effort to have him hone his messaging in public, his advisers said.

People close to Trump argue one of the most crucial aspects of his Tuesday matchup with Harris is ensuring the former president does not appear overly aggressive toward her and strikes the right tone. As with his June 27 debate with Biden, Trump’s advisers and allies have been encouraging him to appear more restrained while onstage.

However, many privately acknowledge that will be even more important this time. Not only is Harris a more popular candidate than Biden was then, but she is also a woman, and the optics of particular attacks will resonate differently, they say.

Gabbard, who recently endorsed Trump, has been a key player in that effort. The Hawaii Independent was among the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders who challenged Harris on the debate stage. She has been working with Trump to help him better understand Harris’ debate style.

Trump’s advisers believe Gabbard’s attacks on the then-California senator — particularly the scrutiny of her record as a prosecutor — helped undermine Harris’ candidacy in 2019.

The former president’s team has told him to specifically needle Harris on the issues where she has changed her position.

“We want to keep him steered toward hitting her record. On fracking, on her flip flops, and show that she is just as responsible for the Biden administration’s failed policies as Biden is,” one adviser said.

Those helping Trump prepare have also directed him to focus his answers on the core policy issues where he polls higher than Harris, such as the economy, immigration and crime, sources familiar with the meetings said.

“The most important part is finding pivots, finding ways to be critical of her, deflecting attacks from her,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “It’s not about her interrupting him or how she’ll act. It’s about him being on target on his responses on policy. That’s been the main focus.”"
politics,Inside Kamala Harris’ yearslong crash course in foreign diplomacy,2024-09-08,"Kevin Liptak, Mj Lee, Priscilla Alvarez, Kylie Atwood","Washington CNN —

Vice President Kamala Harris has met more than 150 world leaders since becoming vice president. But a July sit-down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt different.

Coming days after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race and as Democrats were coalescing around her candidacy, perhaps no other sit-down would garner as much attention or carry as much weight.

“We have a lot to talk about,” she said, before dismissing reporters — the exact same words Biden used to begin his own meeting. But Harris’ were delivered in a manner that said something entirely different.

The moment, which amounted to Harris’s debut on the world stage as the Democratic standard-bearer, captured the complicated dynamics that have colored her foreign policy ambitions, and offered a preview of the type of statesmanship she would pursue as president.

By virtue of her position as vice president to a commander in chief whose “first love” was foreign policy, according to his aides, Harris had little room over the past three-and-a-half years to stake out her own distinct doctrine or worldview.

Instead, she has hewn closely to the views of her boss, even as she’s become more involved over time in the US response to various roiling global conflicts. In meetings and on trips abroad, she’s acted as a clean-up artist and bearer of bad news on behalf of Biden, traditional roles for a vice president.

Republicans, led by Donald Trump, have argued Harris sat alongside Biden as the world went up in flames. They point to her assertion, made during an interview on CNN, that she was the last person in the room as Biden was deciding to go ahead with his planned US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which ended in chaos and deadly violence.

Harris said in the interview that she was comfortable with Biden’s decision and praised the president’s “courage” in making it. On the campaign trail, she’s argued that Trump’s “chaotic actions” as president led to “catastrophic consequences” in Afghanistan.

Harris herself has shown little daylight between herself and her boss. Asked directly during an August CNN interview – twice – whether she would be doing anything differently than the current president on the Middle East, Harris offered few specifics beyond pointing to a long-negotiated hostage and ceasefire deal.

“No,” she told Dana Bash. “I – we have to get a deal done. Dana, we have to get a deal done.”

Yet for all the close ties between Biden and Harris on the world stage, there are some signs she would not act entirely as a carbon copy of her former boss’s approach. As vice president, she has been a booster for important allies that Biden did not have time to lavish his full attention upon. And she has been a louder voice for causes that haven’t always received the full spotlight of the presidency — in particular the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel

Harris’ unusual step of delivering remarks following her July meeting with Netanyahu was a move she would not likely have made were Biden still running for a second term. White House officials made a concerted decision to allow her short statement to stand as the only substantive comment following Netanyahu’s visit.

While reiterating her steadfast support for Israel – as she had done every time the issue arose over the previous 10 months – she also struck an urgent tone on the plight of the Palestinians.

“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering,” Harris said outside her ceremonial office, next door to the White House, “and I will not be silent.”

Senior White House officials – even as they insisted that there was no daylight between the president and vice president when it comes to Middle East policy – have more readily acknowledged over the last year that their respective tones when discussing the Israel-Hamas war were, in fact, distinct.

“They have different styles, is the reality, when it comes to expressing themselves,” one senior Biden adviser said earlier this year on how the president and Harris tended to publicly discuss the ongoing conflict.

As a result, the vice president’s public statements criticizing Israel’s handling of the Gaza conflict and lamenting the plight of Palestinian civilians had, more than once since the onset of the war, raised questions about whether Harris was on a different page from Biden.

Harris herself has been sensitive to that scrutiny. As one senior Democrat close to the vice president put it, Harris “understands that there’s a perception that she is left of (Biden) on Israel.”

Privately, this Democrat said, the vice president has insisted that she believes it is possible to be both “strongly pro-Israel” and capable of articulating the belief that “this fight is not with the Palestinian people.”

Last December, the vice president also traveled to the Middle East to attend a climate summit – and juggled multiple high stakes meetings and calls with Arab leaders amid heightening tensions, marking her foray into wartime diplomacy and forcefully sending a message of restraint.

As the Israel-Hamas war has unfolded, Harris has displayed a genuine desire to take the pulse of the Arab American community in the US, sources familiar with her engagements said.

Harris has made phone calls to Arab American leaders in the US to understand their perspective and to listen to their criticism of the Biden administration’s policy approach to the conflict, explained two sources. Some have been shocked to receive a call from the vice president, they said.

A Harris aide said that as vice president, she has “strongly condemned Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack on October 7, denounced atrocious acts of sexual violence, advocated relentlessly to bring the hostages home, and worked to ensure Israel remains a secure, democratic and Jewish state.”

Learning on the job

Harris did not enter the job with vast experience on the world stage. Both her advisers and foreign officials she’s interacted with say Harris managed to take what was essentially a supporting role and turn it into a crash course in foreign diplomacy. One former senior adviser described the vice president taking home massive briefing books and often peppering staffers with questions as she was briefed on multiple foreign policy issues.

She began, some said, rather scripted and uncertain but emerged within her first year in office a more confident voice. In meetings, she can appear alternatively warm – searching for commonalities over food or family – and steely, as she holds a firm line on US policy.

Harris advisers argue nothing could have better prepared her to step onto the global stage, should she to win the election in November, than her time as vice president.

They point to her travels abroad, meetings with world leaders and the time that she has spent with Biden navigating a number of major foreign policy crises – including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza – as giving her a certain gravitas that she did not have when she was first seeking the presidency in 2020.

Harris has visited 21 countries in her current role, according to an aide, and met with more than 150 world leaders — including China’s President Xi Jinping, with whom Biden has long sought to cultivate more stable ties.

“There’s no better preparation to be president of the United States than what the vice president has done over the past three-and-a-half years,” a senior administration official said.

Still, Harris has not always been the first phone call for foreign leaders or officials looking to get a line into the White House. Others on Biden’s team, including his secretary of state and national security adviser, have been seen as more central to American decision making, according to diplomats.

As she heads toward November’s election on a swell of Democratic momentum, some foreign governments are looking to know her better.

In the run-up to this month’s United Nations General Assembly, the yearly marathon of diplomacy that brings a parade of foreign leaders to New York, dozens of countries have been reaching out in hopes of setting up a meeting with Harris, multiple US officials said. Some countries have even offered to accommodate or change their schedules to lock in a meeting with her.

Harris currently does not plan to travel up to New York for the assembly, a source familiar with the plans said. As she has done in previous years, it’s possible she will take time to meet with foreign leaders who are visiting the US for the UN gathering in Washington, DC.

US diplomats said it would be to her benefit to sit down with world leaders, but they also understand her team is deciding whether she can afford to be off the campaign trail.

“Every second she is not in Michigan or Pennsylvania is a loss. It is a cost-benefit analysis,” said one US official.

Among those who have worked most closely with Harris on foreign policy matters over the past three-and-a-half years and seen as the vice president’s foreign policy brain trust are Phil Gordon, her national security adviser; Rebecca Lissner, her principal deputy national security adviser; and Dean Lieberman, her deputy national security adviser for strategic communications.

One stalwart of the Biden national security brain trust – with whom Harris held periodic lunch meetings to discuss foreign affairs – suggested this week he would not stay on for a potential Harris presidency.

“All I’m looking at right now is the balance of this administration, in January,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the conclusion of a news conference in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. “And I can tell you, from having spent some time over the last week on bit of a break with my kids, I will relish having a lot more time with them.”

When asked where the vice president’s foreign policy views may ultimately differ from Biden’s, her advisers insist that so long as she is in her current job, they would decline to address what they see as “hypothetical policy questions.”

“She remains the vice president of the United States and stands by the Biden-Harris administration policies,” Lieberman said. That is certainly the case, he added, when it comes to the vice president’s views on the Israel-Hamas war.

Ukraine

A month after Russia invaded Ukraine, Harris was dispatched to NATO’s eastern flank on a reassurance mission – one that also came with some sensitive diplomatic smoothing-over. Moments before she took off for Poland, a rift had emerged between Warsaw and Washington over the transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine.

Aboard Air Force Two, Harris took a phone call from Biden, making sure she was up to speed on the matter. In meetings with leaders, both in Poland and a later stop in Romania, Harris sought both to assert American support for Ukraine and its NATO allies while avoiding any public spat.

For a foreign policy novice with aspirations for higher office, the war in Ukraine was a rigorous introduction to wartime diplomacy.

Days before the 2022 invasion by Russia, Harris met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference and discussed with him the latest American intelligence about what might be coming. She has met with Zelensky six times in total since the war began.

“The Zelensky meeting was a pivotal moment in her journey of leading on foreign policy,” said Nancy McEldowney, who served as national security advisor to Harris from 2021 to early 2022.

“In that meeting, we conducted an unprecedented exchange of detailed intelligence,” McEldowney recalled of the hourslong meeting. “We laid out all of the information, and then talked about what it meant and talked about how the Ukrainians could respond.”

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference the following year in 2023, Harris said Russia had committed crimes against humanity.

Still, while Harris attended the Munich forum as the top Biden administration official twice and met with Zelensky each time, the Ukrainians were frustrated both times when they learned that she was being sent instead of Biden, sources said. In their view, there was no evidence that Harris was – at either time – deeply involved in US policymaking when it came to the war.

During Harris’s meeting with the Ukrainians at Munich in 2024, one private message she delivered was that the US urged the Ukrainians to stop hitting Russian energy inside of Russia, sources said. This was not the first time the Ukrainians had heard the message from US officials, but Harris delivered the message empathically and they were not thrilled, sources said.

Today, Ukrainian officials don’t know exactly what to expect from a Harris presidency if she wins the election.

“They don’t see her as solid as Biden when it comes to supporting Ukraine. Their best bet is that she will uphold that status quo of US support,” said one source close to the Ukrainians.

“Vice President Harris has been a strong proponent of enduring US support for Ukraine and has repeatedly expressed an unwavering commitment to support the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal aggression. She has vowed to continue to support Ukraine and impose costs on Russia,” an aide to the vice president said.

Personal touch

As the US sought to repair the relationship with France after the rollout of a submarine deal that didn’t include the old European ally, the Biden administration sent a number of high-ranking officials to Paris: Blinken, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and then climate envoy John Kerry. The Biden administration then decided to send Harris as the final visitor, which a European official described as a very successful crescendo.

Harris spent four days in the country and developed a “good personal relationship” with French President Emmanuel Macron, the official said.

“At the time she was perceived to not have much experience, but she gave off a really good impression,” the official said. “She displayed what is rare in high-level politicians: She took her time.”

Indeed, unlike Biden – who rarely departed from his schedule of meetings to take in any culture during his trips abroad – Harris made time for a quintessentially Parisian pursuit: Shopping.

Stopping at the E. Dehillerin, the famous cookware shop on Rue Coquilliere near the Louvre, Harris declared she needed some pots for her Thanksgiving meal.

Pointing to the racks of copper ware, she inquired – in French – whether they had a smaller model: “Comme ça, mais plus petit?”"
politics,Bill to address judge shortage faces uphill climb in US House,2024-09-08,Tierney Sneed,"Washington CNN —

Across the country, federal courts are buckling under an ever-increasing caseload in the absence of long-awaited congressional action that would add judges to match a significant growth in litigation over the last several decades.

It’s been 34 years since lawmakers last passed a comprehensive bill increasing the number of judges on lower courts. In that period, the American population has grown by 80 million. The number of filings in US district courts increased by more than 30%. In the past year, there were more than 724,000 pending cases being handled by a federal trial bench made up of 677 judgeships (including roughly 40-50 vacancies) – a 72% increase in pending cases over the last decade, during which, no new district seats have been created.

“We really are pressed to get all of the work done that litigants demand of us, and it affects the quality of the justice that they receive,” Judge Mary Scriven, a federal judge in Tampa, Florida, told CNN.

The staffing shortfall, she and other judges told CNN, is costing litigants time and money, while undermining public confidence in the judiciary. Whether it is addressed any time soon will depend on whether the House can pass in the coming weeks legislation that would create 66 new judgeships – 63 of them permanent – to the country’s most overburdened court districts. The legislation – known as the known as the JUDGES Act or “Judicial Understaffing Delays Getting Emergencies Solved” Act – was quietly approved by the Senate without any opposition just before the August recess.

The bill, which has a House counterpart with bipartisan sponsorship, could face long odds in that chamber where lawmakers will have limited floor time in September, a priority to vote on messaging bills that drive home their political arguments in the weeks before the election and a government shutdown looming they’ll need to avert. The legislation isn’t seen as a top priority for many, and leadership would need to step in as Speaker Mike Johnson is managing an unruly and narrow majority.

Supporters of the JUDGES Act say that the odds of it passing shrink considerably after the election, when it will become clear which party will get to appoint the first round of new judges allotted by the bill.

“That uncertainty – nobody knows for sure what’s going to happen in this election, or any other – that should help to motivate people to get this passed on the House side, and, then, get it done this month,” said Jonathan Hafen, national president of the Federal Bar Association, which has been advocating in favor of the bill.

If it is not passed, the situation for the most stretched federal courts will only grow more dire. The semi-retired judges known as senior judges that have helped carry the extra load will age out of being able to contribute. And a burnout factor is affecting the amount of work that newly retired senior judges are willing to take on, leaving active-status judges scrambling to fill the gaps.

“It just makes the workload relentless,” said Judge Timothy Corrigan, the chief judge of the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, which covers Tampa and the rest of central Florida, and would receive five new judgeships under the bill. “You’re issuing opinions, you’re having trials, you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing, but as soon as you finish one thing, there’s five others that need your attention. It never stops.”

Litigants will have to wait even longer for their cases to be resolved. For defendants being held in jail before trial, that means more months of detention before a jury ever considers the charges against them. And in civil lawsuits, the parties may feel pressure to settle cases that otherwise would have gone to trial because of the cost of paying for seemingly never-ending litigation.

“If the bench doesn’t have capacity, the bench can’t hear those litigants’ cases in a timely way,” said Judge Kimberly Mueller, chief judge of the Eastern District of California’s federal trial court.

‘Not the quality of federal justice’

Mueller’s district — stretching across 34 counties in California’s Central Valley – has just six-active district judges to handle an area that has grown in population from nearly 2.5 million in 1990, when Congress last passed a comprehensive judicial expansion bill, to almost 8.5 million.

Courts prioritize the resolution of criminal cases, as required under the Speedy Trial Act. But still, the median time between the filing of a criminal felony case and its resolution is 33 months in California’s Eastern District.

“Someone can spend many months, if not years, in a local jail in pre-trial detention if they’re detained, waiting to know the outcome of their case,” Mueller said. For prosecutors, the delay risks losing witnesses and their memories.

Under the JUDGES Act, her district would get four additional judgeships, added one by one in 2025, 2027, 2029 and 2031. The bill was crafted based on the recommendations of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body of the federal judiciary, which looked both at case load statistics and other circumstances, like the geography of a court district, the availability of magistrate judges that can help with the work, and factors that could make litigation more complex, like a frequent need for language interpreters.

“We take very great care to make sure that every single judgeship recommendation that we make is reasonable, and it’s defensible and it’s based on the actual workload needs,” said US Circuit Judge Nancy Moritz, who chairs the Judicial Statistics subcommittee of Judicial Conference’s Committee on Judicial Resources.

In some court districts, divisions with increasingly busy dockets don’t have dedicated judges, meaning there is a scramble to assign out the case load to judges elsewhere in the district. For instance, there is no sitting judge in the Florida Middle District’s Ocala division – home to The Villages, a retirement community that has grown dramatically in recent years.

“That community deserves a full-time district judge sitting in the Ocala courthouse handling those cases, allowing the community to come in and watch and so forth,” Corrigan said. “The fact that we’re unable to provide that right now is just not the quality of federal justice that you would hope that we would be able to provide.”

A push for quick passage in the House

The bill’s top Senate supporters – Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who first introduced the legislation in 2020, and Delaware Sen. Chris Coon, its initial Democratic cosponsor – are pushing for quick passage in the House this September, given how November’s election could disincentivize the losing party from supporting it.

However, even a co-sponsor of the House version, Rep. Hank Johnson, expressed skepticism of that timeline. Pointing to the government spending legislation the House will be working on next month, the Georgia Democrat told CNN that “I think it’s most likely that it’ll take place during the lame duck session.”

The bill’s supporters are reaching out both to House leadership and the House members whose congressional districts would see judgeships added to their courthouses, a Senate aide involved in the push told CNN.

To get the broad support that allowed the legislation to pass both the Senate Judiciary Committee – the site of some of the most pitched, party-line battles in that chamber – and the Senate floor without any opposition, the bill’s architects had to stretch out the time period over which judges would be added to the various district courts. The bill allocates new judges over 12 years.

“Chances are good that both parties will have a turn in the White House at some point over that span of time, and all judicial nominations are still subject to the confirmation process in the Senate,” another Senate aide involved in the legislative push told CNN.

politics,GOP plots Pennsylvania onslaught as Democrats battle to keep ‘really difficult’ Senate seat,2024-09-08,Manu Raju,"For more on CNN’s coverage of the US Senate race in Pennsylvania, watch CNN’s “Inside Politics with Manu Raju” on Sunday at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET.﻿

Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania CNN —

Sen. Bob Casey is bracing for a GOP onslaught.

After a summer where he and his GOP opponent, David McCormick, have engaged in a brutal exchange of attacks in the marquee US Senate race in Pennsylvania, leaving the race in a dead heat, Republicans are preparing to drop more than $100 million across the airwaves in the final two months of the campaign.

The staggering sum, which accounts to roughly $40 million more than Casey and his allies are preparing so far, gives McCormick the biggest edge on the airwaves of any Senate candidate in the campaign’s home stretch. Up until this point, both sides had spent similar levels on air, with Casey holding the advantage.

“I think I’m the underdog,” Casey, a three-term incumbent with a long history in Pennsylvania politics, told CNN after a Philadelphia rally with union workers. “Those corporate super PACs that are coming in here, that have already begun to attack me all summer long, those expenditures are going to go up exponentially.”

While Casey still predicted he would pull off a November victory and contended that he didn’t “care what they spend,” he said: “I don’t have a personal super PAC funded by Wall Street billionaires. … It’s going to be a really difficult race to win.”

Casey’s comments underscore the larger Democratic struggle to keep control of the Senate. They need to hold all their seats – other than West Virginia, which is almost certain to flip to the GOP – in order to simply keep a 50-50 Senate. And that means Democrats can’t afford a slip-up in a purple state like Pennsylvania, given they already have to defend seats in red states like Ohio and Montana.

To avoid that outcome, Casey has been launching a barrage of attacks going after McCormick’s character – a tactic Democrats are using in swing states across the country in an effort to court split-ticket voters. But as Casey attacks McCormick’s tenure running a major Wall Street hedge fund, and his past residency in Connecticut, the Republican and his allies are seeking to nationalize the race and tie their foe to Vice President Kamala Harris, the border and inflation.

“The reason the race is closing is that Sen. Casey is just out of touch with Pennsylvania,” McCormick said in an interview here in an eastern Pennsylvania town where Trump won 60% of the vote in 2020. “He’s been a weak senator.”

To amplify those attacks, McCormick is benefiting from something other candidates lack: His own super PAC funded by well-heeled donors. Indeed, of the $101 million McCormick and his GOP allies plan to spend on the air, the Keystone Renewal PAC has reserved $66 million in the final two months of the campaign – more than the $64 million Casey and his allies are reserving to spend during that same timeframe, according to AdImpact data. That super PAC has been bankrolled by billionaire financiers like Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, who have donated $10 million and $2 million, respectively, according to federal records.

And McCormick has another benefit: His own deep pockets. Asked if he would pump his own cash into the campaign in the final months, McCormick noted he’s “already been a big investor,” pointing to public filings that show he spent $4 million so far on his campaign.

“I expect to continue to be an investor, and I believe in me. So I’m investing in me,” McCormick said. “But this will be the most expensive race in the country. And so I’m going to need lots of help.”

McCormick added: “I’m running against a three-term incumbent that’s been around for a long time. He’s a very big name in Pennsylvania. So I think I’m the underdog.”

The Trump and Harris factor

Both candidates have calculated that it makes sense politically to align themselves with the top of their tickets, even if some of their standard bearer’s positions put them in a difficult political spot.

McCormick, who has never held elected office before, lost the 2022 Senate primary to Dr. Mehmet Oz, who Donald Trump backed, in a fiercely contested race where the former president repeatedly berated McCormick.

But McCormick has since made amends with Trump, winning the former president’s backing and stumping with Trump at the Republican National Convention and at stops throughout Pennsylvania. Indeed, McCormick was about to take the stage at the July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when Trump told him to wait back another moment. Moments later, a gunman tried to kill the former president.

“Yeah,” McCormick said when asked here if he thinks it could have been him shot at during the rally. “I didn’t think at the time. Then, I got home at night and talked to all six of my daughters, and they were freaked out.”

Yet McCormick’s alliance with Trump has some limits.

Asked if he believed Trump’s claims that the 2020 Pennsylvania election was stolen, McCormick said he believed Joe Biden was the winner.

“One of the things I had said before was that President Biden was our president. He had won the election. I don’t believe the election was stolen,” McCormick said. “So President Trump and I don’t agree on everything, but we agree on a lot of things.”

Asked if he considered himself a MAGA Republican, McCormick said: “You know, I consider myself a Dave McCormick Republican. I have time and again, laid out my positions. My positions are very much in line with what President Trump has said on policies.”

Casey sees it differently.

“He’s genuflecting to Trump all the time,” Casey said of McCormick, pointing out that Trump attacked him as a “liberal Wall Street Republican” during the 2022 campaign, an issue spotlighted in Democratic attack ads.

Yet, Casey has to navigate his own top-of-the-ticket issues – namely Harris’ more progressive positions, including her previous support for banning the fossil-fuel extraction procedure known as fracking, an issue that carries particular resonance in Pennsylvania. Casey is now applauding Harris’ reversal – she now says she wouldn’t ban fracking – and appeared with her and President Joe Biden on the stump at last week’s Labor Day rally in Pittsburgh.

Asked why he’s aligning himself with Harris, as other vulnerable Democrats have shied away from her, Casey said: “Look, in this state, her campaign already has brought a real lift to the turnout dynamics. A lot of young voters are more engaged now than they were. She’s running a really strong campaign. I’ve known her a long time in the Senate.”

But he wouldn’t call himself a Biden-Harris Democrat, nor would he spell out the issues where he diverges from the Democratic nominee.

“I’m not going to try to itemize issues that we might have not total agreement on,” he said.

McCormick defends his tenure on Wall Street

McCormick’s success on Wall Street has become a double-edged sword in the race, as Casey launches an array of attacks on his tenure at Bridgewater Associates – particularly its investments in China while he ran the hedge fund.

From 2017-2021 – the period that McCormick ran Bridgewater – the company’s investments in China grew by 108%, including investing in a Chinese firm legally producing fentanyl.

In the interview, McCormick said that his company’s overall investment in China amounted to 3% of the firm’s global investment strategy, arguing it’s common for any such company to invest in China.

“You have 30% of things in your home that are from China,” he said, arguing that Casey’s record on immigration and border security is a reason for the fentanyl crisis rather than his company’s work. “There’s no global firm in the world that that doesn’t have exposure to China. And tens of millions of Pennsylvanians, tens of millions of Americans have investments across the globe, some of which are in China.”

But Casey said 3% is “a hell of a lot of money.” Asked if he sees the race turning on character, more than the issues, Casey said: “Well, I think it will turn on what you’ve done with your life. … So I’ve been working for the people in Pennsylvania. He’s been making money investing in China and working on Wall Street. “

McCormick shot back, saying Casey “doesn’t have a record to run on,” noting that the Democrat’s campaign spent more on attack ads than he has so far in the campaign.

“Sen. Casey is running scared,” McCormick said.

An evolution on abortion

Democrats have also been eager to spotlight past comments McCormick made in the 2022 primary. Indeed, when he was on the debate stage in 2022, he specified his view on abortion, indicating he opposed the procedure, noting: “I believe in the very rare instances there should be exceptions for life of the mother.”

Since he did not mention two other abortion exceptions – for rape and incest – that comment has been the centerpiece of a multimillion dollar Democratic ad campaign on the issue.

Asked last week why he only singled out life of the mother, and not an exception for rape or incest, McCormick told CNN: “I said before the debate, after the debate over and over again that I support all three exceptions. In the debate, I didn’t say I was against the other exceptions. I simply said that I was for that exception.”

But McCormick, who said he still opposes codifying Roe v. Wade, said he’s “not in favor of national legislation” and that the states should decide their policies rather than Congress.

Casey also has long harbored anti-abortion views despite being a Democrat – and is the son of a two-term governor, Bob Casey Sr., a staunch Catholic who signed one of the most stringent abortion laws in the country in 1989, leading to a landmark Supreme Court decision. The elder Casey was even denied a speaking slot in the 1992 Democratic convention over the issue.

And in 2002, when the younger Casey mounted an unsuccessful bid for governor, he made his position clear, saying in a radio interview at the time that his view has “always been a pro-life position.”

“My position has always been favoring the one exception – for the life of the mother,” Casey said 22 years ago.

But in the interview last week, Casey suggested that his view has changed in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision, saying that he supports “restoring the rights of Roe.”

Asked if he still considers himself to be “pro-life,” Casey said: “I don’t think those terms mean much anymore. I really think that the choice now before the American people is if you support a ban, which means you support the overturning of Roe and all that comes with it, or you support this right, which I do.”

politics,Trump’s claim terrorists are pouring over southern border does not stand up to scrutiny,2024-09-08,Peter Bergen,"At a Fox News town hall on Wednesday, former President Donald Trump previewed some of the themes that we will likely hear more from him on the campaign trail and during his September 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.

Discussing the US southern border, Trump asserted that “more terrorists have come into the United States in the last three years. And I think probably 50 years.”

As we approach the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, this seems like an odd claim to make when 19 Arab hijackers, none of whom had crossed the southern border into the US, killed almost 3,000 people, the vast majority of them in Trump’s hometown of New York City.

And if it were really the case that jihadist terrorists were pouring across America’s southern border during the past three years as Trump claimed, wouldn’t there have been, you know, some terrorist attacks in the US as a result? Or, at the very least, a lot more terrorists being arrested in the US during that same time frame?

In fact, there have been no reported terrorist attacks in the US during the past three years carried out by jihadist terrorists crossing the southern border.

Indeed, the most recent lethal terrorist attack by a jihadist terrorist happened when Trump himself was in office in 2019 when a Saudi military officer killed three American sailors at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, and he had arrived legally in the US as part of a Pentagon training program.

Meanwhile, during the past three years, 22 people have been murdered in the United States by far-right domestic terrorists in places such as Buffalo, New York, and Allen, Texas, according to data collected by New America, a research institution (where I am a vice president.)

The ordinarily voluble Trump typically doesn’t have much to say when far-right domestic terrorists perpetrate terrorism in the United States.

At the Fox town hall, Trump also claimed that there were no acts of “radical Islamic terror” while he was president. Yet, the Pensacola terrorist attack happened on Trump’s watch, as did the attack in Manhattan in 2017 by an ISIS-inspired terrorist who killed eight people using a truck as a weapon.

The ‘terrorists crossing the southern border’ trope is a 2024 remix of Trump’s call for a Muslim ban during the 2016 election campaign, which conflated Americans’ widespread concerns about immigration with their fear of terrorism, which since the 9/11 attacks has been imprinted on many American’s minds.

To be sure, there are reasonable concerns about the southern border, like the fact that, as CNN reported in June, eight Tajikistan nationals in the US who had crossed the southern border were arrested on immigration charges “following the discovery of potential ties to terrorism,” including possibly to ISIS. There was, however, no evidence these men were plotting a terrorist attack.

Also, FBI director Christopher Wray testified last year before the US Senate Judiciary Committee, “I am concerned that we are in … a heightened threat environment from foreign terrorist organizations for a whole host of reasons and obviously their ability to exploit any port of entry, including our southwest border … We have seen an increase in so-called KSTs, ‘known or suspected terrorists,’ attempting to cross over the last five years.”

It is the case that according to the US Customs and Border Protection’s most recent statistics, in 2024 so far, there were 43 “encounters” with people on the terrorism watch list on the southern border.

Also, in 2024, Customs and Border Protection Patrol had 281 encounters with people on the terrorism watchlist on the US border with Canada. Yet, Trump is not calling for draconian immigration enforcement for people crossing the Canadian border, even though so far this year around six times more people on the terrorism watch list tried to cross that border.

Also, being on the terrorism watch list doesn’t mean you are a terrorist; CBS News has reported that there are some two million people on it.

This is all a far cry from Trump’s claim on Fox that “more terrorists have come into the United States in the last three years. And I think probably 50 years” and that there was no Islamist terrorism in the US during the four years he was in office.

However, if past performance is predictive of future performance, Trump will likely make similar claims during the final weeks of the election campaign."
politics,Trump calls for modifying the 25th Amendment and says a VP “engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president” they should be removed,2024-09-07,"Kate Sullivan, Arit John","Former President Donald Trump on Saturday called for “modifying” the 25th Amendment to allow for the removal of a vice president who “lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president,” a political nonstarter and the latest escalation of his attacks on President Joe Biden and the change atop the Democratic ticket.

“If you do that with a cover-up of the president of the United States, it’s grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office, beause that’s what they did,” Trump said during a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin.

In the wake of Biden’s poor June debate performance and his decision to end his presidential campaign a month later, Trump and his Republican allies have accused Vice President Kamala Harris and top Democrats of covering up a decline in the president’s mental fitness.

The Harris campaign declined to comment on Trump’s remarks on Saturday.

The vice president has continued to defend Biden and his mental capacity, telling CNN last month that she doesn’t regret insisting in the weeks after the debate that Biden was fit to serve another four-year term.

“Not at all,” Harris told CNN’s Dana Bash in her first major TV interview since becoming the new Democratic nominee. “He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president.”

Trump’s proposal comes as he continues to grapple with the changed dynamics of the 2024 race. In the midst of his struggles to land on a consistent message to blunt Harris’ momentum, Trump has continued to criticize Biden. During his Saturday rally, the former president said it was a “miracle” the president won the 2020 Democratic primary and mocked Biden’s performance at this March’s State of the Union and their June debate.

“We’re run by stupid people — stupid, stupid people,” Trump said Saturday. “And we found that out at the debate with Joe. How did that work out?”

The 25th Amendment lays out presidential succession and the process for removing a president, which would require the support of the vice president and a majority of the president’s Cabinet. It does not address forcibly removing a vice president. Ratifying a constitutional amendment requires the support of three-fourths of US states.

Impeachment, a separate process that wouldn’t require amending the Constitution, requires a simple majority vote in the House to adopt articles of impeachment and then a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict. Trump was twice impeached by the House during his first term, but was not removed from office by the Senate.

Trump’s call to alter the 25th Amendment invokes past calls to remove him from office. Some members of the former president’s Cabinet discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove him after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

business,Google’s search business was declared to be a monopoly. Now its ad business is on trial,2024-09-09,Brian Fung,"Google hasn’t just illegally cornered the market in search — it’s squeezed online publishers and advertisers with a “trifecta” of monopolies that have harmed virtually the entire World Wide Web, the US Department of Justice said Monday in a Virginia federal courtroom.

Kicking off a high-stakes trial that could reshape the basic economics of running a website, DOJ attorneys this week — along with 17 states — are trying to convince a federal judge that Google broke US antitrust law with its powerful advertising business.

The long-awaited Google-DOJ showdown focuses on the $31 billion portion of Google’s ad business that matches website publishers with advertisers. This “stack” of technologies determines what banner ads appear on countless sites across the web.

The Biden administration’s lawsuit, filed in 2023, claims Google has used anticompetitive mergers, self-dealing and auction manipulation to reduce competition and cement its dominance, resulting in higher prices for publishers and advertisers.

“Google is not here because they’re big,” Julia Tarver Wood, a senior DOJ attorney, told District Judge Leonie Brinkema in the trial’s opening minutes Monday. “They’re here because they use that size to crush competition.”

Google has not shied away from the fight. The US government has “gerrymandered” its way to a court case, the company responded on Monday, leading to “absurd results” that don’t reflect the modern realities of internet advertising.

The government’s lawsuit “is like a time capsule, where if you break it open there would be a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster Video card,” said Karen Dunn, Google’s high-powered outside attorney who delivered the company’s opening statement before racing out to prep Vice President Kamala Harris for her Tuesday debate with former President Donald Trump.

This month’s closely watched Google ad tech trial comes weeks after another federal court handed Google what may be its biggest court defeat in company history, when a federal judge sided with state and federal officials and ruled its flagship search engine an illegal monopoly.

Now, the Justice Department is hoping for a twofer.

Google’s search engine may have been the killer app that made it a daily destination for millions of consumers, but it was the company’s advertising technology that helped Google monetize much of the rest of the web — and Google took illegal steps to thwart competition in that space, according to the states and DOJ.

From gobbling up ad-tech rivals through anticompetitive mergers to bullying businesses into using Google’s ad products, to controlling key businesses in each part of the ad-tech stack, the governments say, Google drove up prices for advertisers and choked off revenue for websites.

Tim Wolfe, a revenue executive at the media company Gannett and DOJ’s first witness, told the court that of the $15 million in fees that the publisher of USA Today pays to ad-tech companies every year, about $10 million, or two-thirds, goes to Google.

For better or for worse, he said, publishers are dependent on Google’s advertising tools, have no good alternatives to it and that it would be “a heavy lift” to try to switch away.

The company used acquisitions of companies such as DoubleClick and AdMeld to kill off threats to its advertising business early on, DOJ said Monday, and that Google’s control of multiple technologies in ad-tech stack creates conflicts that encourage Google to self-deal.

The complaint even names the US Army as one of the advertisers allegedly harmed by Google’s practices. The US government has spent $100 million since 2019 on buying internet ads, according to the lawsuit.

“One monopoly is bad enough, but a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here,” said Wood, the DOJ attorney, referring to Google’s publisher ad server business, its advertising exchange AdX, and its advertiser ad network. In each line of business, Wood said, Google has at least half, and by some measures as much as 91%, of the market. “The rules are set such that all roads lead back to Google,” Wood added.

Authorities have called for that group of businesses within Google — which is distinct from Google’s search or search ads business — to be broken up.

The ad tech case is the second of two DOJ challenges to Google’s power since the Trump administration, and the latest test of a renewed US commitment to enforcing the nation’s competition laws. But for Google, which has denied monopolizing the ad tech industry, the case is an assault on what it says are essential tools for small businesses and publishers.

Google has described the online advertising industry as vibrant and competitive, calling the government suit filed last year a misguided attempt to pick winners and losers.

In its court filings, Google has argued the DOJ suit focuses too narrowly on website advertising. On Monday, Google accused DOJ of overstating the company’s marketshare based on excluding rivals such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok. Advertisers can choose whether to use Google’s tools, or rival tools, or even divert ad spend away from websites and to other formats and platforms that don’t involve Google’s ad tech, such as on Instagram or Netflix, Google has said.

Factoring in those other sources of competition drops Google’s share of the ad exchange market from 34% to 17%, said Dunn, Google’s attorney. And if Google is broken up, she warned, it will only benefit other Big Tech giants.

“As apps become more important to digital content providers,” Google wrote in a pre-trial filing, “the amount of inventory they sell through apps, and ad tech spending to manage that inventory, increases.”

Both sides gave opening statements on a clear, sunny day at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Sitting on the dais was Brinkema, who listened quietly except to ask a rare follow-up question or to hurry things along. A Clinton appointee, Brinkema is a former Justice Department attorney who, as a judge, has also presided over numerous terrorism- and immigration-related cases.

During the Google case, Brinkema has made clear her preference for efficiency. When the Justice Department asked for a 10-week trial, she pushed for six. And on Monday, when a Google attorney kept trying to ask the same question of a witness two different ways, she interjected: “I’m going to sustain the objection before I even hear it. Let’s move it along.”

The multi-week trial could feature witness testimony from high-profile partners of Google as well as its critics. The list of potential witnesses includes current or former executives from Comcast, Disney, The New York Times and Meta, along with some high-ranking Google employees, such as YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.

That arrangement has harmed publishers and advertisers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in extra fees since 2019, according to estimates in a pre-trial filing by DOJ.

For its part, Google has argued in its filings that the price of advertising continues to fall industry-wide and that its own market share in the display advertising market has been “steadily declining since 2013.”

It’s not certain what specific penalties Google could face if Brinkema ultimately agrees with the DOJ. The trial beginning Monday is merely a first step to determine whether Google broke the law. Still, a breakup of Google’s ad tech business could potentially trigger a shakeup of the digital advertising industry and Google’s role within it.

The US government believes a breakup would create new or different financial incentives for everyone in the market. But Google has argued it might instead harm smaller websites that rely on its tools, or merely serve to benefit other large, established giants in the digital ad industry."
business,Starbucks’ new CEO wants to make Starbucks a coffee shop again,2024-09-10,Nathaniel Meyersohn,"New York CNN —

Starbucks has been on the decline, with shrinking sales as it moved from a traditional sit-down coffee shop into one where people place orders on their phones and grab a drink from the counter. Its new CEO has a plan to fix it all. And it starts with comfortable chairs.

Brian Niccol, on his second day as Starbucks’ chief, said in a letter to employees and customers that he wants to return Starbucks to its roots as a “community coffeehouse” with comfortable seats, design and a clear distinction between “to-go” and “for-here” service.

“There’s a shared sense that we have drifted from our core,” he said Tuesday. “We’re committed to elevating the in-store experience — ensuring our spaces reflect the sights, smells and sounds that define Starbucks.”

Niccol is considered the restaurant industry’s Mr. Fix-It, having engineered turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell. He will be Starbucks’ fourth CEO in two years, taking the helm amid a slump in Starbucks’ business and pressure from employees and investors.

Starbucks’ sales have fallen for two straight quarters. Some customers have expressed frustration with high prices, slow pickup orders on Starbucks’ app and lackluster food options. The company, historically considered a progressive employer, has also seen a wave of union organizing at stores stemming from frustration with working conditions, pay and benefits.

Starbucks is transitioning from a primarily brick-and-mortar company to an online-driven business. Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks’ sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States.

He said in the letter that in recent weeks has been visiting stores and talking to employees and customers. He acknowledged in his letter that, in some stores, especially the United States, they can feel “transactional, menus can feel overwhelming, product is inconsistent, the wait too long or the handoff too hectic.”

He said Starbucks will focus on “empowering” baristas, ensuring they have “tools and time to craft great drinks.” Some employees have said mobile orders can pile up and overwhelm stores, taxing workers.

Niccol, who lives in Newport Beach, California, has garnered scrutiny for not permanently relocating to Starbucks’ Seattle offices and using a corporate jet to commute back and forth.

According to the company, Niccol will spend time in stores, at headquarters in Seattle and with Starbucks employees around the world."
tech,"A Surgeon General warning label must appear on social media apps, 42 state attorneys general demand",2024-09-10,Jason Seher,"It’s hard to get 42 states to agree on much. But a bipartisan group of attorneys general on Tuesday demanded that Congress require Surgeon General warning labels on social media apps to help curtail addiction and a mental health crisis among young adults.

“As state Attorneys General, we sometimes disagree about important issues, but all of us share an abiding concern for the safety of the kids in our jurisdictions — and algorithm-driven social media platforms threaten that safety,” the 42 attorneys general said in a letter to Congress.

States have taken legal action against a number of social media companies, including Meta and TikTok. But they argue more needs to be done in Washington to alert people to the dangers social media platforms present.

“In addition to the states’ historic efforts, this ubiquitous problem requires federal action — and a surgeon general’s warning on social media platforms, though not sufficient to address the full scope of the problem, would be one consequential step toward mitigating the risk of harm to youth,” the attorneys general said.

The letter echoed much of what Surgeon General Vivek Murthy outlined in a scathing New York Times op-ed in June, that drew a direct comparison between the apps — TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and others — to cancer causing cigarettes.

Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll.

“Everyone needs to know the risk associated with these social media platforms,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “The Surgeon General’s recommendation is a strong first step in that direction, and I hope warning labels will be implemented swiftly to raise more awareness about this issue.”

James has routinely clashed with social media companies, headlining a lawsuit against Meta filed in October 2023. The suit alleged that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was causing irreparable harm to the mental health of young adults.

Appending a warning to social media apps requires Congressional approval.

In an interview with CNN in June, Murthy said he thinks “it’s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use.”

Murthy has pushed for Congress to introduce a measure to slap warning labels on apps that feed what he called a mental health crisis that leaves parents mostly powerless.

Congress has so far ignored Murthy’s plea to introduce a bill requiring warning labels. But the Senate did pass the Kids Online Safety Act this summer — a proposal backed by Microsoft, X and Snap — that would require tech companies to protect children from dangerous online content and shoulder the burden when their platforms cause harm."

The company used acquisitions of companies such as DoubleClick and AdMeld to kill off threats to its advertising business early on, DOJ said Monday, and that Google’s control of multiple technologies in ad-tech stack creates conflicts that encourage Google to self-deal.

The complaint even names the US Army as one of the advertisers allegedly harmed by Google’s practices. The US government has spent $100 million since 2019 on buying internet ads, according to the lawsuit.

“One monopoly is bad enough, but a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here,” said Wood, the DOJ attorney, referring to Google’s publisher ad server business, its advertising exchange AdX, and its advertiser ad network. In each line of business, Wood said, Google has at least half, and by some measures as much as 91%, of the market. “The rules are set such that all roads lead back to Google,” Wood added.

Authorities have called for that group of businesses within Google — which is distinct from Google’s search or search ads business — to be broken up.

The ad tech case is the second of two DOJ challenges to Google’s power since the Trump administration, and the latest test of a renewed US commitment to enforcing the nation’s competition laws. But for Google, which has denied monopolizing the ad tech industry, the case is an assault on what it says are essential tools for small businesses and publishers.

Google has described the online advertising industry as vibrant and competitive, calling the government suit filed last year a misguided attempt to pick winners and losers.

In its court filings, Google has argued the DOJ suit focuses too narrowly on website advertising. On Monday, Google accused DOJ of overstating the company’s marketshare based on excluding rivals such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok. Advertisers can choose whether to use Google’s tools, or rival tools, or even divert ad spend away from websites and to other formats and platforms that don’t involve Google’s ad tech, such as on Instagram or Netflix, Google has said.

Factoring in those other sources of competition drops Google’s share of the ad exchange market from 34% to 17%, said Dunn, Google’s attorney. And if Google is broken up, she warned, it will only benefit other Big Tech giants.

“As apps become more important to digital content providers,” Google wrote in a pre-trial filing, “the amount of inventory they sell through apps, and ad tech spending to manage that inventory, increases.”

Both sides gave opening statements on a clear, sunny day at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Sitting on the dais was Brinkema, who listened quietly except to ask a rare follow-up question or to hurry things along. A Clinton appointee, Brinkema is a former Justice Department attorney who, as a judge, has also presided over numerous terrorism- and immigration-related cases.

During the Google case, Brinkema has made clear her preference for efficiency. When the Justice Department asked for a 10-week trial, she pushed for six. And on Monday, when a Google attorney kept trying to ask the same question of a witness two different ways, she interjected: “I’m going to sustain the objection before I even hear it. Let’s move it along.”

The multi-week trial could feature witness testimony from high-profile partners of Google as well as its critics. The list of potential witnesses includes current or former executives from Comcast, Disney, The New York Times and Meta, along with some high-ranking Google employees, such as YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.

That arrangement has harmed publishers and advertisers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in extra fees since 2019, according to estimates in a pre-trial filing by DOJ.

For its part, Google has argued in its filings that the price of advertising continues to fall industry-wide and that its own market share in the display advertising market has been “steadily declining since 2013.”

It’s not certain what specific penalties Google could face if Brinkema ultimately agrees with the DOJ. The trial beginning Monday is merely a first step to determine whether Google broke the law. Still, a breakup of Google’s ad tech business could potentially trigger a shakeup of the digital advertising industry and Google’s role within it.

The US government believes a breakup would create new or different financial incentives for everyone in the market. But Google has argued it might instead harm smaller websites that rely on its tools, or merely serve to benefit other large, established giants in the digital ad industry."
business,Google’s search business was declared to be a monopoly. Now its ad business is on trial,2024-09-09,Brian Fung,"Google hasn’t just illegally cornered the market in search — it’s squeezed online publishers and advertisers with a “trifecta” of monopolies that have harmed virtually the entire World Wide Web, the US Department of Justice said Monday in a Virginia federal courtroom.

Kicking off a high-stakes trial that could reshape the basic economics of running a website, DOJ attorneys this week — along with 17 states — are trying to convince a federal judge that Google broke US antitrust law with its powerful advertising business.

The long-awaited Google-DOJ showdown focuses on the $31 billion portion of Google’s ad business that matches website publishers with advertisers. This “stack” of technologies determines what banner ads appear on countless sites across the web.

The Biden administration’s lawsuit, filed in 2023, claims Google has used anticompetitive mergers, self-dealing and auction manipulation to reduce competition and cement its dominance, resulting in higher prices for publishers and advertisers.

“Google is not here because they’re big,” Julia Tarver Wood, a senior DOJ attorney, told District Judge Leonie Brinkema in the trial’s opening minutes Monday. “They’re here because they use that size to crush competition.”

Google has not shied away from the fight. The US government has “gerrymandered” its way to a court case, the company responded on Monday, leading to “absurd results” that don’t reflect the modern realities of internet advertising.

The government’s lawsuit “is like a time capsule, where if you break it open there would be a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster Video card,” said Karen Dunn, Google’s high-powered outside attorney who delivered the company’s opening statement before racing out to prep Vice President Kamala Harris for her Tuesday debate with former President Donald Trump.

This month’s closely watched Google ad tech trial comes weeks after another federal court handed Google what may be its biggest court defeat in company history, when a federal judge sided with state and federal officials and ruled its flagship search engine an illegal monopoly.

Now, the Justice Department is hoping for a twofer.

Google’s search engine may have been the killer app that made it a daily destination for millions of consumers, but it was the company’s advertising technology that helped Google monetize much of the rest of the web — and Google took illegal steps to thwart competition in that space, according to the states and DOJ.

From gobbling up ad-tech rivals through anticompetitive mergers to bullying businesses into using Google’s ad products, to controlling key businesses in each part of the ad-tech stack, the governments say, Google drove up prices for advertisers and choked off revenue for websites.

Tim Wolfe, a revenue executive at the media company Gannett and DOJ’s first witness, told the court that of the $15 million in fees that the publisher of USA Today pays to ad-tech companies every year, about $10 million, or two-thirds, goes to Google.

business,Starbucks’ new CEO wants to make Starbucks a coffee shop again,2024-09-10,Nathaniel Meyersohn,"New York CNN —

Starbucks has been on the decline, with shrinking sales as it moved from a traditional sit-down coffee shop into one where people place orders on their phones and grab a drink from the counter. Its new CEO has a plan to fix it all. And it starts with comfortable chairs.

Brian Niccol, on his second day as Starbucks’ chief, said in a letter to employees and customers that he wants to return Starbucks to its roots as a “community coffeehouse” with comfortable seats, design and a clear distinction between “to-go” and “for-here” service.

“There’s a shared sense that we have drifted from our core,” he said Tuesday. “We’re committed to elevating the in-store experience — ensuring our spaces reflect the sights, smells and sounds that define Starbucks.”

Niccol is considered the restaurant industry’s Mr. Fix-It, having engineered turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell. He will be Starbucks’ fourth CEO in two years, taking the helm amid a slump in Starbucks’ business and pressure from employees and investors.

Starbucks’ sales have fallen for two straight quarters. Some customers have expressed frustration with high prices, slow pickup orders on Starbucks’ app and lackluster food options. The company, historically considered a progressive employer, has also seen a wave of union organizing at stores stemming from frustration with working conditions, pay and benefits.

Starbucks is transitioning from a primarily brick-and-mortar company to an online-driven business. Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks’ sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States.

He said in the letter that in recent weeks has been visiting stores and talking to employees and customers. He acknowledged in his letter that, in some stores, especially the United States, they can feel “transactional, menus can feel overwhelming, product is inconsistent, the wait too long or the handoff too hectic.”

He said Starbucks will focus on “empowering” baristas, ensuring they have “tools and time to craft great drinks.” Some employees have said mobile orders can pile up and overwhelm stores, taxing workers.

Niccol, who lives in Newport Beach, California, has garnered scrutiny for not permanently relocating to Starbucks’ Seattle offices and using a corporate jet to commute back and forth.

According to the company, Niccol will spend time in stores, at headquarters in Seattle and with Starbucks employees around the world."

tech,"A Surgeon General warning label must appear on social media apps, 42 state attorneys general demand",2024-09-10,Jason Seher,"It’s hard to get 42 states to agree on much. But a bipartisan group of attorneys general on Tuesday demanded that Congress require Surgeon General warning labels on social media apps to help curtail addiction and a mental health crisis among young adults.

“As state Attorneys General, we sometimes disagree about important issues, but all of us share an abiding concern for the safety of the kids in our jurisdictions — and algorithm-driven social media platforms threaten that safety,” the 42 attorneys general said in a letter to Congress.

States have taken legal action against a number of social media companies, including Meta and TikTok. But they argue more needs to be done in Washington to alert people to the dangers social media platforms present.

“In addition to the states’ historic efforts, this ubiquitous problem requires federal action — and a surgeon general’s warning on social media platforms, though not sufficient to address the full scope of the problem, would be one consequential step toward mitigating the risk of harm to youth,” the attorneys general said.

The letter echoed much of what Surgeon General Vivek Murthy outlined in a scathing New York Times op-ed in June, that drew a direct comparison between the apps — TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and others — to cancer causing cigarettes.

Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll.

“Everyone needs to know the risk associated with these social media platforms,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “The Surgeon General’s recommendation is a strong first step in that direction, and I hope warning labels will be implemented swiftly to raise more awareness about this issue.”

James has routinely clashed with social media companies, headlining a lawsuit against Meta filed in October 2023. The suit alleged that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was causing irreparable harm to the mental health of young adults.

Appending a warning to social media apps requires Congressional approval.

In an interview with CNN in June, Murthy said he thinks “it’s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use.”

Murthy has pushed for Congress to introduce a measure to slap warning labels on apps that feed what he called a mental health crisis that leaves parents mostly powerless.

Congress has so far ignored Murthy’s plea to introduce a bill requiring warning labels. But the Senate did pass the Kids Online Safety Act this summer — a proposal backed by Microsoft, X and Snap — that would require tech companies to protect children from dangerous online content and shoulder the burden when their platforms cause harm."

business,BMW downgrades 2024 outlook over brake issues and weak demand in China,2024-09-10,Unknown,"BMW cut its profit margin forecast for the year Tuesday due to sluggish demand in China, its key market, and problems related to a braking system supplied by Continental, sending the carmaker’s shares close to a two-year low.

The German luxury carmaker said delivery hold-ups linked to the braking system would have a negative effect on sales in the second half of the year, adding that more than 1.5 million cars were affected.

Around 1.2 million of those vehicles have been already delivered to clients and can be remotely checked for faults via over-the-air software, but the remaining 320,000 vehicles cannot be handed over to the buyers for now, BMW said.

Overall, BMW said, it will incur “a high three-digit-million amount” in warranty costs in the third quarter as a result.

The company said it expects its margin on earnings before interest and tax to be between 6% and 7% for 2024, having previously forecast a figure between 8% and 10%.

In a separate statement, car parts maker Continental said that only a “small proportion” of the braking systems it produces and supplies to BMW would be partially replaced due to an electronic component that it said is possibly impaired.

BMW also flagged ongoing muted demand in China affecting sales in the country, joining the automakers facing difficulties in the world’s second-biggest economy, which is also the world’s largest auto market.

“Despite stimulus measures from the government, consumer sentiment remains weak,” BMW said."

New York CNN —

Apple is wedging AI into its phones like a new U2 album no one asked for.

Whether you’re an Apple fangirl who has already reserved the $1,200 iPhone 16 Pro Max or a normie trapped in too many yearslong blue-bubble-only group chats, at some point soon you’ll end up with artificial intelligence features built right into your phone.

It hardly matters that the real-world applications for most AI products are, so far, both underwhelming and unreliable. In the absence of any other major innovations, Apple is betting even nascent AI tools will inspire folks to upgrade and usher in a “super cycle” of sales for the next year.

However, given the “Apple Intelligence” highlights the company previewed in June and officially rolled out Monday, investors and customers alike may want to temper their expectations. Even Apple seemed to hedge a bit: It never mentioned the words “artificial intelligence.”

The new tools look … fine. Cute, even. They are exactly what we’ve come to expect from Apple — intuitive, friendly, mostly not creepy. With iPhone 16, you’ll get a smarter, more human-sounding Siri. You’ll be able to generate bespoke emojis by typing something like “heart eyes zombie eating pizza.” You can point your camera at a dog in the park and the phone can tell you (approximately) what breed it is.

But the AI tools on offer right now are firmly in the “nice to have” category — not the “must-have” that would spur someone to drop a grand on a new device.

“Despite the unknowns of feature timing and global rollout, I believe consumers will get excited about these AI features,” tweeted Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, ahead of the phone’s formal unveiling at Apple HQ. Munster expects iPhone sales will exceed Wall Street’s estimates in the coming quarters.

Of course, the way iPhone cycles go, even a ho-hum iPhone 16 should do decent sales, given that many customers have been holding onto older phones and are due for an upgrade anyway. That’s still a positive — brand loyalty is one of Apple’s biggest strengths, which is partly why Apple is taking its time to integrate AI slowly and transparently (having learned its lesson from the 2014 U2 album debacle).

For all the AI hype, there was very little talk of ""AI."" Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Just don’t call it ‘AI’

For an event built around unveiling Apple’s first AI-powered iPhone, there was one striking absence over the two-hour presentation: the words “artificial intelligence.”

Instead, CEO Tim Cook and other company spokespeople referred only to their “intelligent” features.

To be clear: “Apple Intelligence” is Apple’s proprietary AI. But Apple — the most brand-conscious company on the planet — understands something that often gets lost in the bot-pilled bubble of Silicon Valley: Regular people don’t trust AI.

While developers in Silicon Valley and investors on Wall Street have gone all-in on a future powered by bots, the people who are meant to be buying these AI-powered devices need a little more convincing. (And even Wall Street enthusiasts are increasingly losing patience with the technology’s lack of ROI.)

Over the summer, a study published in the Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management found that describing a product as “AI-powered” tends to lower a customer’s intention to buy it.

It’s not hard to see why: Our interactions with chatbots and AI image generators have quickly taught us to be skeptical of their stilted, often flatly incorrect renderings. When something looks inauthentic, we now say it looks like it was generated by a bot. When we hear a politician fumble their stump speech, we quip that it sounds like ChatGPT wrote it.

The always image-conscious Apple knows better than to fall into the “AI” trap, even if its whole pitch for the new iPhone is AI."

tech,Australia plans a minimum age limit for social media use,2024-09-10,Unknown,"Australia intends to set a minimum age limit for children to use social media, citing concerns about mental and physical health. The plan has sparked backlash from digital rights advocates who warn the measure could drive dangerous online activity underground.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his center-left government would run an age verification trial before introducing age minimum laws for social media this year.

Albanese didn’t specify an age but said it would likely be between 14 and 16.

“I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts,” Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

“We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social media is causing social harm,” he added.

The law would put Australia among the first countries in the world to impose an age restriction on social media. Previous attempts, including by the European Union, have failed following complaints about reducing the online rights of minors.

Meta (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram, which has a self-imposed minimum age of 13, said it wanted to empower young people to benefit from its platforms and equip parents with the tools to support them “instead of just cutting off access.”

Australia has one of the world’s most online populations, with four-fifths of its 26 million people on social media, according to tech industry figures. Three-quarters of Australians aged 12 to 17 had used YouTube or Instagram, a 2023 University of Sydney study found.

Albanese announced the age restriction plan against the backdrop of a parliamentary inquiry into social media’s effects on society, which has heard sometimes emotional testimony of mental health impacts on teenagers.

But the inquiry has also heard concerns about whether an age limit would inadvertently harm younger people by encouraging them to hide their online activity.

“This knee-jerk move … threatens to create serious harm by excluding young people from meaningful, healthy participation in the digital world, potentially driving them to lower-quality online spaces,” said Daniel Angus, director of the Queensland University of Technology Digital Media Research Centre.

Australia’s own internet regulator, the eSafety Commissioner, warned in a June submission to the inquiry that “restriction-based approaches may limit young people’s access to critical support” and push them to “less regulated non-mainstream services.”

The commissioner said in a statement Tuesday that it would “continue working with stakeholders across government and the community to further refine Australia’s approach to online harms,” which can “threaten safety across a range of platforms at any age, both before and after the mid-teen years.”

DIGI, an industry body representing social media platforms, said the government should listen to “expert voices such as the eSafety Commissioner … mental health experts, as well as LGBTQIA+ and other marginalized groups who have expressed concerns about bans so that we’re not unintentionally pushing our kids into unsafe, less visible parts of the Internet.”"
tech,Australia plans a minimum age limit for social media use,2024-09-10,Unknown,"Australia intends to set a minimum age limit for children to use social media, citing concerns about mental and physical health. The plan has sparked backlash from digital rights advocates who warn the measure could drive dangerous online activity underground.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his center-left government would run an age verification trial before introducing age minimum laws for social media this year.

Albanese didn’t specify an age but said it would likely be between 14 and 16.

“I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts,” Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

“We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social media is causing social harm,” he added.

The law would put Australia among the first countries in the world to impose an age restriction on social media. Previous attempts, including by the European Union, have failed following complaints about reducing the online rights of minors.

economy,What Trump and Harris’ economic proposals mean for you,2024-09-10,"Elisabeth Buchwald, Matt Egan","New York CNN —

In poll after poll, Americans have indicated the economy is their top concern as they prepare to cast votes this election.

Dealing with high inflation for years will do that to you. Although inflation has cooled significantly since it peaked at a 40-year high in 2022, Americans are paying around 20% more for goods and services now compared to before the pandemic, according to Consumer Price Index data.

On the flip side, the job market, which had been the greatest source of strength in the US economy after the pandemic, has been flashing warning signs lately. The unemployment rate is hovering near three-year highs, and employers are cutting back on hiring, with the number of job openings across the economy recently falling to the lowest level since January 2021, according to the Labor Department.

In response to the anxieties Americans have about the economy, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have put vastly different policy proposals on the table, which they’re set to highlight during Tuesday night’s presidential debate. Their contrasting approaches could have far-reaching effects on the economy – and for you.

Here’s a look at what could happen to inflation, jobs and the deficit if Trump or Harris win in November.

Inflation and jobs

Trump’s tariff policy would controversially charge dramatically higher import taxes on practically everything that comes into the country’s ports from overseas. That could raise revenue for the government — but it could also cause Americans to pay higher prices for goods and services. Goldman Sachs economists estimated that every one percentage point increase in the effective tariff rate could raise core inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index by a tenth of a percentage point. And Trump is talking about 10% to 20% tariffs on most things except Chinese goods — which would get a 60% tariff.

Meanwhile, Trump promises to drill a lot more oil, a key cost for many businesses, to bring down prices — but there’s an open question over whether he could achieve that. The United States is already pumping more oil than any nation in history.

Additionally, the unprecedented immigration crackdown Trump has vowed if he returns to the White House could also lead to higher inflation, economists say, despite Trump recently asserting prices would “come down dramatically and come down fast” as a result.

If mass deportations occur, businesses could struggle to fill open positions, forcing them to raise wages and pass those costs to consumers.

Even deporting 1.3 million workers, which is lower than the 10 to 20 million deportations Trump has advocated for, would be an “inflation shock” that lifts inflation by 1.3 percentage points after three years, according to research presented at the Peterson Institute for International Economics by Australian economist Warwick McKibbin. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, would be 2.1 percentage points lower – a dramatic decrease.

If 7.5 million workers were deported, inflation would be a staggering 7.4 percentage points higher and GDP would be 12 points lower after three years, the research found.

Harris has warned that the immigration system is “broken” and her campaign pledges on its website to bring back the bipartisan border security bill. Yet Harris has not pledged mass deportations or a crackdown anything like what Trump has called for.

That’s why Goldman Sachs told clients recently it expected only a “modest further reduction” in net immigration under a Harris presidency.

The supply of workers from immigration will be 10,000 per month lower if Trump wins with a divided government than if Harris becomes president, Goldman Sachs estimates. If Republicans sweep in November, Goldman expects America’s supply of workers from immigration would be 30,000 lower than if Harris becomes president.

But Harris’ policies aren’t inflation-proof.

The first-time homeowner tax credit and tripling of the child tax credit for newborns she’s proposed could leave consumers with more money to spend on goods and services. But as a result, that could increase the prices they pay for them.

Harris has also proposed a plan that her team says would result in 3 million housing units. The issue is the timing: If the first-time homebuyer credit goes into effect before more new units are available, it could cause home prices to spike.

“The problem right now is too many people chasing too few houses,” said Justin Wolfers, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “The solution to that is not to give people more money to buy houses. If you don’t fix the supply side, then everyone you helped is hurting someone else.”

One potential wildcard for inflation is the two candidates’ different approaches to the Federal Reserve, the independent central bank tasked with controlling inflation. Harris has promised a hands-off approach, while Trump has suggested the president should have influence in decision-making — an argument he later walked back.

The deficit

No matter who wins in November, expect to see the federal budget deficit grow significantly.

A budget deficit occurs when the government spends more than the revenue it collects. Currently, the US government is running a $1.5 trillion budget deficit, according to Treasury Department data. The nonpartisan Penn-Wharton Budget Model projects it will increase to $2.1 trillion by 2034 if the status quo is maintained.

The size of the deficit has big implications for Americans. The higher the deficit, the riskier it becomes to hold US debt, which tends to grow when the deficit does. As a result, the government could have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money. That can reduce the amount of investment in other programs the government can make.

Higher interest rates on government debt, typically sold off in bonds and Treasury notes, could also cause borrowing costs to increase for Americans since the interest rates are connected to interest rates paid to invest in government debt.

Several of the tax policies Trump is proposing would substantially limit the amount of money the government collects. Those policies include permanently extending individual and corporate provisions from his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire next year. That, among other things, would keep the top tax rate individuals pay at 37% compared to 39.6% before it went into effect.

He’s also proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 15% versus the current 21% for companies that make products domestically and ending taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors as well as tips for service workers.

Trump says he plans to pay for those initiatives with his tariffs. But the revenue the government would collect from the tariffs would not be enough to fully offset the lost tax revenue. The Penn-Wharton Budget Model, which doesn’t take into account new proposals Trump made last week as well as ending taxes on tips, estimates that his proposals could cause the deficit to increase by an additional $5.8 trillion over the next 10 years.

The model also doesn’t factor in savings that could come from a commission Trump announced he’d form led by Elon Musk to cut down on wasteful government government spending.

Meanwhile, the tax proposals Harris has put forth so far mostly involve imposing higher taxes, which would have a positive impact on the deficit. For instance, she’s endorsed raising the top individual income tax rate to 44.6% and the top long-term capital gains tax rate to 28% versus the current 20%. And on the corporate side, she’s in favor of raising the tax rate to 28%.

But the additional tax revenue the government could collect from this could be offset by the hefty tax credits she’s proposed, which include expanding the child tax credit and offering a $25,000 first-time homebuyer credit.

And like Trump, she’s promised to end taxes on tips. She’s also pledged not to raise taxes on households making less than $400,000 annually. Both would growon the deficit.

Taken together, the Penn Wharton Budget model estimates Harris’ proposals could increase the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion by 2034.

Neither candidate has proposed a credible solution to the country’s fiscal mess, said Joshua Gotbaum, a visiting economics scholar at the Brookings Institution. “But what Harris has proposed would create much less of a mess,” he said."

tech,Apple and Google: European Court of Justice just delivered multi-billion-dollar blows to tech companies,2024-09-10,Hanna Ziady,"London CNN —

Apple has lost its fight to dodge a €13 billion ($14.4 billion) tax bill following a ruling by Europe’s top court Tuesday, which dealt a blow to the world’s most valuable company just a day after the iPhone maker unveiled a host of product upgrades to boost sales.

The European Court of Justice also upheld a €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) antitrust fine against Google, in a separate decision.

The two ECJ rulings are final, which means the companies cannot appeal them.

The decisions highlight the European Union’s tough stance on Big Tech, which in recent years has extended to enacting sweeping regulations to curb the power of major tech companies.

In the ruling against Apple, the ECJ upheld a 2016 decision by the European Commission, which found that Ireland had granted Apple unlawful state aid that it was required to recover. According to estimates by the EU’s executive arm, Ireland had given Apple “illegal tax benefits” worth €13 billion.

According to Alex Haffner, a competition partner at London-based law firm Fladgate, Apple will now have to “forgo” €13 billion that had been kept in an escrow account pending the outcome of the case.

“Perhaps of more relevance will be the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their… muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,” he added.

The tax case against Apple was part of a crackdown by the EU’s now outgoing antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on deals between multinationals and EU countries that regulators saw as unfair state aid.

The Commission said at the time that Apple had benefited from two Irish tax rulings for more than two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014.

Apple challenged the ruling, and the EU’s General Court — the ECJ’s lower-level court — upheld the challenge in 2020, saying regulators had not met the legal standard to show that Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.

But on Tuesday, the ECJ’s higher Court of Justice set aside the judgment of the General Court and sided with the Commission.

“Today is a huge win for European citizens and tax justice,” Vestager said in a statement Tuesday. “The Commission will continue its work on harmful tax competition and aggressive tax planning.”

Apple, meanwhile, said it was “disappointed” with the decision. “We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal,” a company spokesperson added in a statement.

Apple said it had paid more than $20 billion in tax in the United States on the same profits that the Commission argued should have been taxed in Ireland.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

In a statement on the ruling, the Irish government said: “The Irish position has always been that Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers.”

Google fine upheld

Separately, the court dismissed an appeal lodged by Google and its parent Alphabet against the €2.4 billion fine levied by the Commission in 2017.

Google was fined for abusing its dominant position in online search by favoring its own price comparison shopping service over those of competitors in more than a dozen European countries.

At the time, Vestager said Google’s behavior “denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation” by smaller rivals.

The Commission’s decision was upheld by the General Court but appealed by the companies. That appeal was dismissed Tuesday, and Google was ordered to also pay the Commission’s legal fees. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) were unchanged in premarket trading.

“We are disappointed with the decision of the Court,” a Google spokesperson said, pointing to changes the company had made to shopping ads in Europe in 2017 to comply with the Commission’s decision. The new approach had generated “billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,” the spokesperson added.

In her statement, Vestager said the case against Google was a “catalyst for change,” challenging the notion that “digital companies should be left to operate freely.”

“It demonstrated that even the most powerful tech companies could be held accountable,” she said."

business,ABC News steps into the spotlight with high stakes Trump-Harris debate,2024-09-10,Hadas Gold,"New York CNN —

As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump take the stage Tuesday night in Philadelphia in their first face-to-face meeting, the spotlight will also shine on the host of the debate: ABC News.

Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis will have a much different view in front of them than when ABC News first secured the high-stakes presidential debate in May. Since then, Harris has become the Democratic nominee, shaking up not just the race for the White House but also the negotiation process ahead of the televised faceoff.

It’s a big test for the Disney-owned network in what is the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump of the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign. Everything ABC News does, from the moderators’ questions to the lighting will be heavily scrutinized by the candidates and the public during the 90-minute showdown.

In the weeks leading up to Tuesday night’s debate, a behind the scenes drama has played out at ABC News as network executives sought to lock down the ground rules and format for the match up.

ABC had planned to mostly mirror the rules used by CNN in its presidential debate in June between President Joe Biden and Trump, eschewing a live audience and muting the candidates’ microphones while their rival is speaking — a rule initially requested by Biden’s team prior to the CNN debate.

But Harris’ team wanted the mics hot the entire night and demanded the network change the rule. Some of Harris’ most memorable moments in previous debates and in Senate hearings have come during cross talk. Her campaign, according to people familiar with the matter, believed that muting the microphones will make Trump appear more disciplined, and expressed frustration that ABC was not willing to budge on the rule.

The issue presented a thorny dilemma for ABC. While Democrats had selected a new candidate since first agreeing to host the debate, Republicans had not. And Trump’s campaign had already accepted the debate rules as sent out by ABC News’ general counsel. The microphones remained the final sticking point, even as ABC began erecting its physical presence at the National Constitution Center.

But ABC executives remained confident both candidates would show up, and ultimately, the Harris campaign relented. In a letter to ABC accepting the rules, the Harris campaign wrote, “we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format. We do not want to jeopardize the debate.”

The network, however, seemed to leave open the possibility that it could reconsider muting the microphones under certain circumstances, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. ABC News offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, the network may choose to turn both mics on so that the millions of viewers watching at home can hear the exchange, the person said. ABC’s moderators would discourage the candidates from interrupting one other and explain to viewers what is being said, according to this person.

ABC News, however, has pushed back on the notion that the microphones will be unmuted, saying in a statement last week: “Beyond the debate rules published today, which were mutually agreed upon by two campaigns on May 15th, we have made no other agreements. We look forward to moderating the presidential debate next Tuesday.”

But there will be another opportunity for the public to understand any exchanges made inaudible during the telecast. Unlike at the CNN debate, a pool of reporters who cover the candidates for major news organizations will be present in the debate studio, able to hear and report on what both sides are saying, the person added. ABC News declined to comment.

Big moment amid leadership shakeup

Presidential debates are major events for the network that puts them on. Not only are the contests significant investments, but the broadcasts attract huge ratings and are often some of the most watched events in a network’s history.

For ABC News, the debate comes at a pivotal moment. Last month, parent company Disney appointed Almin Karamehmedovic, the top producer of “World News Tonight,” as the network’s next president. His appointment comes after former president Kim Godwin abruptly stepped down in May, capping a tumultuous three-year run at the outlet after staffers said her polarizing leadership led to plummeting employee morale. For Karamehmedovic, a successful debate and big ratings could offer a big boost to staff morale.

ABC will also be closely scrutinized by Trump and his allies. In the days ahead of the debate, Trump has attacked the network, questioning its impartiality. And while Trump has sharply assailed the news media, calling journalists the “enemy of the people,” he has had some particular gripes with ABC.

“ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week. “They’re very nasty, and I think a lot of people are going to be watching to see how nasty and how unfair they are.”

Trump has also baselessly suggested that Dana Walden, the Disney Entertainment co-chair who technically has ABC News in her portfolio and has been friends with Harris for years, would somehow give vice president the questions ahead of time. The network has previously said that Walden has no editorial control over ABC News.

Trump is also suing George Stephanopoulos over the ABC News anchor’s assertion that a jury concluded Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll. (A Manhattan federal jury last year found that Trump sexually abused Carroll and held him liable for battery).

And last month, Trump clashed with ABC senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott as she incisively questioned the former president during an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention over his past statements on race, calling Scott “nasty.”

Unlike some of their ABC News colleagues though, Trump has not gone after Muir or Davis — the latter of whom has never interviewed Trump.

Both Muir and Davis are experienced primary debate moderators, but neither has moderated a presidential debate between the Democratic and Republican candidates. Muir, the highest rated nightly news network anchor, has experience with Trump, scoring the first interview with the former president after his inauguration. Tuesday is an even bigger moment for Davis. Though she has moderated primary debates in the past and anchors ABC’s nightly streaming newscast, as well as the broadcaster’s Sunday newscast, she’s lesser known to the public.

But regardless of the moderators’ history, their performance on Tuesday will inevitably come under scrutiny, particularly over the question of whether to fact check the candidates – or not – in real time.

“I don’t think it’s a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ proposition,” ABC News political director Rick Klein told The New York Times this week. “We’re not making a commitment to fact-check everything, or fact-check nothing, in either direction. We’re there to keep a conversation going, and to facilitate a good solid debate, and that entails a lot of things in terms of asking questions, moving the conversation along, making sure that it’s civilized.”

business,ABC News steps into the spotlight with high stakes Trump-Harris debate,2024-09-10,Hadas Gold,"New York CNN —

As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump take the stage Tuesday night in Philadelphia in their first face-to-face meeting, the spotlight will also shine on the host of the debate: ABC News.

Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis will have a much different view in front of them than when ABC News first secured the high-stakes presidential debate in May. Since then, Harris has become the Democratic nominee, shaking up not just the race for the White House but also the negotiation process ahead of the televised faceoff.

It’s a big test for the Disney-owned network in what is the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump of the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign. Everything ABC News does, from the moderators’ questions to the lighting will be heavily scrutinized by the candidates and the public during the 90-minute showdown.

In the weeks leading up to Tuesday night’s debate, a behind the scenes drama has played out at ABC News as network executives sought to lock down the ground rules and format for the match up.

ABC had planned to mostly mirror the rules used by CNN in its presidential debate in June between President Joe Biden and Trump, eschewing a live audience and muting the candidates’ microphones while their rival is speaking — a rule initially requested by Biden’s team prior to the CNN debate.

But Harris’ team wanted the mics hot the entire night and demanded the network change the rule. Some of Harris’ most memorable moments in previous debates and in Senate hearings have come during cross talk. Her campaign, according to people familiar with the matter, believed that muting the microphones will make Trump appear more disciplined, and expressed frustration that ABC was not willing to budge on the rule.

The issue presented a thorny dilemma for ABC. While Democrats had selected a new candidate since first agreeing to host the debate, Republicans had not. And Trump’s campaign had already accepted the debate rules as sent out by ABC News’ general counsel. The microphones remained the final sticking point, even as ABC began erecting its physical presence at the National Constitution Center.

But ABC executives remained confident both candidates would show up, and ultimately, the Harris campaign relented. In a letter to ABC accepting the rules, the Harris campaign wrote, “we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format. We do not want to jeopardize the debate.”

The network, however, seemed to leave open the possibility that it could reconsider muting the microphones under certain circumstances, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. ABC News offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, the network may choose to turn both mics on so that the millions of viewers watching at home can hear the exchange, the person said. ABC’s moderators would discourage the candidates from interrupting one other and explain to viewers what is being said, according to this person.

ABC News, however, has pushed back on the notion that the microphones will be unmuted, saying in a statement last week: “Beyond the debate rules published today, which were mutually agreed upon by two campaigns on May 15th, we have made no other agreements. We look forward to moderating the presidential debate next Tuesday.”

But there will be another opportunity for the public to understand any exchanges made inaudible during the telecast. Unlike at the CNN debate, a pool of reporters who cover the candidates for major news organizations will be present in the debate studio, able to hear and report on what both sides are saying, the person added. ABC News declined to comment.

Big moment amid leadership shakeup

Presidential debates are major events for the network that puts them on. Not only are the contests significant investments, but the broadcasts attract huge ratings and are often some of the most watched events in a network’s history.

For ABC News, the debate comes at a pivotal moment. Last month, parent company Disney appointed Almin Karamehmedovic, the top producer of “World News Tonight,” as the network’s next president. His appointment comes after former president Kim Godwin abruptly stepped down in May, capping a tumultuous three-year run at the outlet after staffers said her polarizing leadership led to plummeting employee morale. For Karamehmedovic, a successful debate and big ratings could offer a big boost to staff morale.

ABC will also be closely scrutinized by Trump and his allies. In the days ahead of the debate, Trump has attacked the network, questioning its impartiality. And while Trump has sharply assailed the news media, calling journalists the “enemy of the people,” he has had some particular gripes with ABC.

“ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week. “They’re very nasty, and I think a lot of people are going to be watching to see how nasty and how unfair they are.”

Trump has also baselessly suggested that Dana Walden, the Disney Entertainment co-chair who technically has ABC News in her portfolio and has been friends with Harris for years, would somehow give vice president the questions ahead of time. The network has previously said that Walden has no editorial control over ABC News.

Trump is also suing George Stephanopoulos over the ABC News anchor’s assertion that a jury concluded Trump had “raped” E. Jean Carroll. (A Manhattan federal jury last year found that Trump sexually abused Carroll and held him liable for battery).

And last month, Trump clashed with ABC senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott as she incisively questioned the former president during an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention over his past statements on race, calling Scott “nasty.”

Unlike some of their ABC News colleagues though, Trump has not gone after Muir or Davis — the latter of whom has never interviewed Trump.

Both Muir and Davis are experienced primary debate moderators, but neither has moderated a presidential debate between the Democratic and Republican candidates. Muir, the highest rated nightly news network anchor, has experience with Trump, scoring the first interview with the former president after his inauguration. Tuesday is an even bigger moment for Davis. Though she has moderated primary debates in the past and anchors ABC’s nightly streaming newscast, as well as the broadcaster’s Sunday newscast, she’s lesser known to the public.

But regardless of the moderators’ history, their performance on Tuesday will inevitably come under scrutiny, particularly over the question of whether to fact check the candidates – or not – in real time.

tech,Apple’s new AirPods are also hearing aids. Can they really save you thousands of dollars?,2024-09-10,Samantha Delouya,"During its glossy product announcement event on Tuesday, Apple unveiled a new role for its latest AirPods Pro model: medical device. The company said the wireless headphones will double as clinical-grade over-the-counter hearing aids for those who need them.

“We’re adding this groundbreaking capability to help more than 1 billion people living with mild to moderate hearing loss,” said Sumbul Ahmad Desai, Apple’s vice president of health.

Apple said its hearing aid feature will boost frequencies “so sounds are clearer and more vibrant to your ears.” The company also said the feature will use “machine learning to make real-time adjustments as you go about your day.”

Prescription hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars. At $249, Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 may be significantly cheaper and more accessible for those who have suffered hearing loss — but they won’t work for everyone. Here’s what you need to know:

Apple’s announcement follows FDA changes

Close to 30 million US adults have some degree of hearing loss, but only about one-fifth of those people seek assistance for the issue, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.

For people with untreated hearing loss, using hearing aids can reduce the rate of cognitive decline and may lower the risk of depression, according to the FDA. However, experts have said that the high cost of doctor visits and hearing aids kept some from seeking treatment.

Apple’s announcement comes two years after the FDA greenlit the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids. Since then, adults with mild to moderate hearing loss have been able to buy hearing aids directly from stores or manufacturers online without the help of a doctor.

To access the new hearing aid feature, AirPods Pro 2 users will have to take a test that will analyze their hearing loss by playing a series of tones.

“After you take a hearing test, your AirPods Pro are transformed into a personalized hearing aid, boosting specific sounds you need in real-time, like parts of speech or elements within your environment,” said Desai.

But over-the-counter hearing aids like these aren’t always the solution for hearing loss. The FDA still requires people under 18 years old to purchase hearing aids by prescription. Over-the-counter hearing aids, such as Apple’s offering, also are not a treatment for “severe or profound” hearing loss, according to the FDA. Those with significant hearing loss should still consult a health care professional.

Apple said it expects to receive FDA clearance “very soon,” meaning the AirPods Pro 2 would become a regulated medical device. This fall, the hearing assistance features will become available through a software update in over 100 countries, including the United States, Germany and Japan, the company said.

This isn’t the first time Apple has dabbled in the health care space. Apple’s Watch can detect irregular heart rhythms associated with atrial fibrillation or AFib, which can lead to blood clots, stroke and heart failure, according to the American Heart Association.

On Tuesday, Apple announced that its latest Apple Watch 10 can also alert users to sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing stops and starts repeatedly during sleep.

High hopes for Apple’s new hearing aid feature

Barbara Kelley, the executive director of Hearing Loss Association of America, said she had hoped for an announcement like Apple’s after the FDA opened up the market to over-the-counter offerings two years ago.

“This is what we wanted in the market, to see technology innovation to really get people to pay attention to their hearing health,” Kelley said.

Kelley said she hoped Apple’s new product would encourage more people to address hearing loss.

“There’s still a stigma attached to hearing loss coming with aging,” Kelley said. “But my goodness, I see elementary school kids with these AirPods in their ears. If it can also serve as a hearing aid, I think that’s really exciting.”

Apple’s announcement was applauded by some hearing aid users on social media, as well. But many noted one clear advantage traditional hearing aids have over AirPods: Hearing aids have battery life measured in days, not hours.

“As someone who is hearing impaired, this was the most exciting thing from today’s event,” one Reddit user posted Tuesday. “I am hoping that they can make battery life better than 3-6 hours. It’d be nice to get 8 hours.”"

tech,Mate XT: China’s Huawei unveils its answer to Apple’s iPhone 16,2024-09-09,Juliana Liu,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Huawei has unveiled what it calls the world’s first tri-fold smartphone, just hours after arch-rival Apple introduced the iPhone 16, in a carefully timed Tuesday launch that has generated significant buzz for the Chinese tech giant.

The Shenzhen-based firm, which has been a flashpoint in an escalating tech rivalry between Washington and Beijing, is currently in the midst of a spectacular comeback having launched wildly popular models like the Mate 60 Pro and Mate X5. In August, Huawei reported double digit jumps in both revenue and profit, despite US sanctions.

Successful sales of the Mate XT smartphone, which currently has more than 3.7 million pre-orders since becoming available online Saturday, would be another indication of the company’s sustained resurgence. The base model starts at 19,999 yuan ($2,800).

Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei’s consumer business, said at the livestreamed launch event that the smartphone had taken five years to develop, leading to “breakthroughs” in screen and hinge technology.

“Huawei Mate XT is the world’s first triple-fold smartphone, and the largest and thinnest foldable handset globally,” he said. “We are the first in the world to achieve outward folding (in smartphones) and the first to create an inward-folding phone with no gaps.”

The phone features three panels that can be folded up to three times, Yu said. It has a 10.2-inch screen and is available in red and black.

Tuesday’s product launch came just hours after competitor Apple (AAPL) unveiled a slew of new products, including the iPhone 16, its first smartphone purpose-built for generative artificial intelligence (AI). It’s a feature the company hopes will help convince customers to upgrade.

Amber Liu, research manager at market research firm Canalys, said Huawei’s rapid recovery “directly challenges” Apple’s performance in China, its second-largest market which accounts for over 20% of its global shipments.

It also comes after Chinese smartphone makers dominated the top five spots domestically on a quarterly basis for the first time ever, she said, pushing Apple to sixth place.

“The close timing of Huawei and Apple’s product launches signals the start of a new competitive wave in the Chinese premium market,” Liu told CNN. Key areas of competition will include high-end products, software capabilities and AI deployment, she added.

Apple said that generative AI, like ChatGPT, on its iPhone 16 would allow users to create text and images with natural-language prompts. It’s unclear whether the Mate XT includes any AI features.

Big screen, high price

Jene Park, a senior analyst at the smartphone foldables practice at Counterpoint Research, said the company is clearly focusing on a larger display and extended battery usage time.

“I think this latest attempt could bring about significant changes in the display size of book-type foldables, which currently range from 7 inches to 8 inches,” he added.

Analysts say the success of the launch will depend, in part, on the phone’s pricing and availability. Liu believes actual sales will be lower than the number of pre-orders for those reasons.

Sales of Huawei’s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu said in June, underscoring the company’s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions.

US policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company’s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn’t stop some American allies — such as the UK — limiting Huawei’s role in building 5G networks.

The US ban prevented companies like Google (GOOGL) from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm’s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become “a brick.”

Now, the company is once again making its way back to the top. It’s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla’s Model S. And it has big ambitions in AI.

Nvidia (NVDA) earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the production of processors that power AI systems."
food,Amazon targets Aldi with a new lineup of ‘no-frills’ groceries,2024-09-10,Jordan Valinsky,"New York CNN —

Amazon is taking a page out of Aldi and Target’s playbook and launching a new line of budget-friendly food items in an attempt to attract price-conscious shoppers who are ditching name brands to save money.

Amazon is rolling out a new “no-frills” private label brand called Amazon Saver, with most items priced at less than $5 and that include an array of household staples and pantry items such as cookies and crackers and perishable items like sliced turkey and ham. More than a hundred additional items will be revealed in the coming months.

The company has several private label food brands, including Amazon Fresh, 365 and Happy Belly, but Saver is the company’s lowest priced brand, which “complements the company’s selection of private label brands designed to provide the best value for a range of grocery products,” Amazon said in a statement.

Amazon is also taking aim at its rivals, including Walmart, Target and Aldi, all of which have cheaply priced private label brands that are popular with customers, as retailers look to retain shoppers despite stubbornly high grocery prices.

A few years of high inflation has forced customers to reevaluate their spending habits and made them prioritize value, especially in grocery shopping, since many similar items are sold at different prices depending on the brand.

“Amazon still has big ambitions in grocery, so it needs to jump on this bandwagon as well as sharpen its value for money position,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. “Saver products will help the business to accomplish this as it provides stronger opening price points.”

Saunders told CNN that it’s vital that Saver has “reasonable quality,” because shoppers “do not want cheap products; they want good products with low prices.”

Shoppers have pulled back spending in the past year as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings, previously told CNN.

Amazon also said that starting Tuesday it would add more grocery discounts for Prime members, its $139 yearly membership program. Shoppers at its roughly 50 Amazon Fresh stores and online are getting price cuts on more than 3,000 items.

Typically, Prime members get a 10% discount, but now they can get up to 50% off eight to 15 grocery items that change weekly, including fresh produce and meats. And more than 1,200 rotating grocery items from popular brands will be discounted 25%. Prime members will also get an additional 10% off its new lineup of Saver products."
business,DJT stock: Trump has lost $4 billion in Truth Social wipeout,2024-09-09,Matt Egan,"New York CNN —

Former President Donald Trump’s social media company is in a deep slump that keeps getting worse, wiping out a huge chunk of his net worth.

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) dropped last week to their lowest level since the merger that brought the owner of Truth Social public this spring.

Despite a 7% rebound on Monday, Trump Media has lost nearlythree-quarters (72%) of its value since peaking at $66.22 on March 27.

The selloff has erased significant amounts of wealth for investors — including Trump.

Trump’s dominant stake of 114.75 million shares was valued at $6.2 billion on May 9. It’s now down to about $2.1 billion, a sharp drop that has knocked Trump off the Bloomberg Billionaires Index of the world’s 500 richest people.

The wipeout reinforces concerns raised by experts who have repeatedly warned that Trump Media’s multi-billion-dollar price tag defies logic. The company is losing money, generating very little revenue and Truth Social remains a relatively tiny player in social media.

“If this wasn’t Trump, this thing would be trading at $1,” Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN in a phone interview.

In April, billionaire Barry Diller told CNBC that people who buy Trump Media stock are “dopes.” In June, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman told CNN that Trump Media is valued “absurdly out of the realm of normal.” Both Diller and Hoffman are Democratic megadonors.

Beyond the Trump Media’s weak fundamentals, analysts have said there are likely other factors behind the company’s shrinking share price.

Tuttle argues the fact that Vice President Kamala Harris is neck-and-neck with Trump in some polls is a major catalyst.

Indeed, Trump Media has lost about half of its market value since President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris on July 21.

“This stock is entirely a Trump-gets-elected play,” Tuttle said. “If Trump wins, this could be a viable company. But if he loses, I don’t know how this is a going concern.”

Trump Media did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Of course, Trump Media is still sitting on more than $300 million in cash and equivalents — financial firepower it could use to make acquisitions and fund its operations.

And although Trump Media brought in just $837,000 in revenue last quarter, it is building a streaming business that caters to conservatives. In August, Trump Media launched Truth+, a TV streaming platform on iOS, Android and the Web versions of Truth Social.

Another cloud hovering over Trump Media is the looming expiration of the lock-up period that prevented Trump and other insiders from selling shares.

Those restrictions are set to go away as soon as September 20, according to filings. That will free up insiders to sell shares if they wish to.

However, experts have said it would be very difficult for Trump, the company’s majority shareholder, to sell all or even most of his shares without crashing the stock.

It’s possible Trump Media’s stock market fortunes could turn, especially with the former president’s high-profile debate Tuesday with Harris.

Still, Tuttle cautioned retail investors, even Trump fans, to tread lightly with this stock and pay attention to the fundamentals.

“I am a huge believer that you must keep politics and profits separate,” he said. “If you’re holding onto this for dear life because you’re a Trump fan, that’s just stupid. You invest to make money.”"
business,Peter Nygard: Former Canadian fashion mogul sentenced to 11 years for sexual assault,2024-09-09,Story Ap,"Former Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard was sentenced Monday in a Toronto courtroom to 11 years in prison for sexually assaulting four women. The judge called the 83-year-old a “sexual predator.”

Justice Robert Goldstein said Nygard showed no empathy for his victims, who were all attacked at his company’s offices. The judge said one of several aggravating factors in the case was the fact that one of the victims was just 16 years old at the time.

Nygard was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault in November but acquitted of a fifth count as well as one count of forcible confinement. He faces separate sexual assault and sex trafficking charges in Montreal, Winnipeg and the United States.

Nygard has denied all allegations against him.

Nygard, who once led a women’s fashion empire, arrived at the courthouse in a wheelchair, and did not address the court when given the opportunity. His time behind bars will come to a little less than seven years after accounting for time served. He will be eligible to apply for parole in two years.

The charges against Nygard stemmed from allegations dating back to the 1980s until the mid-2000s.

During his trial, five women, whose identities are protected by a publication ban, testified they were invited to Nygard’s Toronto business headquarters under pretexts ranging from tours to job interviews. All the encounters ended in a top-floor bedroom suite where four of the women were sexually assaulted.

Multiple women told the jury similar stories of meeting Nygard on a plane, at an airport tarmac or at a nightclub and then receiving invitations to come to his headquarters. All five women said their meetings or interactions with Nygard ended with sexual activity that they did not consent to.

Nygard’s lawyer had argued for a six-year sentence, citing her client’s age and poor health, while the Crown sought a sentence of 15 years.

The judge dismissed the argument for a shorter sentence, saying Nygard has been receiving special treatment in custody due to his various health issues and that his advanced age is not reason enough to limit the sentence.

Goldstein also suggested Nygard had been exaggerating his health issues in his submissions to the court.

Nygard’s lawyer previously argued in court that a lengthy sentence would be “crushing” for her client, who has Type 2 diabetes and deteriorating vision, among other health issues.

Goldstein called Nygard “a Canadian success story gone very wrong.”

Nygard founded a fashion company in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1967 that ultimately became Nygard International. His company produced women’s clothing under several brand names and had corporate facilities in Canada and the U.S. His stores throughout Winnipeg were once draped with his photos.

Nygard stepped down as chairman of the company after the FBI and police raided his offices in New York City in February 2020. The company has since filed for bankruptcy and entered into receivership.

He was first arrested in Winnipeg in 2020 under the Extradition Act after he was charged with nine counts in New York, including sex trafficking and racketeering charges.

In May, Manitoba’s highest court dismissed Nygard’s application for a judicial review of his extradition order, finding there was no reason to interfere with the order issued by then-justice minister David Lametti."
investing,Dow gets a 500-point boost,2024-09-09,David Goldman,"Investors got some much-needed R&R over the weekend, apparently, because they came back to work Monday with smiles on their faces and a brighter outlook about the US economy.

The Dow rose 484 points, or 1.2%, on Monday. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.2% and tech-heavy Nasdaq was also 1.2% higher. At one point earlier in the afternoon, the Dow was up more than 600 points.

That’s in stark contrast to the mood from last week, when investors punished stocks in the lead-up to what Wall Street predicted would be a less-than-thrilling jobs report. On Friday, investors got what they expected: a fine, but not great look at the labor market that showed America’s job market is growing but not at the electric pace of past years.

Fear took hold on Wall Street last week, and though that remained the predominant sentiment Monday, CNN Business’ Fear and Greed Index ticked higher, near “neutral” sentiment.

This week, investors will get another look at US inflation data, starting Wednesday morning with the Consumer Price Index report. That’s expected to show that inflation slowed dramatically in August — another sign that the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is paying off.

The Fed has kept interest rates high to bring price hikes under control. But there’s an (intended) consequence to rate hikes: They slow the economy down. Rate hikes increase the costs of doing business and hurt profitability. That tends to slow down hiring, which means fewer jobs and less money for consumers to spend. Because consumer spending makes up the vast majority of America’s economy, the Fed almost always plunges the economy into a recession when it hikes rates — although that’s obviously not the goal.

The fact that America is not in a recession after years of high rates is nothing short of extraordinary. Until recently, hiring kept on booming and consumers kept on spending — largely because pandemic-era stimulus hadn’t quite worn off yet and because many homeowners locked in ultra-low mortgage rates that freed up cash.

That may be part of what investors are reacting to Monday: Yes, the job market is showing signs of stress, but the recent selloff could be overdone.

The fact that the economy is still gaining jobs at a healthy clip is exactly the “soft landing” scenario many were hoping for (and doubting could be achieved) when the Fed started jacking up rates a couple years ago.

It’s too early to declare victory, but it sure looks like this is a best-case scenario, considering where we were a couple years back."
tech,"Apple iPhone 16, AirPods 4 and the Apple Watch 10: Everything you missed",2024-09-09,"Clare Duffy, Samantha Murphy Kelly, Samantha Delouya","Apple on Monday unveiled a host of new technology, including the iPhone 16, which features some impressive updates the company hopes will convince customers – many of whom have been holding onto their older gadgets – to upgrade.

Since the 2020 launch of the iPhone 12, which was the first Apple smartphone with 5G connectivity, the company has given customers few reasons to buy the latest generation. Phone cameras have largely advanced to the point where they’re sufficient for most people’s day-to-day needs without major hardware changes, and at some point the human eye isn’t even capable of perceiving higher screen resolutions.

That’s why roughly 300 million iPhones worldwide have not been upgraded in more than four years, according to a research note from analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush last month. As a result, iPhone sales, which make up half of the company’s revenue, have been sluggish.

Similarly, the Apple Watch and AirPods have seen mostly incremental upgrades in recent years that haven’t persuaded customers to shell out hundreds of dollars for slightly better devices.

On Monday, Apple made several announcements it believes could promote a new major sales cycle.

Apple announced that the iPhone 16 would be the first model purpose-built for generative artificial intelligence, which would allow users to create text and images with a natural-language prompt. Both the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro will be available for pre-order on Friday and in stores on September 20, Apple announced.

Camera control button: A new camera control feature, accessed with a button on the side of the phone, which will give users access to “visual intelligence,” Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering, said on Monday. For example, after clicking the camera control, a user can point the camera at a restaurant and the iPhone 16 will pull up information like reviews, the menu and how to make a reservation. It can also be used to identify things like dog breeds or landmarks and to add things to your calendar.

Siri enhancements: Siri will now be able to pull from users’ text messages, meaning it can remind you of TV and music recommendations sent by friends, said Federighi. For example, you can say, “Send Erica the photos from Saturday’s barbecue,” and Siri will understand which photos to send and automatically text them to the right person.

New colors: The new phones come in white, black, teal, “ultramarine” and pink. They’re also available in two sizes: 6.1 inches for the iPhone 16 and 6.7 inches for iPhone 16 Plus. The 16 line also comes packed with buttons, including the customizable Action Button from the previous generation. It also adds a new camera control slider, which is a small flush area on the side of the phone that works by capacitative touch, just like the phone’s screen responds to a finger. Users can slide a finger along it to access and use different camera features, like the depth of field.

Faster processor: The iPhone 16 comes with 17% more system memory bandwidth to better support Apple Intelligence, a glass-ceramic screen that promises to be 50% tougher and 40% faster GPU than the previous model.

Same price: The new iPhone 16 will start at $799, the company said. The iPhone 16 Plus will start at $899.

IPhone 16 Pro

The new iPhone 16 Pro. From Apple

The iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s higher-end iPhone, features even more AI features than the iPhone 16.

Bigger screens: The iPhone 16 Pro line is bigger by 0.2 inches than last year’s models: the entry-level Pro is 6.3 inches and the Pro Max is 6.9 inches, allowing users to see and do more on the display. Apple said the devices include the thinnest borders yet.

Better battery, new colors: The iPhone 16 Pro also features the longest-lasting battery life on any of its iPhones, and comes in four colors: white titanium, darker titanium, natural titanium and a brown-colored desert titanium.

4K video: The new high-end iPhone 16 also lets you shoot in 4K resolution at 120 frames per second, with the ability to make the video slow-motion after recording a clip, rather than trying to grab the right setting as the action is happening. The Pro line is also getting an audio recording boost, including spatial audio with reduced background noise, enabling videos to pick conversations from the people centered in the video out from the ambient noise around them.

Price: The new Apple iPhone 16 Pro will cost $999 and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will be $1,199, the company announced Monday.

AirPods

Apple's AirPods 4. From Apple

Apple unveiled the latest version of its AirPods line that the company calls its “most comfortable” set yet. And its AirPods Pro gained a hearing aid feature that is awaiting regulatory approval.

New shape: Apple said the AirPods 4 were redesigned with advanced modeling tools to make the earbuds fit better into user ears.

New features: The AirPods 4 also come with more control to play and pause music, start and end calls, and now include USB-C via the charging case. They also come with a handful of features that are typically found on its higher-end Pro model, including active noise cancellation and “transparency mode,” which enables users to hear the outside ambient environment.

Two prices: The new AirPods 4 will cost $129 and AirPods 4 with the active noise cancellation feature will be slightly more expensive at $179, the company announced on Monday.

Hearing aid feature: Apple’s new AirPods Pro model will come with a clinical-grade over-the-counter hearing aid feature, the company said, as well as a clinical hearing test that users can access on their iPhones. Apple said it expects to receive clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulators soon, but the feature will be available in over 100 countries and regions, including the US, this month.

Apple Watch

Apple Watch Series 10. From Apple

The new Apple Watch 10 is the thinnest smartwatch Apple has made yet – and it has the Apple Watch’s largest-ever screen display – 30% larger than previous Apple Watches.

New look: The watch comes in a new polished titanium finish in jet black, along with rose gold and silver.

Tracks sleep apnea: Apple’s latest watch can detect sleep apnea, the company said Monday. The common and potentially dangerous condition can cause breathing to stop while people are sleeping. The detection feature is awaiting clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration, Apple said, and is expected to be available in over 150 countries and regions later this month.

Faster charging: Apple says the new Apple Watch also charges quickly — up to 80% in 30 minutes, and it has a battery life of up to 18 hours.

New features: The latest device, which can now go 20 feet underwater, features a water temperature sensor and a depth gauge. It also has specs specifically designed for snorkeling, such as direction and time spent underwater.

Price and availability: Apple’s new Series 10 watch will start at $399, according to the company. It is now available to pre-order and will be available on September 20."
business,US employers have good reasons not to hire more workers now,2024-09-08,"Bryan Mena, Elisabeth Buchwald","It couldn’t be clearer at this point that the US labor market is cooling.

Even though the unemployment rate edged lower last month to 4.2%, joblessness is still hovering near highs not seen since the fall of 2021. On top of that, employers have hired significantly fewer workers in recent months compared to prior years and the number of job openings fell in July to the lowest level since January 2021, according to Labor Department data.

But America’s job market may have some pent-up momentum just waiting to be unleashed. That’s because employers might be putting some of their hiring plans on hold — and for good reason.

Businesses consider many factors when deciding to hire, but across a wide spectrum of industries, the economic outlook carries always great deal of weight. And it makes sense: Why take on more workers if, for instance, there’s a strong chance a recession is around the corner that then forces layoffs?

Currently, there’s no shortage of economic uncertainty — the bulk of which stems from the US presidential election taking place in two months as well as upcoming key decisions on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Both those factors are prompting employers to think twice about hiring more workers now, according to economists and recent comments from businesses around the country.

Still, while both are “contributing to businesses’ cautious hiring sentiment at the moment,” many hiring decisions are likely being shaped even more by “slower demand for their goods and services both domestically and abroad,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CNN.

“Consumer spending has been the dominant engine of economic growth. As it slows, so does overall activity and this will all pinch corporate top and bottom lines,” she said.

The big election question mark

Even the Fed’s Beige Book, a collection of survey responses from businesses complied by the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, said that “with uncertainty pertaining to the presidential election ahead, many firms have put hiring plans on hold.”

That shouldn’t be all too shocking given the stark differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

Trump, for instance, has cast himself as an America first candidate. He’s calling for a 60% tariff on imports from China and at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports from other nations. However, companies that make products domestically would pay a 15% corporate tax rate versus the current 21%, Trump unveiled in a speech he gave at the Economic Club of New York last week.

Harris, meanwhile, has been silent on what she would do with regard to tariffs. But she’s proposing raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. At the same time, she announced a plan that aims to make it easier for new small businesses to form with hefty tax deductions.

If elected, Trump may be able to get tariffs passed without congressional approval, as he’s previously done, but the tax code changes he and Harris are proposing would require Congress to sign off. And which party controls the House and the Senate will also be decided on in this election. Depending on the results, it could limit Trump or Harris’ ability to make good on vastly different campaign promises.

Holding off on hiring more workers until after the election is “a rational decision,” said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Forecasting at the University of Central Florida.

“When there’s more clarity about the future,” he said, “businesses are more confident in making these kinds of decisions.”

Waiting on lower interest rates

It’s widely expected that the Fed will finally begin to slash interest rates later this month and will cut perhaps a few more times by year’s end, so it may just be a matter of waiting on that to happen before firms start hiring at faster clip, Julia Pollak, ZipRecruiter’s chief economist, told CNN.

That’s because businesses of all sizes, but especially smaller ones, rely heavily on credit. From getting a business off the ground to expanding operations, borrowing is key in the business world. So when interest rates are as elevated as they are right now, monthly debt payments could be too costly for many firms. And if rates are expected to come down over the next year, why take out a loan right now?

“Many companies are saying they have lots of growth opportunities, they want to open a new location, get a new warehouse, get a new truck, but they can’t do any of that stuff right now because interest rates are too high, so it doesn’t pencil out. The investment would be too costly,” Pollak said. “It’s just a temporary holding pattern.”

Although Fed officials have opened the door for rate cuts, it’s not clear how aggressive the Fed will be. The first rate cut this month is expected to be just a quarter point, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That expectation has already helped send the 10-year US Treasury yield lower. Many loans track that benchmark, as well.

But businesses may wait for more relief, which will depend on inflation and unemployment. Whenever rates do come down enough, and if American shoppers continue to spend at a healthy pace, hiring could accelerate, Pollak said."
business,Many pickup trucks must be redesigned to reduce pedestrian deaths under proposed regulation,2024-09-09,Associated Press,"The U.S. government’s road safety agency wants the auto industry to design new vehicles including increasingly large SUVs and pickup trucks so they reduce pedestrian deaths and injuries.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday that it’s proposing a new rule setting testing and performance requirements to minimize the risk of pedestrian head injuries.

The rule is aimed largely at SUVs and pickup trucks, which have grown in size and hood height over the years, causing blind spots for drivers.

NHTSA said pedestrian deaths increased 57% from 2013 to 2022, from 4,779 to 7,522. The agency says the rule would save 67 lives per year.

Data show that pedestrian deaths when hit by the front of a vehicle are most common for SUVs and trucks.

The proposed rule, required by Congress in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, would set test procedures to simulate head-to-hood impact as well as requirements to reduce the risk of head injuries. Human-like head dummies that simulate children and adults would be used in testing, NHTSA said in a prepared statement.

“We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians,” NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said in the statement. “This proposed rule will ensure that vehicles will be designed to protect those inside and outside from serious injury or death.”

Messages were left Monday seeking comment from automakers and the industry’s main trade association."
business,DirecTV is now paying customers to subscribe to competitors as Disney battle escalates,2024-09-09,Jordan Valinsky,"New York CNN —

DirecTV wants its customers to stick with the service during an increasingly nasty dispute with Disney that threatens to black out tonight’s “Monday Night Football” game. So DirecTV developed an unusual strategy: It’s paying customers to subscribe to a rival.

DirecTV has struck deals with Sling, owned by rival satellite provider Dish Network, and Fubo to offer its customers credits and discounts to sign up for competing streaming services so people can watch the game, which is airing on ABC and ESPN, two networks blacked out on its own service.

Affected customers of DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-Verse can get a free weeklong trial of Fubo for two of its packages that carry ESPN and Disney networks and an additional $30 off the first month of service. DirecTV is also giving its customers a $30 credit to sign up for Sling’s orange tier that includes ESPN channels.

DirecTV said the deals are a “small way” to help customers while its fight over the expired distribution agreement with Disney stretches into a second week. DirecTV is still offering a credit to customers but has increased it from $20 to $30.

On Sunday, DirecTV filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission alleging Disney did not negotiate in good faith and signaling the two sides aren’t close in reaching a deal.

In the 10-page complaint, DirecTV claimed the negotiations stalled because, “Disney insists on bundling and penetration requirements that a federal district court judge in New York recently found in the context of the ‘Venu’ joint venture to be unlawful, anticompetitive, and ‘bad for consumers.’”

Last month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, a joint sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery after Fubo filed a lawsuit against the media giants. (Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.)

More than 11 million subscribers have been affected by Disney pulling its ABC stations, ESPN and other networks from DirecTV’s lineup last week. The blackout also comes ahead of the upcoming presidential debate on ABC between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, as well as the start of the NFL and college football seasons.

“We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible,” a Disney spokesperson told CNN. “We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of ‘Monday Night Football.’”

Still, the blackout hasn’t stopped DirecTV’s plans to hike prices of DirecTV Stream and traditional satellite services. Beginning in October, monthly fees will increase between $2 to $10 depending on the tier and service a customer has.

business,Big Lots files for bankruptcy,2024-09-09,Jordan Valinsky,"New York CNN —

Big Lots, the beleaguered discount retailer that previously warned it had “substantial doubt” about its survival, has filed for bankruptcy.

As part of its Chapter 11 filing, the retailer announced that private equity firm Nexus Capital Management is acquiring “substantially all” of Big Lots stores and business operations. During the process, its locations and website will remain open for shopping.

“The actions we are taking today will enable us to move forward with new owners who believe in our business and provide financial stability, while we optimize our operational footprint, accelerate improvement in our performance, and deliver on our promise to be the leader in extreme value,” said Big Lots CEO Bruce Thorn in a press release.

Big Lots blamed several economic factors for its bankruptcy, including high inflation and interest rates. That has led customers to change their purchasing behavior. They’re seeking out value – but not necessarily lower costs. That’s why dollar stores have been struggling while sales at Walmart and Amazon have been booming. It’s also why McDonald’s has been struggling while casual chains like Applebee’s have been growing.

“The prevailing economic trends have been particularly challenging to Big Lots, as its core customers curbed their discretionary spending on the home and seasonal product categories that represent a significant portion of the company’s revenue,” it explained.

More store closures could be coming, too. Big Lots is in the process of closing roughly 300 of its 1,400 store across the United States. No additional closures were announced Monday, but Big Lots warned it will “need to close certain locations to ensure that our business operates efficiently and we can continue serving our customers.”

The 57-year-old company has secured $707.5 million in fresh financing to keep operating and to pay employees and vendors. Nexus was named the “stalking horse bidder” with its acquisition expected to close later this year, unless there are better offers.

But it’s “unlikely that another bidder will emerge” because of the short sales timeline, according to Sarah Foss, global head of legal and restructuring for Debtwire, a publication focused on leverage markets.

Chapter 11 is useful for Big Lots because “it gives a debtor leverage in negotiations and allows a company to renegotiate and reject burdensome leases and contracts, which are often a major financial strain on a distressed company in this sector,” Foss told CNN.

Big Lots joins a growing list of well-known retailers hitting financial turbulence as customers cut back spending on non-essential items. Last week, LL Flooring announced that it couldn’t find a buyer and is shutting down after more than three decades in business."
media,The Washington Post is trying to fix one of the biggest problems,2024-09-09,Brian Stelter,"New York CNN —

The Washington Post is trying to fix one of its biggest problems: an outdated homepage loathed by its own staff.

The facelift is a key facet of Post publisher and chief executive Will Lewis’s plan to turn around the publication’s fortunes on behalf of owner Jeff Bezos This year the Post is forecast to lose about $50 million, an improvement over last year’s $77 million loss, but still an unsatisfactory result.

Lewis is under pressure to recapture paying subscribers and return the Post to profitability, a goal he says he is making progress on. In his weekly memo to Post staffers on Friday evening, Lewis called the updated homepage an “important step forward.”

Reporters and editors at the news organization have long grumbled about the drab and dated nature of the Post’s digital front door. Among the frustrations: The homepage featured relatively few stories at any given time and lacked a sense of cohesion. Staffers envied the homepages of rivals like The New York Times. Lewis acknowledged as much in his memo.

“Many of you have expressed your dislike of the previous version,” he wrote. “I agreed and encouraged you to improve it and you did just that.”

The new iteration, which launched last week, “is the beginning of several planned enhancements,” newly installed executive editor Matt Murray wrote to the newsroom.

The new homepage has double the amount of space for top stories — six slots instead of three — a muchwelcomed change.

“Section editors had been fighting to get their stories into those three featured slots, leading to a lot of frustration,” a Post reporter explained.

As part of the redesign, Opinion pieces have also been moved higher up on the page, while some sections like “Help Desk” and “Technology” have been dropped. Staffers said they expect further upgrades in the coming months.

Lots of people find Post journalism through side doors, like social media accounts and email newsletters, but the front door has become more important as social networks shut off the traffic firehose and Google integrates A.I. into its search results. More urgently, at the Post, the homepage redesign is a sign that the new management regime is moving quickly to make significant changes.

Earlier this summer, the paper also launched a new marketing campaign playing off its “Democracy Dies in Darkness” slogan with the catchphrase “Switch On,” in a bid to supercharge growth at the newspaper.

Lewis was appointed publisher and chief executive in January and didn’t mince words about the beleaguered state of the Post. His turnaround strategy was welcomed by many staffers, but morale plummeted in the spring when allegations resurfaced about his involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup. (He has denied wrongdoing.)

While Lewis hasn’t entirely recovered, he has used his weekly memos to tout progress in rebuilding the Post’s subscriber rolls. On Friday, Lewis said “last week was our highest net growth week of the year for subscriptions and this ongoing growth is due to great teamwork across the company.”

A Post spokeswoman declined to specify the newspaper’s current number of digital subscribers. The most recent publicized total was 2.7 million."
business,Britain’s local governments at risk of ‘financial collapse’,2024-09-09,Hanna Ziady,"London CNN —

Local governments across England, Scotland and Wales face a £4.3 billion ($5.6 billion) hole in their finances in the coming year, according to a new report. That could force cuts to jobs and vital services, such as rubbish collection.

In a paper Monday, Unison, the United Kingdom’s largest trade union, warned that, without additional emergency funding to plug the projected shortfall in the 2025-26 financial year, “there is a serious risk of the widespread collapse of local government.”

The funding gap facing local councils is projected to balloon to £8.5 billion ($11.1 billion) the following year, according to the report, which is based on publicly available financial statements and some councils’ own estimates of their funding shortfalls provided to Unison.

The report comes as the UK’s recently elected Labour government prepares to unveil plans for local government funding in its first budget next month, after revealing a £22 billion ($29 billion) “black hole” in the nation’s finances in July.

Unison said many local government authorities could be forced to sell land and buildings, as well as cut back on services, such as rubbish collection, libraries and public toilets to fulfil a legal duty to balance their books.

In a speech last month, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that the budget “is going to be painful,” hinting at tax rises. “We’re going to have to take tough decisions,” he said.

Many of Britain’s local governments have faced chronic funding shortfalls over the past decade, partly as a result of deep cuts to funds from the central government in the 2010s.

After accounting for inflation, English councils have lost 9% in “core funding” — made up of funds from the central government and local taxes — between 2010 and this year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That amounts to a cut of 18% per resident as populations have grown.

Birmingham, the biggest British city after London, effectively declared itself bankrupt a year ago, halting all spending except on essential services.

In March, the city’s council approved “one of the biggest local government cuts packages in history,” according to Unison, “including plans to scrap up to 600 jobs, slash social care and children’s services funding, and reduce waste collections.”

Unison noted that since 2018, eight councils have issued so-called section 114 notices, meaning they are effectively bankrupt.

“Councils are teetering on the brink of financial disaster,” Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said in a statement. “Countless essential services and very many vital jobs are at risk, with terrible consequences for communities across Britain… After 14 years of ruthless austerity, the very fabric of local society is under threat.”

Between 2010 and 2023, councils closed some 1,243 youth centers and 1,168 children’s centers — community centers that provide free classes and services to young people and families. The number of public toilets dropped by 1,629 over the same period, and the number of council-run libraries fell by 1,376, according to Unison.

Giving examples of further cuts to come, Unison said Shropshire Council in the West Midlands region of England plans to slashup to 540 jobs.

Derbyshire County Council in the East Midlands has proposed closing up to 11 elderly care homes, while Hampshire County Council in the southeast of England has proposed withdrawing all spending on support for the homeless from March next year, Unison added.

In a statement Monday, a UK government spokesperson said the government would “fix the foundations of local government.”

“We will get councils back on their feet by getting the basics right — providing more stability through multi-year funding settlements, ending competitive bidding for pots of money and reforming the local audit system,” the spokesperson added.

IFS associate director David Phillips, who leads research on local government finance at the institute, cautioned that the way councils calculate future funding requirements and hence gaps was “opaque” and likely to differ across authorities."
business,Being a police officer is one of America’s hottest jobs right now,2024-09-09,Bryan Mena,"Washington CNN —

Americans may be finding it a little tougher to land a job these days, but not so much in one field in which salaries are climbing fast and employers are offering robust perks.

Once a source of US economic resilience, the nation’s job market is now weaker than it has been in recent years, and it’s still unclear if it will soften further. In July, the labor market had the fewest available jobs since January 2021, according to government figures released Wednesday. Job growth has also slowed over the past several months, with employers adding fewer jobs than expected in August after logging a tepid 89,000 job gain in July, the Labor Department said Friday in a separate report.

But a few industries are defying the slowdown. The health care industry is still the leading job creator, though law enforcement is also seeing some momentum. Police departments and sheriff’s offices across are clamoring for new recruits after grappling with a sharp drop in applicants and a wave of retirements after George Floyd’s murder in 2020 caused many to be wary of working for a police force, recruiters told CNN.

US job openings have fallen substantially across the board since they reached a record high in March 2022 — down about 37% through July. But in state and local government, excluding education, openings have declined by just 7.6% during the same period, government data show. A sizable chunk of those openings are in law enforcement.

The average salary of a police officer climbed more than 37% in the first eight months of this year compared to the same time last year, according to ZipRecruiter data provided to CNN. That’s a recent sign of strong demand for police officers, because from 2022 to 2023 the average salary for policing jobs rose by roughly 8%.

“Police departments are trying hard to make the role more attractive after suffering a recruitment and retention crisis,” said ZipRecruiter Chief Economist Julia Pollak. She added that there’s also been a huge spike in job postings on ZipRecruiter listing “law enforcement” as a desired skill.

While a police officer may be a steady job, it’s important to note that it usually requires a months-long training process (typically paid), as well as an extensive background check.

Solid benefits and job security

The police department in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa dealt with the same hiring challenges in 2020 as other departments across the country. But it turned that situation around by increasing pay and making the application process much smoother, Mesa Police assistant chief Ed Wessing told CNN.

The Mesa Police Department also advertises another enticing incentive: After working as a municipal employee for 20 years, the city provides workers medical insurance benefits for life. That perk was discontinued in 2009 when Mesa was forced to make some budget cuts but it was brought it back in 2023 “to recruit and retain talented employees who want to build a career in the public sector,” the city said in a release.

“When our recruiters are talking with prospective applicants, that’s one of the things that we highlight right away,” Wessing said. “That’s really drawn a lot more people back into looking at Mesa versus going to the departments at neighboring Gilbert, Scottsdale, Chandler, Tempe and Phoenix. That’s been a huge benefit that the city did, which has helped us in our recruiting efforts.”

He added that whenever the broader economy hits a rough patch, “folks start to look to government positions that offer job security, like a police officer.”

A hot job for veterans, plus sign-on bonuses

The pipeline of going from the military to a police force has become more common.

Data provided to CNN from Hire Heroes USA, a nonprofit job placement agency for veterans and their spouses, show that jobs in “safety, security and law enforcement” have been one of the top categories for clients in recent years. Johnathan Severs, director of client programs at the firm, said “from the ground level, there’s absolutely been an increase” in hiring for law enforcement roles among clients this year.

And there’s another sign of strong demand: sign-on bonuses.

After serving 25 years in the US Army as a petroleum supply specialist, Ramonedward Bayer, 44, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, decided this was the year he would retire. That meant hitting job search market by writing up a resume and attending job fairs, only Bayer wasn’t exactly sure what kind of job he wanted. He said a Seattle Police Department recruiter had piqued his interest. Bayer started the police officer application process with some reservations but eventually became convinced he was doing the right thing.

“I wasn’t even interested in the police. It wasn’t really on my radar,” Bayer said. “I’m a person of Filipino background, and I remembered when I went to a Filipino community event, I saw how the officers were interacting with the people within the community, and how the community wanted them there. It just really motivated me to to continue with the process and finish it.”

Bayer said he was offered a $7,500 sign-on bonus and financial assistance to relocate to Seattle.

Pollak of ZipRecruiter said workers don’t usually pivot to law enforcement from a completely unrelated career. But that could change if the job market keeps sliding.

“We’re creatures of habit, so we tend to stay put and not push ourselves out of our comfort zones, unless we have to. And with hiring slowing in so many industries right now, that is prompting people to explore other kinds of opportunities, opportunities that provide paid training,” she said."

business,Advertisers plan to withdraw from X in record numbers,2024-09-05,Hanna Ziady,"London CNN —

A record number of firms plan to cut advertising spending on X next year because of concerns that extreme content on the platform could damage their brands, dealing another blow to the financial fortunes of Elon Musk’s social media company.

A global survey by market research firm Kantar found that a net 26% of marketers plan to decrease their spending on X in 2025, the biggest recorded pullback from any major global ad platform. Only 4% of marketers overall think X ads provide “brand safety” — certainty that their ads won’t appear alongside extreme content — compared with 39% for Google ads, Kantar said in a report Thursday.

“Advertisers have been moving their marketing spend away from X for several years,” Gonca Bubani, Kantar’s global thought leadership director for media, said in a statement, adding that “a turnaround currently seems unlikely.”

“X has changed so much in recent years and can be unpredictable from one day to the next — it’s difficult to feel confident about your brand safety in that environment.”

Consumers, on the other hand, feel more positive about ads on X because there are fewer than there used to be, according to Kantar.

The findings suggest that Musk’s charm offensive at the world’s largest annual advertising festival, Cannes Lions, in June hasn’t succeeded. During an interview with Mark Read, the CEO of the marketing giant WPP, the billionaire struck a conciliatory tone after telling advertisers last year to “go f**k yourself.”

He agreed that advertisers “have a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands.”

But his attempts to woo advertisers appear short-lived. Last month, Musk filed a lawsuit against an influential ad industry body — whose members include Unilever, Mars, and CVS — claiming the group conspired to “boycott” X.

In a statement Thursday, an X spokesperson said the platform “now offers stronger brand safety, performance and analytics capabilities than ever before, while seeing all-time-high levels of usage.”

The spokesperson added that X’s “brand safety rate is on average 99%, as validated by DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science,” companies that analyze the value of digital advertising placements.

Since Musk’s $44 billion takeover in 2022, big brands have retreated from the platform, formerly known as Twitter, over concerns about content moderation and uncertainty over the platform’s direction.

Musk’s own comments on Xhave also spooked advertisers. Last November, about a dozen prominent brands — including IBM, Disney, and Paramount — halted ad spending on X over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech, not helped by the fact that Musk himself had endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory. He later apologized.

The Kantar report, which was based on interviews with 1,000 senior marketers and 18,000 consumers in more than two dozen countries, alsofound that X scored outside the top 10 brands for trust and for the perception of how innovative advertising on the platform is.

According to the report, YouTube remains the ad platform marketers most prefer, while, for consumers, Amazon and TikTok share the top spot.

Separately, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said earlier this week that the world isn’t obliged to put up with Musk’s “far-right anything goes” agenda because of his immense wealth.

Brazil blocked X over the weekend following an order by the Supreme Court because Musk refused to appoint a new legal representative in the country. The move escalated a months-long feud over what constitutes free speech, as Brazil cracks down on the spread of misinformation online."
business,Advertisers plan to withdraw from X in record numbers,2024-09-05,Hanna Ziady,"London CNN —

A record number of firms plan to cut advertising spending on X next year because of concerns that extreme content on the platform could damage their brands, dealing another blow to the financial fortunes of Elon Musk’s social media company.

A global survey by market research firm Kantar found that a net 26% of marketers plan to decrease their spending on X in 2025, the biggest recorded pullback from any major global ad platform. Only 4% of marketers overall think X ads provide “brand safety” — certainty that their ads won’t appear alongside extreme content — compared with 39% for Google ads, Kantar said in a report Thursday.

“Advertisers have been moving their marketing spend away from X for several years,” Gonca Bubani, Kantar’s global thought leadership director for media, said in a statement, adding that “a turnaround currently seems unlikely.”

“X has changed so much in recent years and can be unpredictable from one day to the next — it’s difficult to feel confident about your brand safety in that environment.”

Consumers, on the other hand, feel more positive about ads on X because there are fewer than there used to be, according to Kantar.

The findings suggest that Musk’s charm offensive at the world’s largest annual advertising festival, Cannes Lions, in June hasn’t succeeded. During an interview with Mark Read, the CEO of the marketing giant WPP, the billionaire struck a conciliatory tone after telling advertisers last year to “go f**k yourself.”

He agreed that advertisers “have a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands.”

But his attempts to woo advertisers appear short-lived. Last month, Musk filed a lawsuit against an influential ad industry body — whose members include Unilever, Mars, and CVS — claiming the group conspired to “boycott” X.

tech,Nvidia is suddenly in trouble,2024-09-04,David Goldman,"Nvidia, the AI chipmaking titan that was briefly the world’s most valuable company, has suddenly found itself in an unfamiliar position: a major rut.

Nvidia (NVDA) had the worst day in the history of the stock market Tuesday, as measured by loss in total market value. Its 9.5% share price decline shaved a stunning $279 billion off the company’s value, far outpacing the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta in 2022.

To put that shocking decline into context, only 27 companies on the planet are worth as much as Nvidia lost in value Tuesday. That $279 billion evaporation is worth more than all the shares of some of America’s biggest companies, including McDonald’s, Chevron and Pepsi.

CEO Jensen Huang, who is Nvidia’s largest individual shareholder (and fifth-largest overall, counting institutional investors like BlackRock) personally lost $10 billion in wealth Tuesday from Nvidia’s sharp tumble.

The company has been in decline since June 18, when it topped $3.3 trillion in value — the highest for any public company. As the US economy begins to show some signs of stress, investors have grown skeptical of Nvidia and other AI stocks’ sky-high valuations. Stock traders are worried that potential weakness in the economy could make companies think twice before investing in the promising but still risky and unproven technology.

Despite blockbuster earnings last week, Nvidia’s somewhat more tepid outlook disappointed investors who were looking for more upside, and the stock fell.

Nvidia has tumbled more than 20% since its June 18 peak. Microsoft, which has made huge bets on AI technology, has fallen 12% from its most recent peak. And TSMC, Nvidia’s chip manufacturer, has plunged 18% since mid-July.

Meanwhile, Intel, once the world biggest chipmaker, has endured a 59% decline in its share price this year. That company faces its own unique challenges in its bid to remake itself and get into the AI game.

Potential legal problems

But Nvidia may face a different set of problems: The government is reportedly investigating it over potential antitrust violations.

Much of Tuesday’s sharp decline was because the US Justice Department reportedly sent it a subpoena as part of an antitrust probe, according to Bloomberg. CNN could not independently verify the subpoena, and the Department of Justice declined to comment directly on a potential antitrust investigation.

Nvidia on Wednesday afternoon said it has not received a subpoena from the Justice Department.

“We have inquired with the US Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”

The Biden administration has been going hard after tech titans, launching probes and lobbing charges against Apple, Google and Amazon, among others. It’s unclear whether a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump administration would continue those cases, but both have criticized tech companies for various reasons during their campaigns.

Nvidia lost another 1.7% Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite, which tanked more than 3% Tuesday, fell 0.3% Wednesday.

Still, AI bulls continue to believe in Nvidia. The stock remains up 118% this year and has a $2.7 trillion market valuation — a close third behind Apple and Microsoft. Huang said last week that demand for its latest “Blackwell” AI chips “far exceeds its supply.” And even as competition grows, demand for Nvidia’s chips is growing, too.

And the investments are paying off — so far, at least — Huang claims.

“People who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,” Huang said last week, noting that the company’s new graphics processing units, the GPU chips that power AI, process data so efficiently that they end up saving clients money quickly.

That’s why bulls like Wedbush’s Dan Ives believe Nvidia’s stock decline presents a buying opportunity.

“Nvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its GPUs have become the new oil and gold in the IT landscape,” Ives said Tuesday in a note to investors.

tech,Verizon to acquire Frontier in $20 billion deal to boost fiber network,2024-09-05,Unknown,"Verizon said on Thursday it would buy Frontier Communications in an all-cash deal valued at $20 billion, as the U.S. wireless carrier looks to boost its fiber network.

Shares of Frontier Communications fell more than 9% in premarket trading. Verizon climbed about 1%.

Verizon has offered $38.50 per Frontier share held, a premium of 37.3% to Frontier’s closing price on Sept. 3, before reports of a potential acquisition emerged.

The acquisition, which is expected to close in about 18 months, will help Verizon better compete against AT&T and others by enabling it to deliver premium broadband services to existing as well as new customers.

Frontier has 2.2 million fiber subscribers across 25 states, which will combine with Verizon’s about 7.4 million Fios connections in nine states and Washington, D.C.

Verizon’s fiber network is largely in the North East and mid-Atlantic regions, while Frontier’s coverage spans multiple states in the Mid West, Texas, California and others.

“The acquisition of Frontier is a strategic fit. It will build on Verizon’s two decades of leadership … and is an opportunity to become more competitive in more markets throughout the United States,” Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said in a statement.

The deal is projected to generate at least $500 million in annual run-rate cost synergies, and will add to Verizon’s revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization growth upon closing."
business,Beleaguered Burberry is no longer one of UK’s most valuable public companies,2024-09-05,Olesya Dmitracova,"London CNN —

Luxury brand Burberry is dropping out of Britain’s main stock index after suffering a steep fall in value following a plunge in sales and profits.

The 168-year-old brand will leave the FTSE 100, which brings together the 100 most valuable companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as a result of a quarterly review, the exchange said in a statement Wednesday.

The fashion house is now valued at £2.23 billion ($2.93 billion), 56% less than it was worth at the end of last year, as its share price has slid on the back of what one analyst has called a “long losing streak” with sales and profits.

Spending on luxury goods has been slowing globally but particularly in the world’s no. 2 economy China, hitting not only the likes of Burberry but also higher-end brands.

In July, the company replaced its chief executive — who had spent just two years in the role — after another disappointing quarter. It also warned that profit in the financial year ending in early 2025 was likely to be lower than expected and scrapped its dividend for the year.

The company, best known for its trench coats and purses, saw sales tumble more than 20% in the April-to-June period, signaling another tough year ahead. In the year ending on March 30, 2024, Burberry’s profit plunged 34%.

“We are taking decisive action to rebalance our offer to be more familiar to Burberry’s core customers whilst delivering relevant newness,” the company’s chairman Gerry Murphy said in July. “We expect the actions we are taking, including cost savings, to start to deliver an improvement in our second half.”

While the brand’s troubles have been partly blamed on its direction, many of the world’s best-known luxury companies are struggling. Their woes mostly reflect a striking turnaround in spending by Chinese shoppers, who had splurged on premium goods after pandemic restrictions in the country were finally lifted.

business,"Most striking hotel workers are back on the job, but the strike continues in San Diego",2024-09-04,Chris Isidore,"New York CNN —

Most of the 10,000 hotel workers who went on strike during the busy Labor Day weekend have returned to work Wednesday, but one group of 700 union members in San Diego will stay on strike for the foreseeable future.

Those workers, employed at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, will remain on strike until there is a contract agreement, their union, Unite Here, says.

The Hilton San Diego Bayfront will remain open during the strike, just as all of the hotels that were targeted by the work action remained open during the weekend, spokespeople for the hotel chains told CNN ahead of the walkouts. Guests had to deal with noisy picket lines and reduced service from skeleton crews working in the hotels, which included Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott properties.

The union and members say that in many cases workers are now being paid less than before the pandemic due to reduced hours and tips, even as travel demand returns and profits in the hotel sector soar.

“During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind,” said Gwen Mills, the union’s international president, in a statement Wednesday. “Workers aren’t making enough to support their families, and many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to. We won’t accept a ‘new normal’ where hotel companies profit by cutting their offerings to guests and abandoning their commitments to workers.”

The union wants services such as daily room cleaning restored. The union says lack of daily room cleaning not only inconveniences guests but makes housekeeping jobs more difficult since each room requires more work to clean when they have gone days without being serviced. It also reduces the number of housekeeping jobs by 39%, according to the union.

The affected hotel companies all say they remain committed to reaching fair deals with the union, and that they are doing what they can to make sure guests are not inconvenienced by the strike.

The strike, which affected as many as 25 hotels in nine US cities over Labor Day weekend, was planned as a limited duration walk-out. Unite Here has used that strategy in previous strikes, including one at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties, California, that started on July 4 weekend last year. The union later staged a series of rolling strikes at different properties in subsequent months, often tied to busy travel periods, such as when Taylor Swift came to Los Angeles for several concerts.

Even with the work action, it took the union until this year to reach what it says are record contracts with most of the Southern California hotels that were impacted.

The union has not ruled out using the same rolling strikes strategy this time, or expanding the strike to other locations. Union members at a total of 65 hotels nationwide had authorized astrike going into this past weekend.

The limited duration strikes are a relatively new strategy for US unions, but they’re common in some other countries, notably in Europe. The strategy is intended to help workers keep as many days of pay as possible during a contract negotiation. Beyond the hotel workers, limited duration strikes have been used to win labor deals for school employees in Los Angeles, health care workers at Kaiser Permanente, janitors, nursing home employees and other workers in Minnesota who went on strike together in March."

tech,"‘From the River to the Sea’ is not hate speech, Meta’s Oversight Board rules",2024-09-04,Ramishah Maruf,"New York CNN —

Meta’s Oversight Board has found that the phrase “From the River to the Sea,” used to express Palestinian support, did not break the company’s hate speech policies.

Critics of the phrase, which refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, say that it calls for the abolishment of the Israeli state. The Anti-Defamation League accused the slogan of being antisemitic and a “rallying cry (that) has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas.”

But the chant is also frequently used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations by protesters who say it is to call for equal rights and an independent state for Palestinians. It can refer to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who are restricted in their movements and from visiting Jerusalem.

The Board said it reviewed three cases involving the use of “From the River to the Sea” on Facebook and said that all appeals to remove the content were closed without human review. Those users then appealed to the Board, which exists for users to challenge Meta’s appeals process on Facebook, Instagram or Threads.

“Specifically, the three pieces of content contain contextual signs of solidarity with Palestinians – but no language calling for violence or exclusion. They also do not glorify or even refer to Hamas, an organization designated as dangerous by Meta,” the decision said. The posts and comments also didn’t contain threats of violence or physical harm.

Though the majority of the Board agreed the phrase has multiple meanings, the decision noted that a minority believed it glorifies Hamas because it appeared in the group’s 2017 charter.

“The phrase’s use by this terrorist group with explicit violent eliminationist intent and actions, does not make the phrase inherently hateful or violent – considering the variety of people using the phrase in different ways,” the Board said.

The Board said the decision underscores tensions in protecting free expression and political speech.

In June, a Palestinian-American engineer sued Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech and wrongfully firing him when he investigated those issues.

“The employee was dismissed for violating Meta’s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN at the time.

The company said it is expanding on its hate speech policies. In July, Meta said it would remove posts that have the term “Zionist” when used in conjunction with antisemitic tropes or dehumanizing rhetoric.

“These cases have again underscored the importance of data access to effectively assess Meta’s content moderation during conflicts, as well as the need for a method to track the amount of content attacking people based on a protected characteristic,” the decision said.

The chant had been contentious even before the Israel and Hamas war, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians after Hamas’ October 7th attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostage. For example, in 2018 CNN said it severed ties with a liberal pundit after he called for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.”

But new attention has been drawn to the chant as protesters call for an end to the war, and the phrase is frequently used at protests ranging from college campuses to large cities. In Germany, using the slogan “From the river to the sea” is now a criminal offense. In December, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) filed a discrimination complaint on behalf of a Black Muslim Arab American teacher in Maryland after she was placed on administrative leave for her email signature, which contained the slogan. US Congress member Rashida Tlaib was censured for using the phrase.

The slogan used in the cases had wide reach through Meta’s platforms. In one case, a likely AI-generated image of floating watermelon slices that formed the slogan was viewed about eight million times and reported by 937 users.

business,Walmart is taking dollar stores’ customers,2024-09-04,Nathaniel Meyersohn,"New York CNN —

After years of prolific growth, US dollar stores have hit a downturn.

Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares plunged 20% Wednesday after the company cut its outlook for the rest of the year, citing “immense pressures” on its low- and middle-income customer base. Dollar Tree also owns the long-struggling Family Dollar chain.

The stock slump came on the heels of Dollar General (DG) slashing its full-year forecast, sending shares to their worst day on record last week.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree have been the fastest-growing retailers by new store openings in recent years, capitalizing on factors such as entrenched poverty in many areas of the country, a shrinking middle class and rival retailers’ store closures. Investors drove the companies’ stock up, assuming that dollar stores were protected from broader economic challenges because customers flock there to save money when times are tough.

But that theory is buckling.

While dollar stores once expanded to reach a growing number of financially strapped Americans, they underestimated just how financially strapped many Americans would become.

The companies have hit trouble as low-income customers struggle to afford basic necessities and dial back their spending, strategic mistakes haunt their business and competition from Walmart and other chains increases.

“The dollar store sector seems to be facing existential uncertainties,” UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients last week.

Low-income customers struggling

Dollar General — which has more than 20,000 stores predominantly in rural towns — said last week that higher prices, a softer job market and higher borrowing costs have pressured low-income customers.

More than 60% of Dollar General’s sales come from households earning less than $35,000 annually.

“Inflation has continued to negatively impact these households, with more than 60% claiming they have had to sacrifice on purchasing basic necessities due to the higher cost of those items,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on an analyst call. Customers also are paying more for expenses such as rent, utilities and health care, he said.

Customers have been pulling back on essential items at Dollar General and struggling to stretch their budgets to the end of the month, Vasos said.

Dollar Tree, which has more than 8,000 stores primarily in suburban markets and caters to middle-income consumers, said that its customers were under strain as well.

“We started to see inflation, interest rates and other macro pressures have a more pronounced impact on the buying behavior” of customers, Dollar Tree chief operating officer Mike Creedon said Wednesday. Dollar Tree’s discretionary merchandise sales, such as party supplies and home decorations, have slumped.

Other companies have also recently pointed to low-income customers’ weakness, including McDonald’s.

Strategic mistakes

Economic challenges aren’t the only reasons the two chains are in turmoil. Both companies have made strategic missteps.

Historically, most of Dollar General’s sales have come from its “consumables” division: low-margin food, cleaning and household supplies and personal care products. In recent years, Dollar General has focused on growing the discretionary side of its business. The company has added assortments of pillows, candles, home decorations, gift bags and wrapping paper.

But this merchandise has sat on store shelves, forcing the company to mark down products to try to clear them away.

“They’re trying to dig out from a failed non-consumable strategy where they have lots of inventory,” David D’Arezzo, a former top executive at Dollar General and other retailers, told CNN. “They missed the fact in tough times the consumer would be looking for consumables.”

Meanwhile, Dollar Tree has been weighed down by its purchase of Family Dollar.

Dollar Tree bought its rival in 2015 for $8.5 billion, believing acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against larger companies. But it misjudged the deal.

Earlier this year, Dollar Tree announced that Family Dollar will close more than 900 stores, and it subsequently said it will explore a sale or spinoff of Family Dollar. On Wednesday, executives said that process was ongoing.

“Dollar Tree has ensnared itself in a web of problems with Family Dollar and untangling itself from the mess will not be a simple process,” Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said in a note to clients Wedensday.

The Walmart effect

Competition is also biting into dollar stores’ business.

Walmart, Target and other chains have lowered prices on some items in an effort to draw inflation-fatigued shoppers, taking a toll on trips to dollar stores.

Dollar General CEO Vasos acknowledged last week that Walmart has been “doing a pretty nice job” in appealing to shoppers from other chains who are looking for low prices.

In previous times of financial stress, Dollar General has seen middle-income and slightly more affluent households trade down into Dollar General to save money. That has not happened recently, however, as more affluent customers are increasing their spending at Walmart.

Walmart has grown recently with people making more than $100,000 a year and gained market share.

“I don’t believe that anybody in the world shares more customers than Dollar General and Walmart because of their close proximity to each other and the density of their locations in the southeast,” David D’Arezzo said. “When Walmart is doing well, Dollar General struggles.”"
business,US regulators want to investigate Shein and Temu over ‘deadly’ baby products,2024-09-04,Jordan Valinsky,"New York CNN —

Shein and Temu, two Chinese low-cost e-commerce websites, are the target of a proposed investigation by the United States government for selling “deadly baby and toddler products.”

Two leaders from the Consumer Products Safety Commission said in an open letter Wednesday that they want commission staff to look into how the two companies comply with US safety regulations.

Pointing to “recent media reports” that dangerous products sold for kids are easy to find on the websites, CPSC commissioners Peter Feldman and Douglas Dziak said they want to “better understand these firms, particularly their focus on low-value direct-to-consumer” shipments

One particular concern for the Commission is the companies’ use of “de minmis,” a rule that exempts shipments valued at $800 or less from tariffs. Much of the products sold on Shein and Temu are cheap and range from furniture to fast fashion.

“As the Commission sets its priorities for next year, we expect agency staff to investigate the companies’ safety and compliance controls; relationships with third-party sellers and consumers; and any representations they make when products are imported,” Feldman and Dziak wrote.

Shein said in a comment to CNN that customer safety is its “top priority and we are investing millions of dollars to strengthen our compliance programs.” Temu said that it “requires all sellers on our platform to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to product safety.”

As the two companies grow in popularity, especially in the US, they’re also facing scrutiny and questions over a litany of issues, including how they’re able to sell goods at such strikingly low prices, how transparent they are with the public and how much environmental waste their businesses generate.

Last year, a US congressional commission called out Shein and Temu in a report that suggested the companies and others in China were potentially linked to the use of forced labor, exploitation of trade loopholes, product safety hazards or intellectual property theft."

success,What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates,2024-07-27,Jeanne Sahadi,"New York CNN —

Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.

If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.

Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.

Timing and magnitude matter

The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much you’ll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.”

“Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.

By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said. “And for savers, [the initial declines] won’t wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.”

That’s because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won’t meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.

“Don’t jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.

Here’s a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it.

Your home

Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed’s moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.

For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That’s because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.

To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.

Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn’t stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.”

As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it’s no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won’t make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. “Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn’t make it free money.”

Of course, if you’re just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.

And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down. It’s high-cost debt that won’t get cheaper soon.”

Your credit cards

Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance s . A few rate cuts won’t make much of a dent in today’s record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan.

That’s why, if you’re carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.

If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. “They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said.

Your car

If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.

“Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you’re financing and your credit rating,” he said.

As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.

Your savings

The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%.

While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren’t likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts.

But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. “I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.

His advice: Don’t keep more than six months’ to a year’s worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. “Anything more than that and you’re putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said.

That said, McBride suggested that if you’re within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you’ll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won’t be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement.

For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.” A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.

“The call feature is a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ for the issuing bank,” McBride said."
success,What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates,2024-07-27,Jeanne Sahadi,"New York CNN —

Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.

If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.

Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.

success,Early signs of dementia can show in your finances,2024-07-08,Jeanne Sahadi,"New York CNN —

Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases.

When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia.

Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise.

“The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.”

Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

‘Methodical’ military spouse’s record-keeping deteriorates

Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since.

Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military.

After going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.”

For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.”

Former finance executive accrues piles of unpaid bills, finances new car he didn’t need

Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers.

Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest.

Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said.

What’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties.

“I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said.

Two parents with dementia, one daughter’s efforts to reduce financial worry

Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it.

Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care.

“The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said.

Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked.

Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care.

While her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties.

To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes.

Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.”

With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store).

Early planning lessens some stress

While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated.

In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise.

That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online.

“The time to make plans is before you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably.

Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia.

Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”"

success,"How to pick a good, affordable college before applying",2024-06-17,Jeanne Sahadi,"New York CNN —

Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn’t be any different than shopping for a home. When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family’s needs and fall within your price range.

“Adopt a mindset that we’re buying college like we’re buying a house,” said Beth Walker, author of “Buying College Better” and “Never Pay Retail for College.”

As a financial adviser and certified college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies — and gets into — schools they cannot afford because the schools won’t give them enough aid. And then they just … try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student.

Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family — so parents don’t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn’t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child’s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to.

Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one “where a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.”

In helping families align parents’ affordability constraints with their student’s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn’t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won’t get much aid to attend.

In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don’t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you’re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges.

Set up financial guardrails well before the college search

Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child’s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don’t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS).

“If you’re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don’t blow up your retirement,” he said.

The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you’re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child’s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming.

The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you’re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don’t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt — including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans — to exceed 43%.

If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said.

“If folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better. For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,” Fothergill said.

Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships).

Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid

Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. “The student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,” Walker said.

Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum’s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses.

Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you‘ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended “safety” schools or “reach” schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in.

Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge how competitive their profile is at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use.

For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board.

Other ways to reduce college costs before applying

While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education.

One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship.

Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn’t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board.

Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition.

A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take.

No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: “We have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.”"
success,"How to pick a good, affordable college before applying",2024-06-17,Jeanne Sahadi,"New York CNN —

Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn’t be any different than shopping for a home. When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family’s needs and fall within your price range.

“Adopt a mindset that we’re buying college like we’re buying a house,” said Beth Walker, author of “Buying College Better” and “Never Pay Retail for College.”

As a financial adviser and certified college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies — and gets into — schools they cannot afford because the schools won’t give them enough aid. And then they just … try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student.

Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family — so parents don’t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn’t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child’s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to.

Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one “where a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.”

In helping families align parents’ affordability constraints with their student’s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn’t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won’t get much aid to attend.

In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don’t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you’re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges.

Set up financial guardrails well before the college search

Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child’s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don’t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS).

“If you’re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don’t blow up your retirement,” he said.

The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you’re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child’s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming.

The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you’re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don’t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt — including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans — to exceed 43%.

If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said.

“If folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better. For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,” Fothergill said.

Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships).

Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid

Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. “The student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,” Walker said.

Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum’s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses.

Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid.

success,"Unhappy workers may reduce global GDP by as much as 9%, Gallup estimates",2024-06-13,Jeanne Sahadi,"New York CNN —

Employees’ negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement – and the economy, according to a new report released this week.

Gallup, in its “State of the Global Workplace,” estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP.

The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year.

That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress.

Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%).

While work isn’t always the cause of a person’s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That’s because work can either improve or worsen employees’ well-being.

On the one hand, the Gallup report noted, “when employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.”

On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person’s wellbeing as much as — or more than — not having a job at all. “Employees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,” they wrote. “On many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.”

Engaged managers help workers thrive

The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone “highly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological ‘owners,’ drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.”

But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as “psychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.”

Engagement levels are highest in so-called “best practice” organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders’ emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development.

The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. “[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,” the report said. And, it added, “high-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing — as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales — than low-engagement teams.”

Where the most and least stressed workers are

Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup’s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%).

But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%).

By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%)."

tech,Nvidia has more than just billions of dollars in value to lose if its stock keeps falling,2024-09-05,Allison Morrow,"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.

New York CNN —

Nvidia, the nearly $3 trillion AI chip maker, is well known as a “golden handcuffs” employer. Expect long hours, screaming-match meetings, a CEO who believes he should “torture” his employees into greatness — your standard tech startup-turned-juggernaut nightmare.

In exchange, you get to be rich, possibly very rich, thanks to your equity in the company. It’s a common Silicon Valley compensation model — young companies that are light on cash but brimming with potential can attract talent by promising shares on top of a salary, giving each employee a personal incentive in its success. It’s worked especially well for Nvidia, a 30-year-old tech company whose specialized chips now account for 90% of AI-related chip sales.

Since 2019, Nvidia’s stock has soared 3,000% — minting millionaires among its rank and file.

But as the chip maker’s stock slides, those handcuffs could lose some of their luster.

Here’s the deal: Last week, just before Nvidia released its quarterly earnings, Bloomberg published a deeply reported account of life inside Nvidia, citing 10 current and former employees.

To hear them tell it, it isn’t the kind of depraved tech frat house that you might associate with a company as buzzy and suddenly flush as Nvidia (pronounced en-VID-eeyah).

Still, workers described a standard of overwork that would make even Wall Street bankers wince.

Many of the people Bloomberg quoted said they worked seven days a week, often well past midnight. One said she spent her days attending as many as 10 meetings, which often involved loud squabbles in front of dozens of colleagues. There seems to be no limit on how many direct reports one manager may have. The founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, who has publicly touted the virtue of suffering for one’s work, has 60.

Despite that chaotic corporate structure, Nvidia’s turnover rate, at 5.3% in 2023, stands well below the industry average of nearly 18%, according to the company’s sustainability report.

It’s hard to turn your back on the promise of life-changing wealth. And at Nvidia’s Santa Clara office, where the parking lots are packed with Porsches and Lambos, you couldn’t even if you tried. Per Bloomberg: “Conversations about Nvidia’s daily market gain or loss (but usually gain) can be heard in hushed tones at lunchtime,” and there is a Slack channel devoted to discussions about personal finance advice.

What’s four years of suffering while you wait for your shares to vest and burnish your resume at one of the most valuable companies on the planet? What’s another four if you can retire early?

To each their own, of course. But for Nvidia as a corporation, the calculus for attracting and retaining talent gets more complicated if one of its biggest selling points — its runaway stock price — comes crashing down.

Nvidia has shed 20% of its market value since its June 18 peak, thanks to a confluence of factors: nerves about the strength of the US economy have fueled a broad tech selloff, and investors are getting tired of waiting on AI companies to prove they have honest-to-God products that can actually make money, rather than just gulp down capital like its tap water.

Things got worse for Nvidia on Tuesday, when shares fell 9.5%, wiping $279 billion off its value. That was the biggest loss in Wall Street history. As my colleague David Goldman noted, only 27 companies on Earth are worth as much as Nvidia lost on Tuesday.

Nvidia and its backers see it as a “picks and shovels” play — the kind of company whose fundamental value is strong even without all the AI hype. But its skeptics point to growing competition in the highly technical space of semiconductors.

Nvidia’s success means it has a target on its back — a fact that could help turn its biggest customers, like Google and Amazon, into its biggest rivals. Competition for talent is bound to heat up, creating opportunities for engineers and other sought-after workers. If Nvidia can’t keep them on board with promises of triple- and quadruple-digit returns, it may have an even bigger problem on its hands."

tech,Brazil’s president says world doesn’t have to put up with Elon Musk’s ‘far right’ ideology just because he’s rich,2024-09-04,Juliana Liu,"Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says the world isn’t obliged to put up with billionaire Elon Musk’s “far-right anything goes” agenda because of his immense wealth.

Lula da Silva made the remarks in an interview with CNN affiliate CNN Brasil published Monday, days after Musk’s social media site X was suspended in the country, making it inaccessible in a major market.

“The Brazilian justice system may have given an important signal that the world is not obliged to put up with Musk’s extreme right-wing anything goes just because he is rich,” the president said.

Lula da Silva’s comments are the latest salvo in a long-running feud with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation in the country. Over the weekend, Brazilians, including the president, bid farewell to X, with some posting links to their profiles on other social media platforms.

Brazil is an important market for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk acquired Twitter and renamed the platform last year. Some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month, according to market research group Emarketer.

Access to the platform was blocked after Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered the suspension of X nationwide, because Musk refused to name a legal representative in the country.

The court had previously issued orders to block multiple X accounts as part of the country’s sweeping investigation into the spread of misinformation online and hate speech aimed at undermining the country’s democracy.

Accounts that the platform has previously shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy.

Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” has repeatedly claimed the court’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil’s political right.

Musk once again waded into Brazilian politics on Tuesday by sharing a link on X to an upcoming demonstration that bills itself as a march for “freedom, protesting judicial overreach and defending free speech.”"

tech,It’s not just you. More weird spam is popping up on Facebook,2024-09-03,Clare Duffy,"New York CNN —

If a strange photo has recently stopped you in your tracks while scrolling your Facebook feed, you’re not alone.

Users who once came to Facebook to connect with friends and family are increasingly complaining of random, spammy, junk content — much of it apparently generated by artificial intelligence — showing up in their feeds.

Sometimes it’s obviously fake, AI-generated images, like the now-infamous “Shrimp Jesus.” Other times, it’s old posts from real creators that look like they’re being reshared by bot accounts for engagement. In some cases, it’s pages sharing streams of seemingly benign but random content — memes or movie clips, shared every few hours.

But the spam is more than just an annoyance; it can also be weaponized. Some spam pages appear designed to scam other users. In extreme cases, spam pages that gain a following can eventually be used, for example, by foreign actors seeking to sow discord ahead of elections, according to experts who study inauthentic behavior online.

The surge coincides with an intentional strategy shift at Facebook in the past few years. The company de-emphasized current events and politics in the wake of claims it had contributed to election manipulation and real-world violence. Feeling the heat from the rise of TikTok and its emphasis on entertainment over social connections, Facebook re-designed users’ home feeds into a “discovery engine” in the hopes that people would engage with content they might not otherwise see.

But the push for more “discoverable” content has led to an algorithm that regularly pushes vapid, often misleading, computer-generated content.

The change has been palpable. AI-generated or recycled meme content has appeared on Facebook’s quarterly most viewed content list. Posts with obviously AI-generated images and confusing captions sometimes receive thousands of likes and hundreds of comments and shares.

Bad actors and engagement farmers are only too happy to fulfill Facebook’s demand for new content, experts say. And the proliferation of AI tools has made it far easier for them to quickly crank out huge volumes of fake images and text.

“It’s a really interesting thing that a lot more people are starting to talk about because it’s this random, kind of vanilla problem now, but obviously there are theoretical, long-term concerns,” said Ben Decker, CEO of online threat analysis firm Memetica.

Facebook parent company Meta, for its part, works “to remove and reduce the spread of spammy content to ensure a positive user experience, offering users controls over their feed and encouraging creators to use AI tools to produce high-quality content that meets our Community Standards,” spokesperson Erin Logan said in a statement. “We also take action against those who attempt to manipulate traffic through inauthentic engagement, regardless of whether they use AI or not.”

Adventures in the AI swamp

Before I started reporting this story in July, my Facebook feed felt pretty normal, featuring baby photos from college friends and listings from Facebook Marketplace.

But, curious about the complaints, I started clicking on whatever content I did see that seemed odd, and the algorithm kicked in. Now, weeks later, nearly every third post on my feed appears to be so-called “AI slop.”

One recent example: a black-and-white image showing a shack in the woods with a family sitting out front, shared by a page called “History for Everyone.”

At first glance, the post looks like something you might find in a history book. But upon closer inspection, the people in the image have blurred, undefined facial features, and the children’s hands and feet seem to disappear into the landscape around them — hallmarks of AI-generated images.

The post’s caption claims the image was taken in 1910 in New Jersey at a “small shack on Forsythe’s Bog, occupied by De Marco family, 10 in the family living in this one room,” by National Child Labor Committee photographer Lewis Hine. Curious, I copied the full caption into Google, which pointed me to the real caption of an entirely different photo that had been published by the Library of Congress.

I plugged the Facebook image into a Google reverse image search, and the only other places it appeared online were two other, similar Facebook groups called “Past Memories” and “History Pictures.”

This screenshot shows an image, which appears to have been manipulated or AI-generated, posted to a Facebook page that posts a stream of ""historical"" images, alongside a caption from a different old photo. CNN could not confirm how the image was created, but AI detection software reported ""substantial evidence"" that the image was computer manipulated. From Facebook

It’s impossible to say definitively how the image was created, but CNN’s photo team ran it through AI-detection software — which is still in early testing — and found “substantial evidence” it had been manipulated. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert and UC Berkeley professor who has studied AI, added that the image appeared to be AI-generated and may have been created by using the caption of the real, historical image as the AI prompt, potentially to avoid copyright infringement.

The group that shared the post, “History for Everyone,” is managed by a page by the same name, which was created in 2022 and previously changed its name from “Cubs” and “Chikn.Nuggit.” The page did not respond to a direct message.

The History for Everyone post is illustrative of a lot of the content that’s come across my feed — uncanny, bizarre, but also seemingly benign.

Other examples include a page called “Amy Couch” that also shares “historical” photos, with an apparently AI-generated profile photo that shows a woman with one giant tooth where her two front teeth should be. Or an art and history page for an “artist” called “Kris Artist” whose profile photo I traced back to a real social media influencer who told me over email: “That is definitely not my account but they are using my picture.”

When I messaged the “Kris Artist” page, I received what appeared to be an automated response: “Hi, thanks for contacting us. We’ve received your message and appreciate you reaching out. Please Join our Group.”

After I flagged the History for Everyone post, as well as the Amy Couch and Kris Artist pages, to Meta, it removed them for violating its spam policy.

Behind the AI slop

It’s not clear exactly how much of this content exists on Facebook. But there may be lots of people seeing it. The “History for Everyone” page has more than 40,000 followers, although individual posts often receive just a handful of interactions.

Researchers from Stanford and Georgetown earlier this year tracked 120 Facebook pages that frequently posted AI-generated images — and found the images collectively received “hundreds of millions of engagements and exposures,” according to a paper released in March, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.

“The Facebook Feed … at times shows users AI-generated images even when they do not follow the Pages posting those images. We suspect that AI-generated images appear on users’ Feeds because the Facebook Feed ranking algorithm promotes content that is likely to generate engagement,” researchers Renee DiResta and Josh Goldstein wrote in the paper. They added that often the users engaging with that content didn’t seem to realize it was AI.

Experts who track this kind of online behavior say there are likely several different kinds of actors behind the Facebook spam, with varying motives.

Some just want to make money, for example through bonus payments that Facebook pays out to creators posting public content. There are dozens of YouTube videos teaching people how to get paid for posting AI content on Facebook — as tech news site 404 Media reported earlier this month — with some claiming they make thousands of dollars each month using the tactic.

“Even in the realm of the political, the tactics of manipulators have long been previewed by those with a different motivation: making money. Spammers and scammers are often early adopters of new technologies,” the Stanford researchers wrote.

On other pages, scammers use the comments as a place to hawk sham products or collect users’ personal information.

In some cases, what looks like a harmless account sharing mostly random content will slip in occasional misinformation or offensive memes, as a way of evading Facebook’s enforcement mechanisms. “If something looks just like a run-of-the-mill spam campaign, it might not trigger the company’s top investigators … and so it might go undetected for longer,” said David Evan Harris, an AI researcher who previously worked on responsible AI at Meta.

Harris added that there is also an online market for “aged” Facebook accounts, because older accounts are more likely to appear human and evade the platform’s spam filters.

“It’s like a black market, basically, you can sell someone 1,000 of these accounts that are all five years or older, and then they can turn those into a scam or an influence operation,” Harris said. “This is something you see in elections: Someone might make a Facebook group that’s like, ‘everybody loves cheeseburgers,’ and the group posts images of the best cheeseburgers every day for two years, and then all of a sudden, a month before an election … it becomes a ‘vote for (former Brazilian President Jair) Bolsonaro’ group.”

What to do with AI spam?

With AI tools, bad actors no longer need lots of people to rapidly produce reams of fake content — the technology can do it for them.

For Facebook to identify all of the AI-generated images getting uploaded each day without making mistakes would be challenging, “particularly at a time when this technology is moving so incredibly fast,” Farid said. Even if it could, “that doesn’t mean you should ban all AI generated content, right? … It’s a very subtle question on policy,” he said.

Earlier this year, Meta said it would add “AI info” tags to content created by certain third-party generators that use metadata to let other sites know AI was involved. Meta also automatically labels AI-generated images created with its own tools.

However, there are still ways for users to strip out that metadata (or create AI images without it) to evade detection.

Meta may also be hampered by a smaller team dedicated to addressing fake content, after it — like other tech giants — trimmed its trust and safety staff last year, meaning it must rely more on automated moderation systems that can be gamed.

“Digitally savvy social media communities have always been one and a half steps ahead of trust and safety efforts at all platforms … it’s almost a cat and mouse game that never really ends,” Harris said."
tech,It’s not just you. More weird spam is popping up on Facebook,2024-09-03,Clare Duffy,"New York CNN —

If a strange photo has recently stopped you in your tracks while scrolling your Facebook feed, you’re not alone.

Users who once came to Facebook to connect with friends and family are increasingly complaining of random, spammy, junk content — much of it apparently generated by artificial intelligence — showing up in their feeds.

Sometimes it’s obviously fake, AI-generated images, like the now-infamous “Shrimp Jesus.” Other times, it’s old posts from real creators that look like they’re being reshared by bot accounts for engagement. In some cases, it’s pages sharing streams of seemingly benign but random content — memes or movie clips, shared every few hours.

But the spam is more than just an annoyance; it can also be weaponized. Some spam pages appear designed to scam other users. In extreme cases, spam pages that gain a following can eventually be used, for example, by foreign actors seeking to sow discord ahead of elections, according to experts who study inauthentic behavior online.

The surge coincides with an intentional strategy shift at Facebook in the past few years. The company de-emphasized current events and politics in the wake of claims it had contributed to election manipulation and real-world violence. Feeling the heat from the rise of TikTok and its emphasis on entertainment over social connections, Facebook re-designed users’ home feeds into a “discovery engine” in the hopes that people would engage with content they might not otherwise see.

But the push for more “discoverable” content has led to an algorithm that regularly pushes vapid, often misleading, computer-generated content.

The change has been palpable. AI-generated or recycled meme content has appeared on Facebook’s quarterly most viewed content list. Posts with obviously AI-generated images and confusing captions sometimes receive thousands of likes and hundreds of comments and shares.

Bad actors and engagement farmers are only too happy to fulfill Facebook’s demand for new content, experts say. And the proliferation of AI tools has made it far easier for them to quickly crank out huge volumes of fake images and text.

“It’s a really interesting thing that a lot more people are starting to talk about because it’s this random, kind of vanilla problem now, but obviously there are theoretical, long-term concerns,” said Ben Decker, CEO of online threat analysis firm Memetica.

Facebook parent company Meta, for its part, works “to remove and reduce the spread of spammy content to ensure a positive user experience, offering users controls over their feed and encouraging creators to use AI tools to produce high-quality content that meets our Community Standards,” spokesperson Erin Logan said in a statement. “We also take action against those who attempt to manipulate traffic through inauthentic engagement, regardless of whether they use AI or not.”

Adventures in the AI swamp

Before I started reporting this story in July, my Facebook feed felt pretty normal, featuring baby photos from college friends and listings from Facebook Marketplace.

But, curious about the complaints, I started clicking on whatever content I did see that seemed odd, and the algorithm kicked in. Now, weeks later, nearly every third post on my feed appears to be so-called “AI slop.”

One recent example: a black-and-white image showing a shack in the woods with a family sitting out front, shared by a page called “History for Everyone.”

At first glance, the post looks like something you might find in a history book. But upon closer inspection, the people in the image have blurred, undefined facial features, and the children’s hands and feet seem to disappear into the landscape around them — hallmarks of AI-generated images.

The post’s caption claims the image was taken in 1910 in New Jersey at a “small shack on Forsythe’s Bog, occupied by De Marco family, 10 in the family living in this one room,” by National Child Labor Committee photographer Lewis Hine. Curious, I copied the full caption into Google, which pointed me to the real caption of an entirely different photo that had been published by the Library of Congress.

I plugged the Facebook image into a Google reverse image search, and the only other places it appeared online were two other, similar Facebook groups called “Past Memories” and “History Pictures.”

This screenshot shows an image, which appears to have been manipulated or AI-generated, posted to a Facebook page that posts a stream of ""historical"" images, alongside a caption from a different old photo. CNN could not confirm how the image was created, but AI detection software reported ""substantial evidence"" that the image was computer manipulated. From Facebook

tech,Elon Musk hits out at judge threatening to suspend X in Brazil,2024-08-29,Duarte Mendonca,"Elon Musk has stepped up online attacks on a Supreme Court judge threatening to suspend social media platform X in Brazil, calling him “an evil dictator” in an ongoing feud between the two men.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes had threatened to suspend X if Musk did not appoint a new legal representative of the company in Brazil and settle any outstanding daily fines within 24 hours.

“Alexandre de Moraes is an evil dictator cosplaying as a judge,” the world’s richest person wrote on X.

Musk, who had previously called de Moraes “Darth Vader,” retweeted a statement from X’s Global Government Affairs team saying it would publish the judge’s “illegal demands and all related court filings” in the coming days.

Brazil is a major market for social media platforms. About 40 million Brazilians, or about 18% of the population, access X at least once per month, according to the Associated Press.

The trash talking marks the latest salvo in Musk’s feud with de Moraes, which centers on arguments over free speech and alleged disinformation. X announced earlier this month that it would close its operations and fire its staff in Brazil due to what it called “censorship orders” from the judge.

De Moraes had ordered the social media company to block several X accounts he said were spreading disinformation.

The latest statement, which was signed by de Moraes, was also shared on the Supreme Court’s official X account, tagging both Musk and X’s Global Government Affairs account.

The statement from the Supreme Court was posted at around 8.30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, giving Musk until Thursday evening local time to respond.

‘Censorship orders’

On August 17, X published a lengthy statement saying it would be forced to close operations and fire staff in Brazil due to de Moraes’ “censorship orders.”

“Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process,” the X statement said.

“As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately. The X service remains available to the people of Brazil. We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision. The responsibility lies solely with Alexandre de Moraes.”

Later that day, Musk reiterated the official X statement, saying his company had “no choice” but to close Brazilian operations.

“Due to demands by ‘Justice’ Alexandre [de Moraes] in Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, X has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil,” he said in an X post."

media,DirecTV files FCC complaint against Disney amid blackout,2024-09-08,Robert Ilich,"DirecTV filed a complaint Saturday with the Federal Communications Commission alleging Disney did not negotiate in good faith as the two sides remain at an impasse on a distribution deal.

“Disney has violated the FCC’s good faith mandates by predicating any licensing agreement on DIRECTV’s waiving any legal claims on Disney’s past, current, or future anticompetitive actions, including its ongoing packaging and minimum penetration demands,” a DirecTV spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.

In the 10-page complaint, DirecTV claimed the negotiations stalled because, “Disney insists on bundling and penetration requirements that a federal district court judge in New York recently found in the context of the ‘Venu’ joint venture to be unlawful, anticompetitive, and ‘bad for consumers.’”

On August 16, a federal judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, a joint sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox Corporation and Warner Brothers Discovery after Fubo, a sports streaming service, filed a lawsuit against the media giants. Warner Brothers Discovery is the parent company of CNN.

More than 11 million subscribers have been affected by Disney pulling its ABC stations, ESPN and other cable networks from DirecTV’s lineup last week. The blackout came ahead of the upcoming presidential debate on ABC between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the final rounds of US Open tennis and the start of the NFL season. ESPN owns the broadcast rights to “Monday Night Football,” which will be blacked out for DirecTV subscribers unless a deal is reached.

“We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible,” a Disney spokesperson told CNN on Sunday. “We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of Monday Night Football.”

DirecTV subscribers have been blacked out of Disney’s owned-and-operated ABC local stations in six major media markets — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston and San Francisco — as well as the smaller markets of Fresno, California, and Raleigh, North Carolina.

The opening game for “Monday Night Football” features the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers. In 2023, the first “Monday Night Football” game — a matchup between the Buffalo Bills and the Jets — drew 22.64 million viewers, its biggest audience of the ESPN era, which dates back to 2006.

The blackout also includes ESPN’s suite of channels and the Disney Channel, Disney Jr., FX and National Geographic."

media,How some of the biggest right-wing media stars ended up as unwitting puppets of Russian propaganda,2024-09-07,Hadas Gold,"They’re not on any of the major television networks, but they have millions of viewers. Now, the Justice Department is alleging that some of the biggest stars in right-wing social media were, unwittingly, part of a sinister Russian operation to influence the 2024 US election.

The personalities weren’t directly named or accused of wrongdoing by the Justice Department, but court documents unsealed Wednesday revealed Russian state media producers funneled nearly $10 million to an unnamed Tennessee-based online media company. The company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media, boasts a slate of high-profile right-wing commentators as “talent,” including Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen, Matt Christiansen and Dave Rubin, collectively boasting millions of followers across social media platforms.

Two Russian state media employees were charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and money laundering.

The secret payments pull back the curtain on some of the most popular right-wing personalities, who were paid millions of dollars by the Kremlin, without their knowledge according to the Justice Department to promote conservative narratives that furthered Russian interests. And while the influencer, podcaster, and online content creator space is booming, the indictment shows how open the new media ecosystem is to infiltration, where independent creators operate with few guardrails and little transparency.

What is Tenet Media?

Tenet Media launched last year, describing itself as “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues” with six commentators, all of whom had established online presences in the conservative media ecosystem.

Some of Tenet’s commentators had careers at more mainstream media outlets prior to striking out on their own: Tim Pool was a reporter at Vice Media and Benny Johnson was a writer at BuzzFeed and the Independent Journal Review (Johnson was let go from both outlets) before becoming MAGA influencers.

Rubin, once known as a libertarian who worked at the progressive network The Young Turks before making a right turn into conservative media, hosts his show “The Rubin Report” on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze and YouTube. Others, like Lauren Southern, have made their name in the online alt-right, White nationalism spaces (Southern has previously denied being a White nationalist).

The commentators assembled by Tenet boasted more than 6 million YouTube subscribers, but their influence has extended well beyond the Google-owned video platform. Pool, known for donning a black beanie on his broadcasts, has used his show to host far-right extremists, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Jack Posobiec. Earlier this year, Pool interviewed former President Donald Trump on his podcast.

Johnson, who boasts nearly 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and is a former chief creative officer of the right-wing activist group Turning Point USA, interviewed Donald Trump Jr. on the Tenet platform in February.

The influencers’ deals with Tenet varied, with the outlet exclusively hosting some of their shows while also cross posting the creators’ other content. According to the indictment, one of the unnamed social media stars was paid $400,000 per month to create videos for the platform, with another unnamed influencer also receiving a $100,000 signing bonus.

Christiansen said during a live stream Wednesday that he was approached last June by Tenet Media co-founders Lauren Chen and her husband, Liam Donovan to join the network, claiming that they could help him get more “eyes” on his content. Neither Chen or Donovan are named in the indictment.

Chen, a right-wing media personality who hosted a show for Glenn Beck’s “The Blaze” and contributed to Turning Point USA, had amassed more than 572,000 subscribers on her YouTube account before it was taken down Thursday. Blaze Media fired Chen the day after the indictment was unsealed by the Justice Department.

Representatives for Tenet did not return a request for comment.

Russian narratives on display

According to the indictment, employees from Russian state media outlet RT allegedly funded and directed the company, hoping to plug in to the commentators’ vast network of fans to exploit divisive narratives that achieved the Kremlin’s goals. Much of the partnership appeared to simply amplify what were already simpatico views between the Kremlin and the company’s influencers. According to intelligence agencies the Kremlin has sought to boost Donald Trump’s candidacy, questioning the West’s support for Ukraine and criticizing elements of the LGBTQ movement.

The Justice Department said the views in the influencer videos promoted Kremlin interests and narratives, including increasing domestic division and aimed “to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine.”

While Russia and the Republican Party under Trump have become increasingly aligned in their views, Russia’s military action in Ukraine became fodder for Tenet’s influencers.

“Ukraine is the enemy of this country!,” Pool yelled on a live stream last month. “Ukraine is our enemy, being funded by the Democrats. I will stress again, one of the greatest enemies of our nation right now is Ukraine.”

In another instance the Russian funders directly asked a Tenet co-founder on or about March 23 to “blame Ukraine and the United States” for a terrorist attack on a concert hall outside of Moscow that killed more than 130 people. While ISIS took responsibility for the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin insinuated Ukraine had a role in the massacre. Kyiv denied any role in the massacre.

“Founder-I responded that Founder-I would ask Commentator-3, and, the next day, confirmed that Commentator-3 said, “he’s happy to cover it,” the indictment stated. The identity of “Commentator-3” is not yet clear.

The day before on March 22, Johnson suggested in a video on his personal channel that Ukraine may be connected to the attack, saying he found it “a little too on the nose for me” for the US to have issued a warning about possible terrorist attacks in the days before the attack took place. It is not clear whether Johnson is “commentator-3” or whether he happened to have already posted a video that fit in with the request. Johnson has denied any knowledge of the Russian funding and has asserted his editorial independence.

In a post on X on Saturday evening, Johnson denied any connection between the request outlined in the indictment and his show. “I never received any request for coverage, never covered this on Tenet and never covered the topic again on any platform,” he said.

Other narratives pushed by the Russian-paid influencers fit in with the Kremlin’s goals, such as fear mongering about migrant gangs and boosting the candidacy of Trump, who US intelligence agencies said Russia supported in the 2020 election.

In 2022, Pool said that while a mass shooting attack on a Colorado LGBTQ nightclub where a man killed five people and injured 19 was “wrong,” he suggested that the club, which had held an “all ages drag brunch” meant it supported “grooming children.”

“We shouldn’t tolerate pedophiles grooming kids,” Pool posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Club Q had a grooming event. How do prevent the violence and stop the grooming?”

The notion that LGBTQpeople are pedophiles or groomers is an extreme homophobic conspiracy theory that is often floated in far-right circles as a justification for anti-LGBTQ policies.

Last November, Rubin attacked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has called Putin a “monster,” after Trudeau urged Israel to show restraint in its military campaign against Hamas following the October 7 attack.

Trudeau is “an evil communist piece of sh–,” Rubin wrote in an X post, who should “just come out of the closet already,” neither statements are true.

The Justice Department said the commentators were not aware that the source of the funding originated with Russia, and at least one of the commentators was told a fake European investor named Eduard Grigoriann was behind the payments.

“In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”

The Tenet influencers who have spoken out since the indictment was unsealed have all said they were unaware of the Russian funding and that they were victims of the scheme.

“Never at any point did anyone other than I have full editorial control of the show and the contents of the show are often apolitical,” Pool said.

At least three of the commentators have publicly stated they were later contacted by the FBI for voluntary interviews as possible victims of a crime.

“Overt shilling”

The Russians also pushed Tenet to promote videos that were going viral on social media, according to the indictment. In one case, Tenet staffers were asked to repost a video of “a well-known U.S. political commentator,” thought to be former Fox News host Tucker Carlson visiting a grocery store in Russia in February, where Carlson fawned over the quality, selection and price of groceries.

“It just feels like overt shilling,” one employee identified as “Producer-1” wrote in an internal chat to one of the company’s founders, according to the indictment.

But the producer eventually acquiesced to pressure from one of Tenet’s founders, responding, “alright I’ll put it out tomorrow,” the indictment said.

“This is why information laundering is so pernicious,” said disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz, a co-founder of the American Sunlight Project. “These folks are after their bottom line, so they post rage bait that will perform well, rake in views and likes, and make their ‘producers’ happy.”

“These folks aren’t doing due diligence about who is paying them, and millions of Americans are going to them for ‘unvarnished’ takes on the news of the day,” she added.

Tenet Media has not responded to requests for comment and stopped posting content on Wednesday. One of the company’s listed talent, Tayler Hansen, posted Thursday “TENET Media has ended after the DOJ indictment.”

Russia’s long running influence campaigns

The Russian government has a long history of tapping Americans as part of disinformation and influence operations aimed at stoking divisions in the US and promoting Russia’s interests.

In recent years, Russia has successfully leveraged social media and the anonymity provided by the internet to infiltrate American social movements on the right and on the left. Sometimes this was in the form of trolls and bots, but other cases involved real Americans unwittingly doing the bidding of Russian agents.

After the 2016 US presidential election, congressional and federal investigations showed Moscow had successfully co-opted unwitting Americans to stage protests, run social media accounts and host events at its behest. In Soviet Cold War jargon, they’re referred to as “useful idiots” — people who don’t know they are doing Russia’s bidding.

“Well-resourced state actors use broadcast & social media simultaneously, across the overt to covert spectrum,” wrote Renee DiResta, a former research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory and author of the book “Invisible Rulers: The People Who Turn Lies Into Reality.”

“At this point there are a bunch of strategies Russia is working concurrently; as one is made more costly/less effective, they leverage others,” she added. “This situation is essentially a front media operation - a fairly old approach, though now the most effective useful idiots may be influencers rather than journalists of yore.”

media,How some of the biggest right-wing media stars ended up as unwitting puppets of Russian propaganda,2024-09-07,Hadas Gold,"They’re not on any of the major television networks, but they have millions of viewers. Now, the Justice Department is alleging that some of the biggest stars in right-wing social media were, unwittingly, part of a sinister Russian operation to influence the 2024 US election.

The personalities weren’t directly named or accused of wrongdoing by the Justice Department, but court documents unsealed Wednesday revealed Russian state media producers funneled nearly $10 million to an unnamed Tennessee-based online media company. The company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media, boasts a slate of high-profile right-wing commentators as “talent,” including Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen, Matt Christiansen and Dave Rubin, collectively boasting millions of followers across social media platforms.

Two Russian state media employees were charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and money laundering.

The secret payments pull back the curtain on some of the most popular right-wing personalities, who were paid millions of dollars by the Kremlin, without their knowledge according to the Justice Department to promote conservative narratives that furthered Russian interests. And while the influencer, podcaster, and online content creator space is booming, the indictment shows how open the new media ecosystem is to infiltration, where independent creators operate with few guardrails and little transparency.

What is Tenet Media?

Tenet Media launched last year, describing itself as “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues” with six commentators, all of whom had established online presences in the conservative media ecosystem.

Some of Tenet’s commentators had careers at more mainstream media outlets prior to striking out on their own: Tim Pool was a reporter at Vice Media and Benny Johnson was a writer at BuzzFeed and the Independent Journal Review (Johnson was let go from both outlets) before becoming MAGA influencers.

Rubin, once known as a libertarian who worked at the progressive network The Young Turks before making a right turn into conservative media, hosts his show “The Rubin Report” on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze and YouTube. Others, like Lauren Southern, have made their name in the online alt-right, White nationalism spaces (Southern has previously denied being a White nationalist).

The commentators assembled by Tenet boasted more than 6 million YouTube subscribers, but their influence has extended well beyond the Google-owned video platform. Pool, known for donning a black beanie on his broadcasts, has used his show to host far-right extremists, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Jack Posobiec. Earlier this year, Pool interviewed former President Donald Trump on his podcast.

Johnson, who boasts nearly 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and is a former chief creative officer of the right-wing activist group Turning Point USA, interviewed Donald Trump Jr. on the Tenet platform in February.

The influencers’ deals with Tenet varied, with the outlet exclusively hosting some of their shows while also cross posting the creators’ other content. According to the indictment, one of the unnamed social media stars was paid $400,000 per month to create videos for the platform, with another unnamed influencer also receiving a $100,000 signing bonus.

Christiansen said during a live stream Wednesday that he was approached last June by Tenet Media co-founders Lauren Chen and her husband, Liam Donovan to join the network, claiming that they could help him get more “eyes” on his content. Neither Chen or Donovan are named in the indictment.

Chen, a right-wing media personality who hosted a show for Glenn Beck’s “The Blaze” and contributed to Turning Point USA, had amassed more than 572,000 subscribers on her YouTube account before it was taken down Thursday. Blaze Media fired Chen the day after the indictment was unsealed by the Justice Department.

Representatives for Tenet did not return a request for comment.

Russian narratives on display

According to the indictment, employees from Russian state media outlet RT allegedly funded and directed the company, hoping to plug in to the commentators’ vast network of fans to exploit divisive narratives that achieved the Kremlin’s goals. Much of the partnership appeared to simply amplify what were already simpatico views between the Kremlin and the company’s influencers. According to intelligence agencies the Kremlin has sought to boost Donald Trump’s candidacy, questioning the West’s support for Ukraine and criticizing elements of the LGBTQ movement.

The Justice Department said the views in the influencer videos promoted Kremlin interests and narratives, including increasing domestic division and aimed “to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine.”

While Russia and the Republican Party under Trump have become increasingly aligned in their views, Russia’s military action in Ukraine became fodder for Tenet’s influencers.

“Ukraine is the enemy of this country!,” Pool yelled on a live stream last month. “Ukraine is our enemy, being funded by the Democrats. I will stress again, one of the greatest enemies of our nation right now is Ukraine.”

In another instance the Russian funders directly asked a Tenet co-founder on or about March 23 to “blame Ukraine and the United States” for a terrorist attack on a concert hall outside of Moscow that killed more than 130 people. While ISIS took responsibility for the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin insinuated Ukraine had a role in the massacre. Kyiv denied any role in the massacre.

“Founder-I responded that Founder-I would ask Commentator-3, and, the next day, confirmed that Commentator-3 said, “he’s happy to cover it,” the indictment stated. The identity of “Commentator-3” is not yet clear.

The day before on March 22, Johnson suggested in a video on his personal channel that Ukraine may be connected to the attack, saying he found it “a little too on the nose for me” for the US to have issued a warning about possible terrorist attacks in the days before the attack took place. It is not clear whether Johnson is “commentator-3” or whether he happened to have already posted a video that fit in with the request. Johnson has denied any knowledge of the Russian funding and has asserted his editorial independence.

In a post on X on Saturday evening, Johnson denied any connection between the request outlined in the indictment and his show. “I never received any request for coverage, never covered this on Tenet and never covered the topic again on any platform,” he said.

Other narratives pushed by the Russian-paid influencers fit in with the Kremlin’s goals, such as fear mongering about migrant gangs and boosting the candidacy of Trump, who US intelligence agencies said Russia supported in the 2020 election.

In 2022, Pool said that while a mass shooting attack on a Colorado LGBTQ nightclub where a man killed five people and injured 19 was “wrong,” he suggested that the club, which had held an “all ages drag brunch” meant it supported “grooming children.”

“We shouldn’t tolerate pedophiles grooming kids,” Pool posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Club Q had a grooming event. How do prevent the violence and stop the grooming?”

The notion that LGBTQpeople are pedophiles or groomers is an extreme homophobic conspiracy theory that is often floated in far-right circles as a justification for anti-LGBTQ policies.

Last November, Rubin attacked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has called Putin a “monster,” after Trudeau urged Israel to show restraint in its military campaign against Hamas following the October 7 attack.

Trudeau is “an evil communist piece of sh–,” Rubin wrote in an X post, who should “just come out of the closet already,” neither statements are true.

The Justice Department said the commentators were not aware that the source of the funding originated with Russia, and at least one of the commentators was told a fake European investor named Eduard Grigoriann was behind the payments.

“In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”

The Tenet influencers who have spoken out since the indictment was unsealed have all said they were unaware of the Russian funding and that they were victims of the scheme.

“Never at any point did anyone other than I have full editorial control of the show and the contents of the show are often apolitical,” Pool said.

At least three of the commentators have publicly stated they were later contacted by the FBI for voluntary interviews as possible victims of a crime.

“Overt shilling”

The Russians also pushed Tenet to promote videos that were going viral on social media, according to the indictment. In one case, Tenet staffers were asked to repost a video of “a well-known U.S. political commentator,” thought to be former Fox News host Tucker Carlson visiting a grocery store in Russia in February, where Carlson fawned over the quality, selection and price of groceries.

“It just feels like overt shilling,” one employee identified as “Producer-1” wrote in an internal chat to one of the company’s founders, according to the indictment.

But the producer eventually acquiesced to pressure from one of Tenet’s founders, responding, “alright I’ll put it out tomorrow,” the indictment said.

“This is why information laundering is so pernicious,” said disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz, a co-founder of the American Sunlight Project. “These folks are after their bottom line, so they post rage bait that will perform well, rake in views and likes, and make their ‘producers’ happy.”

media,White House condemns Tucker Carlson ‘Nazi propaganda’ interview as ‘disgusting and sadistic insult’,2024-09-05,Brian Stelter,"New York CNN —

The Biden administration is denouncing Tucker Carlson after the far-right personality hosted a guest on his show this week who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident, calling the interview “a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans.”

During Carlson’s two-hour sit-down with Darryl Cooper, a podcaster whom he said “may be the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” Cooper claimed that Nazi Germany’s mass murder of Jews was an unintended consequence – something akin to poor planning instead of the methodical extermination that it actually was.

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Cooper claimed, was the “chief villain of the Second World War” and “primarily responsible for that war becoming what it did, becoming something other than an invasion of Poland.”

Carlson’s platforming of Cooper has been widely criticized in recent days, including by some right-wing figures who have defended Carlson in the past. Elon Musk, who promoted the interview on his social media platform, X, calling it “Very interesting. Worth watching,” later deleted his post.

On Thursday the White House added its weight to the matter.

In a statement first shared with CNN, senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said “giving a microphone to a Holocaust denier who spreads Nazi propaganda is a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans, to the memory of the over 6 million Jews who were genocidally murdered by Adolf Hitler, to the service of the millions of Americans who fought to defeat Nazism, and to every subsequent victim of Antisemitism.”

The administration’s statement specifically refuted Cooper’s claim to Carlson that Churchill was the “chief villain” of World War II.

“Hitler was one of the most evil figures in human history and the ‘chief villain’ of World War II, full stop,” Bates wrote. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that trafficking in this moral rot is unacceptable at any time, let alone less than one year after the deadliest massacre perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust and at a time when the cancer of Antisemitism is growing all over the world.”

Reached for comment on Thursday, Carlson sharply criticized the White House.

“The fact that these lunatics have used the Churchill myth to bring our country closer to nuclear war than at any moment in history disgusts me, and should terrify every American,” he said in a text message to CNN. “They’re warmonger freaks. They don’t get the moral high ground.”

But numerous columnists have pointed out inaccuracies in Cooper’s remarks, including his assertion that the Nazis “went in with no plan” for housing millions of prisoners of war “and just threw these people into camps, and millions of people ended up dead there.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, denounced Carlson’s interview with Cooper as “truly revolting.”

“The Nazis’ extensive network of concentration, forced labor, and death camps was part of Hitler’s deliberate plan to exterminate the Jewish people. Inmates didn’t just ‘end up dead’ and they did not ‘surrender,’” he said Wednesday.

In the year and a half since Carlson was fired by Fox News, the former primetime host turned internet vlogger has stoked controversy and garnered embarrassment through his web videos and speaking appearances. On Musk’s X and on his subscription video website, Carlson has interviewed radical figures including Alex Jones and others, offering a big platform to fringe voices and seemingly delighting in the outrage that ensues.

Despite the condemnation, Carlson has continued to be embraced by the Republican Party, which gave him a prime time speaking slot at last month’s party convention in Milwaukee.

Carlson is also undertaking a live speaking tour this fall with events across the country. Donald Trump’s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, is scheduled to appear with Carlson at a Sept. 21 event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a person familiar with the plans told CNN.

Several conservative columnists have raised questions about whether Vance will move forward with the appearance in light of the Cooper controversy. In a statement, the Vance campaign sought to distance the candidate from the interview.

“Senator Vance doesn’t believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture but he obviously does not share the views of the guest interviewed by Tucker Carlson,” Vance campaign spokesperson William Martin told CNN in a statement.

media,New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger sounds the alarm on Trump using authoritarian anti-press ‘playbook’,2024-09-05,Liam Reilly,"New York CNN —

A.G. Sulzberger, the New York Times publisher, sounded the alarm Thursday on the “quiet war” against press freedoms unleashed by authoritarians around the world and said Americans should understand the anti-media “playbook” that Donald Trump might employ in a second term.

In an op-ed published by one of the Times’ main rivals, The Washington Post, Sulzberger warned that Trump and his allies have repeatedly threatened the press and said he wanted the Times “to ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come.”

“My colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote.

The techniques include “sowing public distrust in independent journalism and normalizing the harassment” of journalists to create a “climate hospitable to crackdowns on the media;” using government authorities, like taxation, “to punish offending journalists and news organizations” while rewarding “those who demonstrate fealty to their leadership;” and filing meritless lawsuits and exploiting the courts to make it more costly to report the news.

“The effectiveness of this playbook should not be underestimated,” Sulzberger wrote.

The Times publisher said he didn’t wish to wade into politics, but Trump’s anti-press words and actions – declaring media outlets the “enemy of the people” and suggesting the use of government to quash dissent – must be taken seriously.

“I believe the risk is shared by our entire profession, as well as all who depend on it,” he wrote.

In championing the need for trustworthy news and information, Sulzberger called on his peers to bolster protections, which includes teaching staffers how to protect themselves and their sources, preparing for legal fights and harassment, and pushing back against campaigns that seek to unjustly undermine trust in news media.

Sulzberger occasionally writes essays to prompt journalism industry dialogue about key issues. Last year, he wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about the debate around objectivity in journalism. This year, with Trump’s anti-media rhetoric again front and center, he wanted to write about what an escalating campaign against the American press could look like.

Sulzberger approached it as a summer project of sorts.

“To ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come, my colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote in the essay. “The political and media environments in each country are different, and the campaigns have seen varying tactics and levels of success, but the pattern of anti-press action reveals common threads.”

Sulzberger thought extensively about the best way to publish the essay — whether in the pages of The Times or elsewhere. He wound up placing it with the Post, an unorthodox move given the long history of competition between the two publications. The collaboration makes a clear statement about the importance of solidarity in the face of existential threats to press freedom.

“I’m grateful to The Post for running the piece, especially given the length (and the suspect institutional affiliations of its author,” he wrote in an email to associates on Thursday. “They’ve been a great partner on the cause of press freedom over many decades and it’s great to see that tradition continue.”"

tech,NASA and Nokia are taking 4G into space,2024-04-24,Jack Bantock,"Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think.

That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets.

A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth.

“The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation.

The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.

One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice.

Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.

For NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.

Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.

“Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund.

“Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.”

It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.

NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.

Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.”

“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.

“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”

There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.

If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.

“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said."

Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.”

“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.

“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”

There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.

If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.

“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said."
cars,"The electric car revolution is on track, says IEA",2024-04-23,Hanna Ziady,"London CNN —

Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency.

In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that “surging demand” for EVs over the next decade was set “to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.”

It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs.

The agency’s bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world’s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers.

Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday.

The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

In a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.”

Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats.

In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world’s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States.

Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company’s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China’s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023.

Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.”

In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average.

“Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said.

“Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added.

Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. “China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said.

Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China’s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region’s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW.

EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country.

By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year.

“This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector.

In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States.

Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

tech,AiScout: Top soccer clubs are using a mobile app to find future stars,2024-03-01,Jack Bantock,"London CNN —

A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.

Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.

Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.

The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.

“We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.

“To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’”

It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.

‘It’s more about evolution’

Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas.

Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.

Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.

The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.

Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.

“It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained.

“We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?”

“We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.”

While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.

“You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN."

health,"First on CNN: US faces maternity care crisis, with 1 in 3 counties lacking obstetric doctors to provide care, report warns",2024-09-10,Jacqueline Howard,"The United States is facing an ongoing maternity health crisis in which 1 in every 3 counties does not have a single obstetric clinician, affecting women’s access to care, according to a new report.

The report, released Tuesday by the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes, says that in many parts of the country, obstetrician/gynecologists and family physicians who deliver babies are leaving the workforce, which worsens access to care.

Ob/gyns nationwide delivered more than 85% of babies born in 2022, according to the report, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) now projects that the nation will face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 ob/gyns by 2050.

Additionally, “there’s been a significant uptick in, say, the last five years in terms of hospitals closing their obstetric units, with staff shortages, poor reimbursements, low birth volumes, all of those are influencing the hospital’s decision to close obstetric units and leaving patients with very limited choices about where they can have their delivery,” said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer for March of Dimes.

“We know that, especially following the pandemic, there are many staffing shortages, particularly in nursing,” she said. “And then we have shortages of ob/gyns and family practice doctors and midwives who could be taking on more of the burden.”

Family physicians provide maternity care in some areas where access to ob/gyns is limited or nonexistent, according to the new report. Family physicians account for 1 in 4 obstetric clinicians in rural counties, compared with just 1 in 20 in urban counties, the new report says, and family physicians practicing in rural counties are more likely to report delivering babies than those in urban counties.

The new report also says that the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, continues to affect how and where ob/gyns train and deliver care.

“In states with the most restrictive abortion laws, physicians face severe consequences, including the potential risks of losing their medical licenses and imprisonment for providing abortions, including ones that are medically necessary,” according to the report.

The report added that data from 2021 showed that states where abortion is now prohibited had fewer ob/gyns for every 10,000 births compared with states where abortion rights were upheld.

“In those states that have the strictest abortion bans, there are an increased number of providers who say that it is changing the way that they’re able to take care of their patients,” Williams said.

Where most maternity care deserts are

Overall, more than 35% of US counties are considered “maternity care deserts,” which means there is limited or no access to maternity care there, according to March of Dimes.

In about 1,104 counties, there is no birthing facility or obstetric clinician available to provide care – and these counties are home to more than 2.3 million women of reproductive age.

Women in those counties gave birth to more than 150,000 babies in 2022. But living in a maternity care desert is associated with a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, according to the new report. And about 6 in 10 maternity care deserts are in rural areas.

As more hospitals eliminate obstetric services due to financial challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic and other factors, the number of maternity care deserts in the United States will “steadily become a more dire situation,” ACOG President Dr. Stella Dantas said in an email.

“This is why ACOG, in addition to advocating for improved reimbursement and decreased administrative burdens, has made it a priority to advance policies that support training and education for nonobstetric health care professionals in a variety of settings. Emergency medical services practitioners need to be able to stabilize pregnant and postpartum patients, especially in rural areas with long transport to a facility with obstetric services,” Dantas said.

She added that ACOG is working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal Health Resources and Services Administration to provide resources for medical facilities and practitioners in rural areas to help improve their readiness to identify and manage pregnancy-related emergencies.

Because the Dobbs decision is “likely playing a major role” in the shrinking ob/gyn workforce in many rural areas, Dantas said, “we must also vigorously combat legislative interference in the practice of medicine so that clinicians are free to practice without fear of criminalization and patients are able to get the care they need and deserve in the communities they live and raise their families in.”

‘We can now see the impact’

The states with the highest percentage of maternity care deserts include North Dakota, where 73.6% of counties are maternity care deserts; South Dakota, where 57.6% of counties are maternity deserts; Oklahoma with 51.9%; Missouri with 51.6%; Nebraska with 51.3%; and Arkansas with 50.7%.

The new report says that on average, women giving birth in the United States travel about 16 minutes by car to their nearest birthing hospital without traffic, but that driving time climbs to about 38 minutes for residents in maternity care deserts and about 26 minutes for those living in rural areas.

“What’s different about this report is that we can now see the impact of the maternity care deserts,” Williams said.

“We can see that families who live in maternity care deserts are traveling 2.6 times longer to reach a birthing hospital. They are having a 13% increased risk of preterm birth. If you live in a maternity care desert, you are far less likely to have adequate prenatal care,” she said. “We’re now actually able to see what is the impact, so that whether it’s with policy or programming, we can be even more targeted in knowing that we can make a difference in these areas.”

The March of Dimes report also says that more than half – about 52% – of all US counties do not have a hospital that provides obstetric care. Between 2021 and 2022, about 1 in 25 obstetric units closed nationwide.

In 2022, even though 97.7% of births in the United States happened in hospitals, nearly 6 million women of reproductive age – and 1 in 10 babies born – lived in counties without hospital obstetric services, according to the report.

But the United States has seen an increase in the use of birth centers, which provide maternity care services. A freestanding birth center is a health care facility specifically for childbirth, an option for mothers who want to give birth outside of a hospital setting but not at home. Often, a midwife will lead the patient’s care.

From 2017 to 2022, the number of births that happened within birth centers rose 20%, from 19,878 to 23,945, according to the new report.

However, there are just 416 licensed birth centers spread across 270 counties nationwide, and less than 5% are in rural areas. About 70% of all birth centers are within 10 states: Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

“Birth centers are a way of expanding care for low-risk patients who don’t need a lot of intervention, and those could be leveraged, for example, in communities where there may not be the funding to create an entire hospital or the ability to support a hospital unit, but it could create a birth center that works in conjunction with nearby hospitals,” Williams said.

What’s needed to improve access to care

To improve access to maternity care in the United States, March of Dimes has called for expanded training opportunities to encourage more midwives to join the health care workforce and for investments in telehealth to reach more patients, among other actions.

“We need to expand our ability to take care of patients and low-risk patients really are best taken care of by the experts in physiologic birth, and that is midwifery care,” Williams said.

“Unfortunately, only about 10% of births in the United States are attended by midwives, which is astronomically different from what’s going on in most European countries, where the vast majority of births are attended to by midwives and, of note, there are much lower maternal mortality rates,” she said. In the United States, “we have decreased rates of C-section, decreased rates of preterm birth, if the patients are being taken care of by nurse midwives.”

The findings in the new report are “quite frightening” and reflect what can result from the underfunding of the public health infrastructure in the country, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

“This brings into great clarity the failure of the lack of more concrete health system planning,” Benjamin said.

“And when you look at where these holes in maternity care are in our system, it’s in the same part of our nation that also has inadequate access to health care for health insurance, highest morbidity and mortality for chronic diseases, which is primarily in the South and parts of the midwestern part of the nation,” he said. “We have an enormous lack of health system planning and policies to ensure that people have access to care.”"

health,Women will soon be notified about their breast density after a mammogram. Here’s what that means,2024-09-09,Jacqueline Howard,"Having dense breasts can put women at higher risk of breast cancer and make it more difficult to spot cancer on a mammogram, but many don’t realize it’s a significant risk.

Starting this week, all mammography reports and result letters sent to patients in the United States will be required to include an assessment of breast density. The US Food and Drug Administration’s final rule requiring that mammography facilities notify patients about the density of their breasts goes into effect Tuesday.

Breast density is a measurement of how much fibroglandular tissue there is in a woman’s breast versus fatty tissue. The more fibroglandular tissue, the denser the breast.

About half of women older than 40 in the United States have dense breast tissue, said radiologist Dr. Kimberly Feigin, interim chief of the Breast Imaging Service and head of the Breast Imaging Quality Assurance at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

“We talk about breast density for two reasons. One is that breast density can make it more difficult to spot a cancer on a mammogram, because dense breast tissue – the glandular elements and connective tissue supporting elements – looks white on a mammogram and cancer also looks white on a mammogram,” Feigin said.

In other words, dense breast tissue can hide cancer on a mammogram since the tissue appears white on a mammogram, in the same way lumps and tumors appear.

“The second reason that breast density is important is because having dense breast tissue raises a woman’s level of risk of developing breast cancer,” Feigin said.

The new notification requirements don’t provide specific next steps for patients with dense breasts, but they recommend women talk with their providers to get a clearer sense of their individual risk and to determine a screening plan that’s right for them.

While it is recommended that all women get mammograms starting at age 40, some women with dense breasts may benefit from additional imaging options for breast exams, such as ultrasounds or MRIs.

Breast cancer survivor JoAnn Pushkin, 64, has advocated for more than a decade that there be a national requirement for women to be notified of their breast density. She said the new rule is a long time coming.

In her mid-40s, Pushkin noticed a lump in her breast but wasn’t particularly worried; she’d had a mammogram about eight weeks earlier that was normal.

But she still went back for a diagnostic mammogram, and the radiology technologist told Pushkin, “We didn’t see anything.”

Pushkin thought the technologist had mistaken her for another patient.

“It was a large facility with multiple waiting rooms, and I just assumed that she’d come back into the wrong room,” Pushkin said. “I said, ‘Oh no, I’m the lady with the lump so big I could feel it.’ And she told me, ‘Oh, you have dense breasts. That’s going to be a very hard find for us.’ And I remember sitting back and saying to her, ‘Wait, what?’ I didn’t even know how to make sense of that sentence.”

Even though Pushkin’s mammogram at the time did not reveal the lump that she felt, she did further testing and had an ultrasound performed of her breast.

“And there was the lump, clear as a bell,” Pushkin said. “It was determined to be breast cancer. Within 20 minutes, I learned I had dense breasts, I learned I had breast cancer, and I learned it had been missed because I had dense breasts.”

Pushkin was diagnosed at a later stage of the disease, and she said she underwent eight surgeries and eight rounds of chemo as part of her treatment.

“A few years later, I had a recurrence, and then 30 rounds of radiation. Now I have lymphedema, and all because it was detected at that later stage,” said Pushkin, who has testified before the FDA about breast density and co-created the website DenseBreast-info.org, which features resources on breast density.

“I feel that because I wasn’t told I have dense breasts, I was effectively denied the opportunity for an early-stage diagnosis.”

Standard for all people getting mammograms

So far, an estimated 39 states and the District of Columbia already have required some breast density information to be reported in mammogram result letters to patients, according to a tracker on the DenseBreast-info website. But the language in each state mandate can vary and does not always require providers to notify a patient about their risk, which is why advocates have pushed for a national requirement.

With the new FDA rule in effect, notifying patients about their breast density will be a blanket requirement nationwide.

“This will provide a uniform national standard now so that all women in all states, when they have a mammogram, will be told either that their breasts are dense or that they’re not dense,” said Dr. Wendie Berg, professor of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, who co-founded and serves as chief scientific advisor of DenseBreast-info.org.

The new FDA changes require facilities to provide patients with information about their breast density and include specific language in the mammogram result letter to explain how breast density can influence the accuracy of a mammogram.

An example of a notification statement could be: “Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is dense. In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.”

Or a statement could be: “Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is not dense. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.”

Understanding breast density

There are four categories of breast density provided on a mammogram report, ranging from mostly fatty to extremely dense, Berg said.

With mostly fatty breasts, “it’s very easy to see cancers, and these women are much less likely to develop breast cancer. The next category would be scattered fibroglandular density, which is actually the most common,” Berg said.

“And then heterogeneously dense, which can obscure masses – at least 25% of cancers are going to be missed in that category,” she said. “And then extremely dense would be the last category where at least 40% of cancers are going to be missed. And, if you compare a woman who has extremely dense breasts with someone who has fatty breasts, it’s actually as much as a four times higher risk of developing breast cancer.”

Based on her own family history of breast cancer and her breast density, 10 years ago, Berg said that she determined for herself that she had a 19.7% lifetime risk of developing the disease. Because of this, she insisted to her own physician that she undergo an MRI of her breasts to screen for cancer, instead of having only a 3D mammogram performed.

“The MRI showed a small invasive cancer that you can’t see on my own mammogram,” said Berg, who has since been treated for the disease.

“After that experience, I said, if we’re going to be telling women they have dense breasts, there needs to be a place for women to figure out if they meet criteria for an MRI or if they want to get an ultrasound and what to expect from these tests,” Berg said.

The FDA notes that in some people with dense breast tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers.

“But it doesn’t say any more than that. And then it ends with ‘talk to your healthcare provider,’” Berg said. “The guidelines are not as clear as they could be.”

Many women might not know whether to ask for additional imaging – such as with an MRI – or their doctor may not agree that they need it in some cases. Also for some cases, these options may not be covered by insurance.

“Knowledge is power, and all women can now have informed conversations with their medical providers about the screening plan that’s right for them based on factors influencing their personal breast cancer risk, including breast density,” Molly Guthrie, vice president of policy and advocacy at Susan G. Komen, said in a statement.

“We want everyone to know that dense breast tissue alone doesn’t necessitate additional imaging—it’s just one factor in breast cancer risk,” Guthrie added. “For those who do need imaging beyond a mammogram, out-of-pocket costs are often a barrier. That’s why we’ve been advocating for state and federal legislation to eliminate these expenses. We have the technology to detect breast cancer earlier and save lives, financial barriers shouldn’t stand in the way. It’s crucial for people to understand and have affordable access to the breast imaging they need based on their individual risk.”

Access to quality mammograms

The American Cancer Society has applauded the FDA’s new rule, saying it will reduce delays in diagnosis. It’s estimated that about 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.

“The final rule will improve screening by addressing newer technologies, better enforcement of facility accreditation and quality standards, and enhance the reports that are provided to women and their physicians,” the ACS said in a statement last year.

The ACS said at the time that while the new changes can help reduce breast cancer mortality rates, more work still needs to be done to ensure all women receive access to high quality mammograms.

According to the organization, “Black women are more likely to experience lower quality screening, contributing to the ongoing disparity” in breast cancer mortality among Black and White women.

A study published in 2022 found that the breast cancer death rate dropped by 43% within three decades, from 1989 to 2020, translating to 460,000 fewer breast cancer deaths during that time. When the data were analyzed by race, Black women were found to have a lower incidence rate of breast cancer versus White women, but the death rate was 40% higher in Black women overall.

“Either screening is important or it’s not. And if it’s important, it’s certainly more important for women who we know are at an elevated risk and for whom the mammogram is a compromised tool,” Pushkin said. “Notifying a woman about her beast density gives women the opportunity to advocate for themselves. How can you advocate for yourself in the absence of enough information to know that you need to?”"
health,Women will soon be notified about their breast density after a mammogram. Here’s what that means,2024-09-09,Jacqueline Howard,"Having dense breasts can put women at higher risk of breast cancer and make it more difficult to spot cancer on a mammogram, but many don’t realize it’s a significant risk.

Starting this week, all mammography reports and result letters sent to patients in the United States will be required to include an assessment of breast density. The US Food and Drug Administration’s final rule requiring that mammography facilities notify patients about the density of their breasts goes into effect Tuesday.

Breast density is a measurement of how much fibroglandular tissue there is in a woman’s breast versus fatty tissue. The more fibroglandular tissue, the denser the breast.

About half of women older than 40 in the United States have dense breast tissue, said radiologist Dr. Kimberly Feigin, interim chief of the Breast Imaging Service and head of the Breast Imaging Quality Assurance at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

“We talk about breast density for two reasons. One is that breast density can make it more difficult to spot a cancer on a mammogram, because dense breast tissue – the glandular elements and connective tissue supporting elements – looks white on a mammogram and cancer also looks white on a mammogram,” Feigin said.

In other words, dense breast tissue can hide cancer on a mammogram since the tissue appears white on a mammogram, in the same way lumps and tumors appear.

“The second reason that breast density is important is because having dense breast tissue raises a woman’s level of risk of developing breast cancer,” Feigin said.

The new notification requirements don’t provide specific next steps for patients with dense breasts, but they recommend women talk with their providers to get a clearer sense of their individual risk and to determine a screening plan that’s right for them.

While it is recommended that all women get mammograms starting at age 40, some women with dense breasts may benefit from additional imaging options for breast exams, such as ultrasounds or MRIs.

Breast cancer survivor JoAnn Pushkin, 64, has advocated for more than a decade that there be a national requirement for women to be notified of their breast density. She said the new rule is a long time coming.

In her mid-40s, Pushkin noticed a lump in her breast but wasn’t particularly worried; she’d had a mammogram about eight weeks earlier that was normal.

But she still went back for a diagnostic mammogram, and the radiology technologist told Pushkin, “We didn’t see anything.”

Pushkin thought the technologist had mistaken her for another patient.

“It was a large facility with multiple waiting rooms, and I just assumed that she’d come back into the wrong room,” Pushkin said. “I said, ‘Oh no, I’m the lady with the lump so big I could feel it.’ And she told me, ‘Oh, you have dense breasts. That’s going to be a very hard find for us.’ And I remember sitting back and saying to her, ‘Wait, what?’ I didn’t even know how to make sense of that sentence.”

Even though Pushkin’s mammogram at the time did not reveal the lump that she felt, she did further testing and had an ultrasound performed of her breast.

“And there was the lump, clear as a bell,” Pushkin said. “It was determined to be breast cancer. Within 20 minutes, I learned I had dense breasts, I learned I had breast cancer, and I learned it had been missed because I had dense breasts.”

Pushkin was diagnosed at a later stage of the disease, and she said she underwent eight surgeries and eight rounds of chemo as part of her treatment.

“A few years later, I had a recurrence, and then 30 rounds of radiation. Now I have lymphedema, and all because it was detected at that later stage,” said Pushkin, who has testified before the FDA about breast density and co-created the website DenseBreast-info.org, which features resources on breast density.

“I feel that because I wasn’t told I have dense breasts, I was effectively denied the opportunity for an early-stage diagnosis.”

Standard for all people getting mammograms

So far, an estimated 39 states and the District of Columbia already have required some breast density information to be reported in mammogram result letters to patients, according to a tracker on the DenseBreast-info website. But the language in each state mandate can vary and does not always require providers to notify a patient about their risk, which is why advocates have pushed for a national requirement.

With the new FDA rule in effect, notifying patients about their breast density will be a blanket requirement nationwide.

“This will provide a uniform national standard now so that all women in all states, when they have a mammogram, will be told either that their breasts are dense or that they’re not dense,” said Dr. Wendie Berg, professor of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, who co-founded and serves as chief scientific advisor of DenseBreast-info.org.

CNN —

The pandemic’s effects on teenagers were profound — numerous studies have documented reports of issues with their mental health, social lives and more.

Now, a new study suggests those phenomena caused some adolescents’ brains to age much faster than they normally would — 4.2 years faster in girls and 1.4 years faster in boys on average, according to the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

By being the first to contribute details on aging differences by sex, the study adds to the existing body of knowledge provided by two previous studies on the Covid-19 pandemic and accelerated brain aging among adolescents.

“The findings are an important wake-up call about the fragility of the teenage brain,” said senior study author Dr. Patricia K. Kuhl, the Bezos Family Foundation Endowed Chair in Early Childhood Learning and codirector of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, via email. “Teens need our support now more than ever.”

Significant socioemotional development occurs during adolescence, along with substantial changes to brain structure and function. The thickness of the cerebral cortex naturally peaks during childhood, steadily decreases throughout adolescence and continues to decrease through one’s lifespan, the authors wrote.

The researchers originally intended to track ordinary adolescent brain development over time, starting with MRIs the authors conducted on participants’ brains in 2018. They planned to follow up with them for another scan in 2020.

The pandemic delayed the second MRI by three to four years — when the 130 participants based in Washington state were between ages 12 and 20. The authors excluded adolescents who had been diagnosed with a developmental or psychiatric disorder or who were taking psychotropic medications.

The team used the pre-pandemic MRI data to create a “normative model” of how 68 regions of the brain would likely develop over typical adolescence, to which they could compare the post-pandemic MRI data and see if it deviated from expectations. This normative model is analogous to the normative growth charts used in pediatric offices to track height and weight in young children, the authors said. It has also been used by other researchers to study the effects of circumstances or conditions such as socioeconomic disadvantage, autism, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or traumatic stress.

The study revealed accelerated cortical thinning in the post-pandemic brains of teens — occurring in 30 brain regions across both hemispheres and all lobes for girls, and in only two regions for boys. The prevalence of the thinning amounted to 43% and 6% of the studied brain regions for girls and boys, respectively.

The study “is not a major revelation, as the authors acknowledge,” but does add to our knowledge of the subject, said Dr. Max Wiznitzer, professor of pediatrics and neurology at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, via email. Wiznitzer wasn’t involved in the research.

How adversity influences the brain

The study has a few important limitations, including that senior author Kuhl contributed the study to the journal, meaning that she was also an editor of the study and able to choose, with restrictions, who peer-reviewed it.

And since everyone was affected by the pandemic, the authors didn’t have a control group, which is why they had to use normative modeling to approximate what the normal controls would have been, Wiznitzer said — “which is not as good as true controls but likely the best they can do.”

The authors also didn’t have data on participants’ families’ jobs, financial or food security or on participants’ exercise, sleep or dietary habits, they said. It’s also unknown whether the participants possibly having had Covid-19 could have contributed to the findings.

“Theirs is a good study, but even then it probably doesn’t have a large enough sample to say that the sex difference in brain aging is a reliable finding,” said Dr. Ian Gotlib, author of a 2022 study on the subject and director of the Stanford Neurodevelopment, Affect, and Psychopathology Laboratory at Stanford University, via email.

However, “after reading this paper we examined sex differences in the data we used in our study — same direction of sex differences as the authors reported, but not statistically significant with our slightly smaller sample,” added Gotlib, who wasn’t involved in the study.

The regions with the most acceleration in thinning among girls have been linked to social cognitive functions, such as recognizing and processing faces and expressions; processing social and emotional experiences; the ability to have empathy and compassion; and language comprehension, according to the study. The regions affected in boys’ brains are involved in processing objects in the visual field as well as faces.

Based on previous research, the authors think the findings may be due to a phenomenon known as the “stress acceleration hypothesis.” This hypothesis posits that in a high-stress environment, development may shift toward maturing earlier to protect the brain’s emotional circuits and regions involved in learning and memory — reducing the harm of adversity on structural development.

There have also been reports of correlations between saliva cortisol levels and cortical thickness in the frontal lobe among human adults. Sex differences could be due to the varying effects of stressors on boys versus girls based on what’s important to each, the authors said.

What you can do

Another factor the researchers don’t yet know is whether these effects on the brain are permanent, Kuhl said.

“The brain does not recover and get thicker, we know that, but one measure of whether the teens show recovery after the pandemic is over and social normalcy has completely returned, is whether their brains thin more slowly,” Kuhl added. “If that was the case, we could say that teens’ brains showed some recovery. That’s a study we can actually do in the future.”

Ensuring young people are supported in their mental health is critical, Gotlib said. Encourage in-person quality time, limit social media use and watch for behavioral changes reflecting a shift in mental health or mood so you can intervene as early as possible, Wiznitzer said.

It’s important to recognize that although the “pandemic is largely over,” its effects remain, Gotlib said.

“A total return to ‘normal’ may never occur,” Kuhl said via email. “These are all potent reminders of human fragility and of the importance of investing in the science of prevention and preparation for the next (inevitable) pandemic.”"

health,US’ first human case of bird flu not linked to animals reported in Missouri,2024-09-06,Carma Hassan,"A person in Missouri is the United States’ first case of H5 avian influenza without a known exposure to a sick animal, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

“This is the 14th human case of H5 reported in the United States during 2024 and the first case of H5 without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals,” the CDC said in a statement. It’s also the first H5 case detected through the country’s national flu surveillance system rather than targeted surveillance of the ongoing bird flu outbreak in animals.

The case is under investigation by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The person had underlying medical conditions and was hospitalized on August 22. The person tested positive for influenza A, was treated with influenza antiviral medications and is now recovered and at home, according to MDHSS.

A sample from the patient was sent to the CDC, which confirmed that the case was a type of bird flu. Flu viruses are classified based on two proteins that sit on the surface of the virus an H, or hemagglutinin, protein, and an N, or neuraminidase, protein. A spokesperson for the CDC said the agency had confirmed the flu type is H5, but has not yet determined the N type. They are working on isolating the virus and reading its genetic sequence. Scientists at the CDC hope to have more information on the genetics of the virus in the coming days, the spokesperson said.

Knowing the genetic sequence will tell researchers how closely the virus that infected this patient may be related to the viruses that currently causing outbreaks in chickens, and cows and other mammals in the US.

There are no cases of bird flu among cattle in Missouri, but there have been outbreaks of the virus among poultry in the state.

The CDC’s risk assessment of H5N1 for the general public remains low, the agency said.

health,White House announces rule that would cut insurance red tape over mental health and substance use disorder care,2024-09-09,"Carma Hassan, Jamie Gumbrecht","The Biden administration announced a final rule on Monday meant to expand access and lower costs for care for mental health and substance use disorders. Most provisions in the rule will apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers for plan years starting January 1 or after.

Under this rule, mental health and substance use disorder care on private insurance plans should be covered at the same level as physical health benefits. That may mean “adding more mental health and substance use professionals to their networks or reducing red tape for providers to deliver care,” according to a White House fact sheet shared with CNN ahead of Monday’s announcement.

“Mental health care is health care. But for far too many Americans, critical care and treatments are out of reach. Today, my Administration is taking action to address our nation’s mental health crisis by ensuring mental health coverage will be covered at the same level as other health care for Americans. There is no reason that breaking your arm should be treated differently than having a mental health condition,” President Joe Biden said in a statement.

The rule reinforces the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, known as MHPAEA, a 2008 federal law that requires that insurance plans that cover mental health do so at the same level as physical health. Despite the law, insurers have often made it difficult for people to access in-network mental health care, White House Domestic Policy Adviser Neera Tanden said during a briefing. Instead, people have still paid high costs for mental health care, often needing to go out of network and pay out of pocket.

The rule instructs insurers to evaluate coverage based on several criteria, including the plan’s provider network, how much plans pay for out-of-network coverage and how often prior authorization is required and approved under existing plans, according to the administration.

“No one should have to drain their savings or go into debt to get help for themselves or their loved ones,” Tanden said, adding that the change could help 175 million people with private insurance access care using their own plans.

The final rule will also close a loophole that exempted federally provided health insurance plans from complying with the MHPAEA — a move that requires more than 200 additional health plans to improve mental health care for 120,000 consumers, the administration estimates.

Tanden emphasized that access to mental health care is “crucial for the well-being of our families.”

“As you all know, mental challenges touch every corner of the country. As many as two in five American adults have anxiety or depression. Tragically, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people at ages 10 to 24 years old,” Tanden said, calling the numbers “unacceptable.”

Enforcement of the rule will fall to the departments of Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services, administration official have said.

“For too long, workers have faced unnecessary hurdles in accessing mental health and substance use disorder treatment – barriers that can mean the difference between life and death. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to tearing down these walls, ensuring that every worker has equal access to the care they need to thrive, both physically and mentally,” Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su said in a statement.

Still, the law doesn’t require employers to offer mental health benefits to employees. The ERISA Industry Committee, a major employer group known as ERIC, had said some of the proposed changes were “so burdensome that many of our members will have no other choice but to re-think the type and level of their plans’ coverage.”

Melissa Bartlett, senior vice president of health policy for ERIC, said in a statement Monday that the final rule incorporated some stakeholder feedback but “adds complexity” for employers offering behavioral health benefits.

“As ERIC evaluates this rule and assesses the implications for its member companies, we will consider all possibilities to prevent further harm to employers offering behavioral health benefits, and the employees and families who count on them – up to and including litigation,” Bartlett said.

In a joint statement, the Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and ERIC said the rule would have “unintended consequences” that could raise costs and jeopardize access to mental health care. Addressing the shortage of mental health providers is a top priority, the groups said, but “the final rule will complicate compliance so much that it will be impossible to operationalize, resulting in worse patient outcomes.”

Biden administration officials said the final rule provides clarity for insurers about their obligations and departments will assist plans to bring them into compliance. It noted that some provisions won’t apply until January 2026.

“Health care, whether for physical or behavioral conditions, is health care. No one should receive lesser care for one or the other,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “That’s the law. The rules we issue today make that clear.”

health,White House announces rule that would cut insurance red tape over mental health and substance use disorder care,2024-09-09,"Carma Hassan, Jamie Gumbrecht","The Biden administration announced a final rule on Monday meant to expand access and lower costs for care for mental health and substance use disorders. Most provisions in the rule will apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers for plan years starting January 1 or after.

Under this rule, mental health and substance use disorder care on private insurance plans should be covered at the same level as physical health benefits. That may mean “adding more mental health and substance use professionals to their networks or reducing red tape for providers to deliver care,” according to a White House fact sheet shared with CNN ahead of Monday’s announcement.

“Mental health care is health care. But for far too many Americans, critical care and treatments are out of reach. Today, my Administration is taking action to address our nation’s mental health crisis by ensuring mental health coverage will be covered at the same level as other health care for Americans. There is no reason that breaking your arm should be treated differently than having a mental health condition,” President Joe Biden said in a statement.

The rule reinforces the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, known as MHPAEA, a 2008 federal law that requires that insurance plans that cover mental health do so at the same level as physical health. Despite the law, insurers have often made it difficult for people to access in-network mental health care, White House Domestic Policy Adviser Neera Tanden said during a briefing. Instead, people have still paid high costs for mental health care, often needing to go out of network and pay out of pocket.

The rule instructs insurers to evaluate coverage based on several criteria, including the plan’s provider network, how much plans pay for out-of-network coverage and how often prior authorization is required and approved under existing plans, according to the administration.

“No one should have to drain their savings or go into debt to get help for themselves or their loved ones,” Tanden said, adding that the change could help 175 million people with private insurance access care using their own plans.

The final rule will also close a loophole that exempted federally provided health insurance plans from complying with the MHPAEA — a move that requires more than 200 additional health plans to improve mental health care for 120,000 consumers, the administration estimates.

Tanden emphasized that access to mental health care is “crucial for the well-being of our families.”

Arsenic occurs naturally in the environment and can combine with other materials to create organic or inorganic forms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Organic arsenic compounds mainly appear in fish and shellfish, and exposure is less harmful to humans.

Inorganic compounds are found in soil, sediments and groundwater. Exposure may lead to irritation of the stomach or intestines, blood vessel damage, skin changes and reduced nerve function. Long-term exposure in children has also been linked with lower IQ scores.

The FDA set the 10 ppb limit for inorganic arsenic in apple juice in June 2023 in an effort to reduce exposure of babies and young children to environmental contaminants through food. However, that level was not a requirement for manufacturers, and the agency said at the time that it would consider the limit “in addition to other factors” when deciding to take action on arsenic levels in foods.

health,National Suicide Prevention Month: How to reduce suicide risk,2024-09-04,Kristen Rogers,"Editor’s Note: Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.

In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.

CNN —

More than 49,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2022 — that’s one death every 11 minutes, and more than any other year dating to back at least 1941, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On top of that, 13.2 million people seriously considered suicide, 3.8 million planned it and 1.6 million attempted suicide.

Though rates among 10- to 24-year-olds in the US have declined, these stats are a glaring reminder that “the silent epidemic of suicide” isn’t over, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association.

The nation “still has some of the highest rates of suicidal attempts in the developed world, and the number of suicides, at least half using firearms, is still remarkably high,” Prinstein, the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said via email.

That’s why this National Suicide Prevention Month and always, being informed about suicide and knowing that you don’t need to be a mental health provider to lower your risk of suicide or support your loved ones is as important as ever, said Dr. Justin Baker, clinical director of the Suicide and Trauma Reduction Initiative for Veterans, or STRIVE, at the Ohio State University.

Globally, more than 720,000 people die by suicide yearly, and it’s the third leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds.

That means parents need to have the “suicide talk” with their teens just like they have conversations about sex and drugs, Prinstein said.

“There are simple, proven steps everyone can take to lower their risk and the risk of family and friends from dying by suicide,” Baker, also assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at the Ohio State University, said via email.

Knowing these five things about suicide can help.

1. Sometimes there are warning signs

Mental health professionals and researchers still haven’t nailed down how to totally predict with certainty who’s at risk for attempting suicide, and whether or when vulnerable people will do it, experts said.

That’s because stressors that could lead to suicide for some people don’t have the same impact on others. Also, there isn’t always a long time frame during which someone is suicidal and acting in ways that signal the need for help.

But there are some situations in which someone who’s suicidal and planning for a longer period will show behavioral or emotional changes. Those changes, as well as other risk factors, can include the following:

● Unusual behavior with potentially lethal items such as firearms or pills

● Giving away cherished belongings

● Excessive or insufficient sleep

● Withdrawing or isolating oneself

● Getting highly intoxicated or driving recklessly

● Talking about wanting to die, via suicide or otherwise

● Struggling to come up with reasons to live

● Feeling like a burden, unneeded or as if they don’t belong anywhere or with anyone

● Feeling hopeless

● Substance abuse issues

● A history of trauma

● Experiencing mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and personality disorders, especially if not receiving treatment

● Personal or family history of suicide

● Easy access to potentially fatal means

● Loss of interest in activities or school

2. Not everyone who attempts suicide has a mental health condition

One of many common myths about suicide is that only people with mental health conditions have suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide.

That’s not always true. Many people who attempt or die by suicide don’t fit criteria for mental health disorders, clinical psychologist Dr. Michael Roeske told CNN in a previous story — rather, they likely don’t see a way to live with an incredibly stressful situation such as loss of a job, home or loved one; infidelity; trauma; legal matters; a debilitating illness; or other crises.

3. There are ways you can help

If your loved one seems to be at risk of suicide, be supportive and intentional about asking them what’s going on, experts said. They recommend a narrative, person-centered approach — such as asking an open-ended question like, “Hey, I’ve noticed life’s gotten overwhelming these past couple days. Do you want to tell me about it?”

Listen, express appreciation for their openness and offer to help figure it out together, without giving unsolicited advice or encouragement about all the wonderful reasons they should stay alive — sometimes that can make them feel lonelier. But if your loved one seems more urgently at risk or in the process of attempting suicide, get medical care or call 911. You can also call 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline to speak with trained counselors who can help you or someone you know work through suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

If you’re the one struggling with suicidal thoughts, seek professional help and talk with someone you trust. Therapy and certain psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants, can also help.

Additionally, “developing a crisis response plan, a plan people make to identify coping strategies they can use in a crisis, can significantly reduce the risk of a suicide attempt,” Baker said.

4. People who attempt suicide aren’t selfish

Some people think suicide is selfish, but this characterization is misguided and derogatory, experts said, since people who attempt or die by suicide often desire to end their pain or see themselves as burdensome. Many don’t see any other choice.

Therefore, “nearsighted” may be a better term since their focus becomes limited to what’s immediately in front of them, rendering them unable to see the bigger picture of their past, present and future, Roeske said.

5. How you talk about suicide matters

Not treating the topic of suicide as the elephant in the room is an important step in reducing the stigma that keeps some people from getting help. But what you say and how you say it also matter.

That’s why many mental health experts, medical institutions, media and more have moved away from saying certain harmful phrases — including “committed suicide,” which implies criminality and can cast a moral judgment, Dr. Jacek Debiec, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, told CNN in a previous story.

Describing a suicide attempt as “successful” is also problematic, as taking one’s life is not a positive achievement. “Failed suicide attempt” can suggest that surviving isn’t the best outcome or that there’s something lacking in the character or willpower of the attempter. Given these factors, when referring to suicide, appropriate language includes “died by suicide,” “fatal suicide attempt,” “killed herself” or “took his own life,” experts said.

Acceptable shorthand ways to communicate not dying from an attempt include “nonfatal suicide attempt” or simply “suicide attempt.”

Using more compassionate language to discuss suicide can also improve empathy and strategies for reducing suicide risk, experts said."
health,"The dangers of energy drinks and how much caffeine you should consume, according to a doctor",2024-09-09,Katia Hetter,"It is possible to drink too much caffeine, as actor Dakota Johnson recently found out after she had lots of caffeine-infused energy drinks while directing her first movie and found herself feeling jittery and having trouble sleeping.

Johnson, who was making her directorial debut in the short film “Loser Baby,” thought her energy drink was a “natural drink.” She told Variety she didn’t realize that “I was basically overdosing on caffeine.”

Many people may be confused. They may think of energy drinks as sports drinks or consider them appropriate for hydration, including for children. So, what exactly are energy drinks? Given that a major concern is the caffeine quantity in them, what is an appropriate amount of caffeine to consume? How much is too much — is it possible to overdose on caffeine? Should people use energy drinks before sports activities? Who should be especially careful of these drinks? And are there better ways to reduce fatigue and boost energy?

To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner and is the mother of two school-age children.

CNN: What exactly are energy drinks?

Dr. Leana Wen: While there is no standard definition of energy drinks, typically these are drinks marketed to increase attention, alertness and energy. They often contain large amounts of caffeine as well as sugar and legal stimulants, including taurine, guarana and L-carnitine.

CNN: Are energy drinks the same thing as sports drinks?

Wen: No, they are not, and it’s really important that people distinguish between the two.

Sports drinks are beverages that contain electrolytes. They are used by athletes and other people who are losing water and electrolytes during heavy exercise and sweating. Some contain just salts and electrolytes, and others will have added sugars.

Energy drinks may also contain some electrolytes and added sugars, but their main purpose is to serve as a stimulant. They should not be used to replace electrolytes and fluids lost during exercise.

CNN: Can drinking a lot of energy drinks be dangerous?

Wen: Yes, especially because of excessive caffeine consumption.

A large amount of caffeine can cause rapid heartbeat. People can become jittery and anxious. They may have trouble sleeping, which paradoxically causes more fatigue over time. Those who consume energy drinks thinking that they replenish electrolytes and fluids may become dehydrated, especially as caffeine is a diuretic that promotes fluid loss.

A very large amount of caffeine consumption can lead to caffeine intoxication. This is uncommon but can be dangerous, even life-threatening, especially when the heart rhythm is disrupted. Individuals could suffer cardiac arrest as well as other severe symptoms such as brain swelling and kidney failure.

CNN: How much caffeine does someone need to consume for it to be dangerous?

Wen: More than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily is considered excessive for most adults, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This is the equivalent amount of four or five cups of coffee.

Someone drinking 400 milligrams of caffeine is unlikely to have the severe effects of caffeine intoxication, but they could certainly experience jitteriness and sleep disruption.

Some energy drinks can contain as much as 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine in each bottle or can. It’s really important to look carefully at the label before consuming.

CNN: Is this recommendation different for children?

Wen: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children and adolescents do not consume energy drinks. They also recommend against consumption of drinks that contain caffeine and added sugar, citing that drinking such beverages can increase the risk of anxiety, hyperactivity and even excessive weight gain, heart disease and fatty liver disease.

However, 30% to 50% of adolescents report consuming energy drinks. And energy drinks are sold sometimes in school vending machines.

Parents should be really careful to look at the label of each drink that their kids are drinking. Some drinks look similar but actually contain very different amounts of caffeine.

CNN: Should people use energy drinks before sports activities?

Wen: In general, no. Water is the best form of hydration for most people. Those concerned about electrolyte loss, such as endurance athletes and people who have to work outdoors in hot weather, should consider sports drinks — not energy drinks.

There may be some adults who use energy drinks as a performance enhancer. They should use drinks for this purpose knowing the amount of caffeine they are using as well as the fact that there are other stimulants in their drink.

CNN: Who are individuals who should be especially careful of energy drinks?

Wen: We discussed children, who really should not be using any energy drinks. Other people who should be cautious include those with chronic heart problems or high blood pressure since caffeine and other stimulants in the energy drinks could increase heart rate and blood pressure. Those who already have abnormal heart rhythms or who have a propensity for developing them should stay away, as should those who have chronic kidney problems.

Caffeine can also interfere with certain medications, including some anti-depressants, seizure medications and diabetes medications. People who have underlying medical conditions and who are on prescription medications should check with their primary care provider about energy drink use.

CNN: Are there other better ways to reduce fatigue and boost energy?

Wen: Yes, there are much better ways. Energy drinks may offer a quick energy boost, but they have potential risks and are not a good long-term solution.

If you are suffering from ongoing exhaustion, it’s important to understand why. Make sure there aren’t underlying medical issues, such as anemia, hypothyroidism or sleep apnea. Take a look at your sleep schedule and see if changing some sleep habits could help. A change to your diet may also give you more energy, as could adding in physical activity.

And be sure to keep well-hydrated; something simple like drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day could help you more than an energy drink, and without the risk that comes from consuming excessive amounts of stimulants."
health,Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else,2024-09-07,Annette Choi,"Guns continue to be the leading cause of death for US children and teens since surpassing car accidents in 2020.

Firearms accounted for 18% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2022, the most recent data available from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. About 3,500 children died in gun-related incidents that year. That’s about five children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis.

The shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, on Wednesday marks the 45th school shooting in 2024. Two students and two teachers were killed. It’s the deadliest school shooting since the March 2023 massacre at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee."
health,Mental health jobs to grow 3 times the rate of all US jobs over next decade,2024-09-07,"Amy O Kruk, Rachel Wilson","As the demand for mental health care grows across the United States, so will an expected demand for service providers.

Employment growth in the mental health field — for psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, counselors, psychiatric aides and social workers — is expected to be triple the projection for a typical US job, according to a CNN analysis of new data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

A subset of mental health practitioners — specifically mental health counselors, which include substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors — is projected to grow even more rapidly. Growth for these roles is set to increase by 19%, going from about 450,000 workers in 2023 to 534,000 by 2033, making it among the top 20 fastest-growing US occupations. These counselors work with people seeking help for problems such as anxiety, addictions and stress.

Marriage and family therapists are other jobs within the mental health field expected to show notable growth by 2033, with jobs there expected to rise by 16%. And the BLS group “counselors, all other,” a catch-all category that includes jobs such as sexual assault counselors and anger control or grief counselors, is similarly projected to grow 14% by 2033.

Why and where growth is likely

Two factors could be increasing demand for mental health services: Decreasing stigma around seeking treatment and increasing uncertainty in peoples’ lives, said Traci Cipriano, a clinical psychologist and assistant clinical professor in the Yale School of Medicine. She told CNN that political divisiveness, economic uncertainty, gun violence and the climate crisis are factors putting particular pressure on Americans.

“All of these things feel threatening to a certain degree, but each one of us as an individual really has very little control over them,” Cipriano said. “Stress itself can be managed through mental health treatment but if you don’t manage it, it can lead to depression and anxiety.”

Over the next decade, more Americans are also expected to manage stress outside of formal therapy. CNN’s analysis of BLS job projections also found that holistic workers — such as acupuncturists, fitness trainers and massage therapists — are also set to outpace typical job growth.

Employment growth specifically for massage therapists is estimated to balloon by nearly 18% by 2033, adding almost 23,000 jobs annually on average. More than half of clients cited relaxation or stress relief as the primary reason for receiving a massage, according to a 2023 survey by the American Massage Therapy Association.

Access among top barriers to seeking treatment

The growing demand for mental health workers is one sign of shortages amid what many are calling a health emergency. Nine out of 10 adults said they believed that there’s a mental health crisis in the United States, and young people especially reported deteriorated well-being during and after the pandemic.

While more adults are seeking treatment in recent years, most struggling with their mental health still do not receive support.

One reason could be the approximately 122 million Americans who live in areas where there is a scarcity of mental health professionals, according to a 2021 analysis by USA Facts. Rural areas are particularly vulnerable, with Wyoming and Utah leading for the highest proportion of people without access to mental health providers.

“We’re experiencing a shortage of mental health professionals,” said Cipriano. “People can’t get in and access the treatment they need, so it makes sense there would be a need for job growth.”

Methodology

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects employment projection data for more than 1,100 detailed occupational groups. These group employment categories can represent multiple professions. For example, the occupational group “Therapists, all other” includes art and music therapists but also peripatologists – people who support those who are visually impaired to travel independently. As such, some of the group employment categories analyzed by CNN may include professions not directly connected to mental health services and similarly, some occupational groups omitted from our analysis may include mental health-related jobs.

To identify mental health professionals as specifically as possible, CNN limited its analysis to occupations in the categories of psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, counselors, psychiatric aides and social workers. We included the following employment categories (national employment code in parentheses): Substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors (21-1018); counselors, all other (21-1019); marriage and family therapists (21-1013); therapists, all other (29-1129); mental health and substance abuse social workers (21-1023); clinical and counseling psychologists (19-3033); school psychologists (19-3034); psychologists, all other (19-3039); psychiatrists (29-1223); and psychiatric aides (31-1133).

For holistic workers, CNN included massage therapists (31-9011); exercise trainers and group fitness instructors (39-9031); dietitians and nutritionists (29-1031); acupuncturists (29-1291); and healthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners, all other (29-1299).

While there are limitations to this analysis because of the broad nature of the BLS’s occupational groups, its purpose is to examine high-level employment trends."

And when she had to get rid of her favorite pair of jean shorts, the ones she wore for years, she felt bad for the clothing as she folded it to be sent away.

It’s nothing that impacts Wilde’s ability to function, she said, just a fleeting moment of emotion for the object that cannot return the feeling. When Wilde talked about the phenomenon in a video on her TikTok account, where she often posts lifestyle and relationship content, she found that she was not the only one who did it. People commented that they felt emotions for their stuffed animals, plants, furniture and even the voice behind their phone’s GPS.

The brief humanizing of these non-sentient objects could be a part of a person’s natural desire to seek out connections in their everyday lives, said Dr. Melissa Shepard, a board-certified psychiatrist in Maryland.

“We’re sort of hardwired to connect with other people, and sometimes that extends to other (things) who aren’t people,” Shepard said. “We look for ways as humans to make sense of the world, and one of the easiest ways to understand the world is through what your own experiences are.”

It’s nothing to be concerned about unless it is an extreme emotion that interferes with your daily life. Here’s what experts have to say about the curious behavior.

Anthropomorphizing household objects

When people feel sympathy for inanimate objects, they are anthropomorphizing, attributing human behaviors or feelings to animals or objects who cannot feel the same emotions as we do, Shepard said.

The exact reason people do this is unclear, but experts have some guesses. Sometimes, the feelings are attached to objects that a person has had for a while and now finds to be sentimental or nostalgic, reminding them of a different time in their life, said Kim Egel, a licensed marriage and family therapist in California.

“I think we all have things that kind of tug at our hearts a little bit more,” Egel said. “It’s common for humans to do this. … Perhaps just some people might do it more than others for certain reasons.”

It could be a projection of someone’s feelings onto the object, such as giving an object an emotion that they have felt in the past, like loneliness when said object is isolated. Or it could be a sign that a person is not getting the connection that they want and need from humans, she added.

When Wilde first shared the video, she thought she might be the only one who experienced emotions for the unassuming objects, she said.

“My husband, who’s in the video with me, he doesn’t get it at all. He’s like, ‘I don’t understand how you could feel any kind of human feeling toward something that isn’t human or alive,’” Wilde said. “But it’s not at the same level that you feel it for a human, it’s just a comparable emotion.

“It’s not like it affects my day-to-day, like I think about it quickly, that I feel bad for the jean shorts, and then it’s over. … You realize, ‘why am I feeling sad for this? These are, you know, jean shorts,’ and you move on from it.”

She wonders if the feelings could be derived from the movies she loved to watch as a kid, such as Disney’s “Toy Story” saga or “Beauty and the Beast,” which gives life to things that do not have it in the real world. Or maybe it stems from feelings she had as a kid of being left out or not included that she doesn’t want anyone else to feel, she said.

Wilde wonders if anthropomorphizing is more common for people that watched movies like ""Toy Story"" as a kid, which gives life to things that do not have it in the real world. Snap/Shutterstock

“I guess sometimes I wonder if I feel like I’m the squeaky wheel cart, you know, like maybe someone hasn’t looked out for me – not to sound so dramatic,” Wilde said. “I wonder if I have this need to make sure no one feels left behind… so then that translates to the banana left alone on the counter.”

There is a medical condition known as delusional companion syndrome where people can have these feelings of empathy to a much more extreme extent and can be convinced that the objects do have these emotions — but it is much less common than the average anthropomorphizing, Shepard said. Anthropomorphizing is also something Shepard has more commonly noticed in her neurodivergent patients, who often have the feelings more intensely to where it can cause disruptions in life, she added.

If someone finds themselves anthropomorphizing to a point where they avoid certain activities that cause the feelings, or they are unable to throw stuff out due to the intense emotion, Shepard recommends contacting a mental health professional.

Most of the time, “it is something that’s normal for people to do, and oftentimes, can be a sign that you maybe have a really healthy imagination… and a sign that you can empathize with people more easily,” Shepard said. “It is also a really beautiful thing, because I think it allows us to connect with people and objects and things in ways that we wouldn’t otherwise.”

Feeling sympathy for robots and AI

Robots sometimes gain human sympathy as well, such as the common anthropomorphizing of the NASA Mars rovers. In August 2013, one year after its successful launch, the Curiosity rover sang itself happy birthday, and was quickly dubbed the loneliest birthday in the galaxy. In February 2019, when the Opportunity rover was declared dead – its final message to the space station in June 2018 translated to “My battery is low and it’s getting dark” — social media users responded to the announcement with their expressions of grief for the space robot.

As artificial intelligence, or AI, becomes more integrated into everyday life, research is looking into whether the chatbot can also cause people to feel similar emotions that are felt for other humans, said Dr. Marlynn Wei, a psychiatrist and founder of a holistic psychotherapy practice in New York. Typically, if robots have more human-like features, such as a face, voice, personality or human body language, people are more likely to empathize with it, she added.

But on the other end, if robots are too perfectly human-like, it creates the opposite effect known as the uncanny valley. This phenomenon is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling in reaction to CGI animation or nonhuman machines, such as a robot with human-like eyes, said Wei, who also has a performance project five years in the works called “Elixir: Digital Im­mortality,” which explores people’s reactions to AI clones of themselves or loved ones.

These AI companions are becoming increasingly popular, but experts don’t yet know how these bots can affect someone’s development or psychology, Wei said. “We’re solving our loneliness problem by giving people AI companions, but is that actually a good thing? Is that artificial intimacy really something that we want to solve this issue of loneliness? Is it actually a healthy social connection? We’re still trying to learn how (AI) impacts us on a daily basis.”"
health,Valley fever at Lightning in a Bottle festival: officials warn,2024-09-06,Carma Hassan,"After nearly 20 cases of Valley fever were identified after a summer music festival in California, state health officials are warning that risk from the fungal infection rises in the late summer and early fall.

“We’re preparing for another possible increase in Valley fever cases in the coming months, and we want Californians to know the signs and symptoms to detect it early,” said Dr. Tomás Aragón, the California Department of Public Health director and state public health officer. “If you have a lingering cough and fatigue, please talk to a doctor about Valley fever, especially if you’ve been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions.”

People and pets can get the infection by breathing in fungal spores in dust from the outdoors containing the Valley fever fungus, according to the California Department of Public Health. The infection primarily occurs in the southwestern US and some parts of Washington state, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Valley fever, also known as coccidioidomycosis, is not contagious and cannot spread person-to-person. It can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms, such as cough and chest pain, headache and tiredness. The illness can linger for at least a month.

In rare cases, the infection can spread from the lungs to the brain and spinal cord, the skin or the bones and joints, the CDC said.

Health-care providers can test for the disease through a blood sample or a skin test.

The number of infections is growing in California, with at least 9,000 cases reported across the state in 2023 and more than 5,000 preliminary cases reported so far in 2024 as of July 1, the state health department said.

More than a dozen cases of Valley fever were reported among people who attended or worked at the Lightning in a Bottle music festival in Kern County in May. There were 19 people who got Valley fever and eight people were hospitalized, according to the California Department of Public Health.

“Possible causes of this recent increase include winter rains after several years of drought, an increase in soil disturbance activities (including construction) in high-risk areas, and increased disease recognition, testing and reporting. In addition, while most cases of Valley fever in California are reported from the Central Valley and Central Coast regions, cases have been increasing outside of these regions, including in the northern Central Valley and in southern California,” the health department said in a statement.

A recent study published in the journal The Lancet Regional Health, The Americas suggests that climate change may drive case rates and the seasonal patterns of infection.

The researchers examined cases of Valley fever in 17 California counties between 2000 and 2021 and noted that exposure to the fungus is highest between July and September and lowest between February and April based on when cases increased in the weeks that followed exposure.

“California has a distinct dry season (April–October) and wet season (November–March) each year, and our results show that coccidioidomycosis seasonal peaks occur most often at the end of the dry season. Anomalously wet conditions in the prior wet season as well as anomalously dry conditions during the concurrent dry season are associated with more pronounced seasonal peaks in incidence,” the researchers wrote.

The study says the findings can help inform public health messaging, by explaining “when to avoid particularly dusty environments and dust-generating activities and, when dust exposure is not avoidable, when to use dust suppression techniques, such as wetting soil before disturbing.” People can use N95 masks to prevent inhaling fungal spores."
health,Starting college life? Here are 5 tips to manage mental health,2024-09-10,Andrea Kane,"Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here.

(CNN) — College students are carrying a lot of baggage with them as they head off to campus this fall — and not just the usual dorm accoutrements. And many parents may be worried about whether their kids are going to be all right.

Besides facing the usual stressors of family life, nonstop work in high school and the struggle to get into college, many students have experienced years of navigating social media pressures, managing climate anxiety, practicing drills in case of a school shooting and (more recently) negotiating divisive protests over the war in Gaza.

On top of these issues are the social, emotional, educational, familial and financial setbacks that a great deal of them experienced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

It’s no wonder that these and other factors led experts to declare a national state of emergency in youth mental health in 2021. (The situation has improved since then, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it’s still not pretty.)

“Unfortunately, the picture is not a good one,” psychologist Dr. Nance Roy told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently.

Roy is the chief clinical officer at The JED Foundation, a nonprofit focused on the emotional well-being of teenagers and young adults, and an assistant clinical professor in the Yale School of Medicine’s department of psychiatry.

“Look at what’s happening in our world. I mean, the environmental factors … school shootings, hate crimes, political divisiveness, financial insecurity, war,” Roy said. “These are the things that our young people are growing up with.

“They’ve not yet had a period of stability within which to sort of place the conflicts that they’re living with right now and the challenges that they’re facing. This is their only reality.”

But Roy said she is not pessimistic. “A lot of folks talk about, ‘We’re having a mental health crisis right now among our young people,’” she said. “And I’d like to reframe that. … ‘Crisis’ I think is a difficult word because it suggests that there isn’t hope, when in fact there is some hope.”

You can listen to the podcast’s full episode here.

One of the biggest challenges facing students, Roy said, is the same one confronting society at large.

“We see really loneliness being the biggest issue for first-year students,” she said. “When you think about that, it makes sense, right? They’re moving away from their holding environments, moving away from family, friends, connections that they had.”

Roy said it takes time to build relationships. “They’re navigating their way for the first time independently. They’re having to develop their own sense of routine and structures. Nothing’s built in like it often is when they’re in high school and living at home,” she added, noting that some schools are better than others about creating situations that allow students to mix and mingle in an organic, nonstructured way.

As for coping with the effects of the pandemic, Roy said people do not recover spontaneously the moment a catastrophic event ends. “It takes many years for people to deal with … the trauma that they experienced, the devastation. And so the pandemic is no different, right? Just because the pandemic is — quote — over, as we say, doesn’t mean everybody’s back to normal,” she said.

“We need to allow for people, young people especially, to repair, to be able to come back to learning skills that got rusty, reengaging in the world,” she said. “Especially when we work with schools, we talk with them about being mindful about what these students are bringing with them and helping them not dismiss it but helping them navigate their way through it.”

How can students (and their stressed-out parents) make the transition to college in a way that supports their mental health? Roy has these five tips for families.

Expect mixed emotions

Transitioning or returning to college can bring up feelings of both excitement and anxiety, Roy said in an email.

“Living independently, meeting new people, and making friends are some of the best parts of the college experience, but it takes time and patience to get acclimated to campus and a new routine,” she noted.

Roy suggested setting a schedule that includes time for studying as well as for relaxing and making connections. “Try putting yourself out there — maybe that’s joining a club, fraternity or sorority, or volunteer organization,” she said.

Bumps in the road are to be expected. Have grace and patience with yourself if the adjustment takes longer than you expected.

Know that relationships will evolve

Relationships with family members and friends will likely change during college, Roy said.

“It takes time and patience to adjust to new boundaries and relationship dynamics,” she said. “Students will increasingly navigate their way independently while parents support them from the sidelines.”

At the same time, Roy said, it’s important for parents to remain available and for students to know it’s OK to reach out when help is needed.

You got this!

Transitioning or returning to a new living, social or academic environment may be challenging at times, but adjusting to these changes doesn’t always require professional attention.

“Often, what’s needed is a caring, compassionate support system and time to navigate the ups and downs of college life,” she said.

As for parents and caregivers, “it’s important to tune in to your own anxieties to try to separate your worries from what your student is actually experiencing,” Roy said.

Having empathetic conversations and asking gentle questions can help a parent understand what might be going on while allowing the student to feel understood and supported.

Practice self-care regularly

Intentionally build in time and space to take care of yourself.

“Self-care doesn’t just happen on its own,” Roy said. “Getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising, and engaging in mindfulness practices as well as pleasurable activities will go a long way in making it easier to navigate life’s challenges.”

Making self-care a daily habit can be challenging for everyone, she said, especially when you’re on your own and learning to manage new situations. Roy recommended taking the time to think about what you need when it comes to self-care and actively planning how to accomplish those goals.

Familiarize yourself with campus resources

Find out what resources are available on your campus, including financial aid and academic support, accessibility, health and counseling services, Roy advised.

“If you have a physical or mental health condition prior to entering or returning to school, it’s important to contact the health or counseling office in advance to establish a care plan on or off campus so everything you need is in place before the demands of the semester are upon you,” she said.

“Remember: These services are here to assist you should you have questions or need help. In fact, they can make your college experience that much more meaningful.”

You can also go off campus for help. Roy said JED’s Set to Go hub offers resources to support students and their parents and caregivers as they navigate this transition.

“You can always ask for help or support if you need it,” she said.

health,"Exercise may help you store fat better, new research suggests",2024-09-10,Madeline Holcombe,"Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.

CNN —

Exercise doesn’t just help you lose fat. It could also promote healthier fat, according to a new study.

“Living a physically active lifestyle, exercising regularly over time, makes our fat tissue a more accommodating place for extra energy under conditions when we do gain weight,” said senior study author Dr. Jeffrey Horowitz, professor of movement studies in the school of kinesiology at the University of Michigan.

To see how exercise impacts fat tissue, researchers compared fat tissue just under the skin from two groups of 16 people with obesity: those who reported exercising at least four times a week for at least 2 years, and those who did not exercise regularly, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Metabolism.

Those who had a history of regular exercise had fat cells that showed characteristics that increase how much fat they can store — the amount of blood vessels, protein composition and fewer inflammatory cells, Horowitz said.

It is important that the fat tissue under the skin has a greater capacity so that if a person does gain weight, it can go there instead of more dangerous places, such as the heart or liver, he added.

“Unfortunately, most of us, even regular exercisers, gain weight as we get older,” Horowitz said. “If we have a greater capacity to store that in our fat tissue, less of it’ll go to our liver, less of it will go to our heart, less will go to all these other places that in excess can be really problematic.”

This study shows that researchers need to learn more about fat tissue and how it is connected to metabolic health and lifestyle changes, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman was not involved in this study.

“Just being overweight may not be the whole story,” he said.

Better fat tissue

Many people have an immediate negative reaction to the word “fat.” But that isn’t always helpful, Horowitz said.

“Fat tissue itself is very, very important for health,” he said. “It’s actuallyan important reservoir of our extra energy.”

The tissue used to be understood as only functioning to store energy, but researchers are just starting to learn it has many functions, Freeman said. “It makes sense to have some degree of fat so you have some reserve, but not to the point that the typical American has,” he said.

The goal isn’t more fat tissue, but better capacity to store it, Horowitz said. Fat tissue is supposed to be stored under the skin, and if it can’t go there it’s going to go other places such as your liver, heart or pancreas, he added. More fat in those organs impede how well they function, Horowitz said.

Exercise recommendations

They key takeaway of the study is that healthier fat storage is just another good reason to live a physically active life, Horowitz said.

“We’re not changing therecommendation, but we’re expanding the understanding of why it is helpful to exercise,” he said.

If you want to start, Freeman recommends trying out exercise first thing in the morning.

“It works as a natural stimulant, just as well as coffee in many cases,” he said. And you don’t need to worry about getting to or paying for a gym.

“There are so many ways to exercise, and figuring out a way to make it part of the daily routine so it becomes a habit, is the most critical of all,” Freeman added.

Getting 30 minutes daily of breathless activity where you are working really hard is the goal, but you can start even by walking around your block, he said.

“Of course, you should check with your doctor first to make sure it’s safe,” Freeman said."

science,Nuclear clocks could surpass precision of atomic ones,2024-09-10,Mindy Weisberger,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Picture a clock ticking so steadily that it doesn’t lose a second, even after running for 1 billion years. Scientists are now closer than ever to realizing that level of timekeeping precision, new research has revealed.

Such a device would greatly surpass the capabilities of atomic clocks, which define the span of a second through controlled energy jumps in atoms’ electrons and are currently the pinnacle of accuracy for measuring time. In atomic clocks, signals that excite the atoms oscillate at a frequency of billions of times per second.

Researchers recently developed a technique that could elevate this accuracy by triggering and measuring oscillations in an even trickier target: an atom’s nucleus. For this nuclear clock, the scientists used ultraviolet light to excite nuclear particles in an atom of thorium-229 embedded in solid crystal. They then measured the frequency of the energy pulses affecting the nucleus — the equivalent of a pendulum in a regular clock — by counting the waves in the UV signal using a tool called an optical frequency comb.

Causing energy jumps in a nucleus requires a much higher frequency signal than is required for atomic clocks. With more wave cycles per second, this approach is expected to provide more accurate time measurements.

Scientists measure the frequency of energy pulses affecting an atom's nucleus by counting the waves in the UV signal. Wavelengths that can induce a nucleus transition oscillate at higher frequencies, enabling more precise time measurements, the researchers say. National Institute of Standards and Technology

While their nuclear clock is still a work in progress, once realized it could transform not only timekeeping but also the study of physics, even affecting how scientists investigate the fabric of the universe. The prototype is already as accurate as an atomic clock, and future versions are expected to be even more precise and stable, according to research published September 4 in the journal Nature.

Now that the researchers have shown that it’s possible to produce and measure these signals, “there are a lot of things that we can push to further improve the accuracy,” said lead study author Chuankun Zhang, a graduate student at JILA — a joint research center funded by the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

For example, Zhang told CNN, adjustments could include tweaking the alignment and frequency of the lasers pinging the nucleus.

“This work truly marks the dawn of a nuclear clock,” said Dr. Olga Kocharovskaya, a distinguished professor of physics at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the research.

In 2023, Kocharovskaya and other researchers tested nuclei of scandium-45 atoms as possible candidates for a nuclear clock. At the time, those atoms produced the most robust energy transition — and measurable pulse — ever seen in a nucleus, but the new results from thorium-229 generated a stronger signal and were more stable, Kocharovskaya told CNN in an email.

“The broader significance is in the confidence this paper provides in the reality of the nuclear clock,” she said. “It leaves no doubts that such a clock is feasible and will be built soon.”

Time after time

In atomic clocks, an atom’s electrons are pinged with electromagnetic radiation at specific frequencies. Bursts of energy excite the electrons, pushing them into a higher orbit around the atom. Oscillations that trigger electrons’ transitions between states mark the passage of time, according to NASA.

The reliability of atomic clocks is far greater than in everyday clocks that measure seconds in vibrations of quartz crystals, which are prone to dropping out of sync. For decades, atomic clocks have been used in GPS technologies, for space exploration and for keeping international time.

However, atomic clocks are also vulnerable to sync loss. Electromagnetic disturbances can disrupt excited electrons and affect the precision of the timekeeping, Zhang said.

Particles in an atom’s nucleus, on the other hand, are harder to agitate than electrons. Protons and neutrons are tightly bound together by the strong nuclear force — the most powerful of all the fundamental forces. Wavelengths that can induce a nucleus transition oscillate at higher frequencies, enabling more precise time measurements, the researchers reported.

Before this study, there were several important breakthroughs for the development of nuclear clocks. The first, in 1976, was the discovery that the thorium nucleus was “uniquely low-energy” and could be pushed into an excited state by using vacuum ultraviolet, or VUV, laser light. By 2003, scientists were proposing that because thorium required less energy to excite its nucleus than most other types of atoms did, the isotope thorium-229 would be a good candidate for nuclear clocks, according to the study.

In 2023, scientists pioneered a method of embedding thorium-229 into crystals; this solid state system suppressed signals from nuclear decay, making desired signals easier to track. Earlier this year, other researchers measured the wavelength of VUV light required to excite the nucleus in thorium-229.

“Our work builds on top of that,” Zhang said. “With our frequency comb light source and this crystal, we were able to excite the nuclear transition and the various transition energies.” Their results were about 1 million times more precise than previous measurements, Zhang added.

“This paper is a real tour de force,” said Dr. Shimon Kolkowitz, an associate professor and chair of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.

“The quality of the data and the speed with which they achieved the remarkable results in this new manuscript is really amazing,” said Kolkowitz, who was not involved in the research. “It represents a major step forward in the development of nuclear clocks, which physicists have been working towards for decades.”

Revolutionizing physics

Atomic clocks’ accuracy and stability have already given scientists important tools for studying earthquakes, gravitational fields and space-time. These fields could experience “a major boost” from nuclear clocks, Kocharovskaya said. Nuclear clocks would be not only more precise but also simpler and more portable, because unlike atomic clocks they wouldn’t require high vacuum conditions, extreme cooling and powerful shielding from magnetic and electric disruption, she said.

The study of physics itself could be revolutionized by using nuclear clocks alongside atomic clocks, according to Zhang. Monitoring and comparing frequency ratios in the two types of clocks over time could help scientists tell whether fundamental physics constants are truly as constant as they seem or if they shift at levels previously too minuscule to measure, Zhang said.

This paired clock technique could be a game changer for the study of dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 80% of the universe but which has never been directly measured, he added.

Some scientists have proposed that dark matter interacts with particles such as electrons, quarks and gluons, but in amounts that are currently undetectable.

“We want to see if dark matter could interact with the atomic nucleus in a slightly different way compared to the electron orbit in the atom,” Zhang said. “If the nuclear clock and the atomic clock transition frequency ratio is changing over time, it would be an indication of new physics.”

Though there is still much progress to be made before nuclear clocks surpass the performance of atomic clocks — or replace them — these findings hint that such a time isn’t far off, Kolkowitz said.

“As better UV laser sources are developed and as some of the mysteries and tricks of nuclear clocks get worked out, I expect that eventually some of the kinds of experiments we are currently doing in my lab to test relativity and search for new physics with atomic clocks will instead be performed with nuclear clocks,” Kolkowitz said.

What’s next for nuclear clocks? At this point, only time will tell.

Picture a clock ticking so steadily that it doesn’t lose a second, even after running for 1 billion years. Scientists are now closer than ever to realizing that level of timekeeping precision, new research has revealed.

Such a device would greatly surpass the capabilities of atomic clocks, which define the span of a second through controlled energy jumps in atoms’ electrons and are currently the pinnacle of accuracy for measuring time. In atomic clocks, signals that excite the atoms oscillate at a frequency of billions of times per second.

Researchers recently developed a technique that could elevate this accuracy by triggering and measuring oscillations in an even trickier target: an atom’s nucleus. For this nuclear clock, the scientists used ultraviolet light to excite nuclear particles in an atom of thorium-229 embedded in solid crystal. They then measured the frequency of the energy pulses affecting the nucleus — the equivalent of a pendulum in a regular clock — by counting the waves in the UV signal using a tool called an optical frequency comb.

Causing energy jumps in a nucleus requires a much higher frequency signal than is required for atomic clocks. With more wave cycles per second, this approach is expected to provide more accurate time measurements.

Scientists measure the frequency of energy pulses affecting an atom's nucleus by counting the waves in the UV signal. Wavelengths that can induce a nucleus transition oscillate at higher frequencies, enabling more precise time measurements, the researchers say. National Institute of Standards and Technology

While their nuclear clock is still a work in progress, once realized it could transform not only timekeeping but also the study of physics, even affecting how scientists investigate the fabric of the universe. The prototype is already as accurate as an atomic clock, and future versions are expected to be even more precise and stable, according to research published September 4 in the journal Nature.

Now that the researchers have shown that it’s possible to produce and measure these signals, “there are a lot of things that we can push to further improve the accuracy,” said lead study author Chuankun Zhang, a graduate student at JILA — a joint research center funded by the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

For example, Zhang told CNN, adjustments could include tweaking the alignment and frequency of the lasers pinging the nucleus.

CNN —

The Europa Clipper spacecraft passed a key milestone on Monday and is on track to launch next month to explore and seek signs of habitability on one of Jupiter’s moons, according to NASA. The launch window for its journey opens on October 10.

The mission passed Key Decision Point E, a critical planning stage approving the mission to move forward with launch. The approval was a relief to the Europa Clipper team after the discovery in May of a possible issue with transistors on the spacecraft.

Transistors help control the vehicle’s flow of electricity, and engineers were concerned about the components’ survival in Jupiter’s harsh radiation environment.

Extensive testing of the transistors took place over four months at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland; and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

The team was able to complete necessary testing in time, preventing a 13-month delay of the launch to explore Europa, an ice-covered world that may have the potential to support life in its salty, subsurface ocean. Europa Clipper carries 10 science instruments that could determine whether life is possible on another place in our solar system besides Earth.

Now, Europa Clipper has been approved to launch, with no changes to the mission plan, goals or trajectory.

“It’s the last sort of big review before we really get into that launch fever, and we’re really happy to say that they unequivocally passed that review today,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, during a news conference Monday.

Solving the radiation problem

In May, the manufacturer of the transistors alerted the mission team that the parts may not be as radiation-resistant as previously believed. The transistors are located across the spacecraft.

Jupiter dwarfs other worlds as the largest planet in our solar system, and it has a magnetic field 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s. That magnetic field traps charged particles and accelerates them to high speeds. The rapidly moving particles release energy in the form of intense radiation that bombards Europa and Jupiter’s other closest moons.

Any spacecraft heading to Jupiter needs radiation-hardened electronics.

“Jupiter’s engulfed in more radiation than any planet in our solar system, and that’s one of the reasons why exploring the Jupiter system is so challenging,” said Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager at JPL.

“Europa sits near the outer edge of the worst part of that radiation belt,” he added. “Flying near Europa exposes us to this high flux of damaging particles, and so the mission engineers and Europa Clipper need to be sure that the spacecraft components can survive that radiation environment for the duration of our four-year mission.”

Data from previous NASA missions to Jupiter, including the Juno probe currently studying the planet and some of its moons, was used to validate the testing process for the transistors, Evans said.

The tests were conducted 24 hours a day since May, and they simulated spaceflight conditions to see how the spacecraft and its components would fare when the vehicle conducts 49 flybys of Europa and ultimately 80 orbits around Jupiter over a four-year period.

The team determined that the transistors can self-heal in between flybys.

“We concluded, after all of this testing, that during our orbits around Jupiter, while Europa Clipper does dip into the radiation environment, once it comes out, it comes out long enough to give those transistors the opportunity to heal and partially recover between flybys,” Evans said.

A radiation monitor on the spacecraft will enable the team to check how the transistors are faring.

“I personally have high confidence that we can complete the original mission for exploring Europa as planned,” Evans said.

Exploring an ocean world

When Curt Niebur, Europa Clipper program scientist, began working at NASA in 2003, he faced the task of pushing a Europa mission forward. Each year, the effort to get Europa Clipper designed and built has seemed more difficult, he said.

“There was no harder year than this past year and especially this past summer,” Niebur said. “But through all of that, the one thing that we never doubted was that this was going to be worth it. It’s a chance for us to explore, not a world that might have been habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable today — a chance to do the first exploration of this new kind of world that we’ve discovered very recently called an ocean world that is just totally immersed and covered in a liquid water ocean completely unlike anything we’ve seen before. That’s what’s waiting us at Europa.”

Europa Clipper is not a life-detection mission, Niebur added.

The mission’s key goals are centered on figuring out whether the proper ingredients to support life as we know it — including water, energy and chemistry — are on Europa. And without any scientific instrument that can directly determine the existence of life, Clipper can’t conclusively find evidence of it, he said.

“You can bet your bottom dollar that if Europa Clipper tells us, yes, those ingredients are there, that we are going to be knocking on the door fighting for second mission to go looking for life,” Niebur said.

Europa Clipper will be key to helping NASA determine where to send follow-up missions, such as parts of the ice crust that may be thin and where water from the subsurface ocean could gush, said Laurie Leshin, director for JPL.

“If we get there and we do this investigation, and the good news is it has all the ingredients and it is habitable, what that means is that there are two places in one solar system that have all the ingredients for life that are habitable right now at the same time,” Niebur said.

“Think of what that means when you extend that result to the billions and billions of other solar systems in this galaxy,” he added. “Setting aside the ‘Is there life’ question on Europa, just the habitability question in and of itself opens up a huge new paradigm for searching for life in the galaxy.”"

CNN —

In H.G. Wells’ 1897 science fiction novel, “The Invisible Man,” the protagonist invents a serum that makes the cells in his body transparent by controlling how they bend light.

More than 100 years later, scientists have discovered a real-life version of the substance: A commonly used food coloring found in snack foods and candies such as tortilla chips and candy corn can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing scientists to see its organs function, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.

The breakthrough could revolutionize biomedical research and, should it be successfully tested in humans, have wide-ranging applications in medicine and health care, such as making veins more visible to draw blood.

Researchers made the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice transparent by applying a mixture of water and a yellow food coloring called tartrazine. Washing away any remaining solution reversed the process, which did not harm the animals. The mice’s fur was removed before the application of the solution.

“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said the study’s first author, Zihao Ou, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a statement.

Time-lapse images of blood vessels in the brain just beneath the skull of a sedated mouse are revealed by dyeing the tissues with FD&C Yellow No. 5, a food coloring also known as tartrazine. The process doesn't involve any surgery, incisions or damaging of the mouse’s bone or skin. US NSF

Light-absorbing dye molecules

The “magic” uses insights from the field of optics. Light-absorbing dye molecules enhance the transmission of light through the skin by suppressing the tissue’s ability to scatter light.

The dye, when mixed with water, modifies the refractive index — a measure of the way a substance bends light — of the aqueous part of the tissue to better match the index of proteins and fats in the tissue. The process is akin to a dissipating cloud of fog.

“We combined the yellow dye, which is a molecule that absorbs most light, especially blue and ultraviolet light, with skin, which is a scattering medium,” said Ou, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.

“Individually, these two things block most light from getting through them,” he said. “But when we put them together, we were able to achieve transparency of the mouse skin.”

Once the dye had completely diffused into the skin, the skin became transparent.

“It takes a few minutes for the transparency to appear,” Ou said. “It’s similar to the way a facial cream or mask works: The time needed depends on how fast the molecules diffuse into the skin.”

The team experimented with chicken breasts before conducting work on live animals.

In mice, the researchers were able to observe blood vessels directly in the surface of the brain through the transparent skin of the skull. The mice’s internal organs were visible in the abdomen as well as the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract.

The transparent areas take on an orangish color, Ou said, similar to that of the food dye.

The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children. A state bill, if signed into law, would ban the use of the food coloring in food served in public schools in California.

Ou said it was important that the dye is biocompatible — safe for living organisms. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work,” he said.

Possible biomedical applications for humans

The researchers have not tested the process on humans, and it’s not clear what dosage of dye or delivery method would be necessary. Human skin is about 10 times thicker than that of a mouse, according to the researchers.

“Looking forward, this technology could make veins more visible, easing … the procedure of drawing blood or administering fluids via a needle — especially for elderly patients with veins that are difficult to locate,” said senior author Guosong Hong, a Stanford assistant professor of materials science, via email.

“Moreover, this innovation could assist in the early detection of skin cancer, improve light penetration for deep tissue treatments like photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and make laser-based tattoo removal more straightforward.”

Christopher Rowlands, a senior lecturer in the department of bioengineering at Imperial College London, said he was “kicking himself” for not coming up with the same insight as the Stanford-led team, which is based on the widely studied and long-standing physics principle called Kramers-Kronig relations: When a material absorbs a lot of light at one color, it will bend light more at other colors.

“It’s blatantly obvious when someone points it out, but no one had thought of it for 100 and something years,” said Rowlands, who wasn’t involved in the study but coauthored a commentary published alongside the research.

Along with Jon Gorecki, an experimental optical physicist at the same institution who also wasn’t involved in the study, Rowlands wrote that the approach offered a new way to visualize the structure and activity of deep tissues and organs in a living animal in a safe, temporary and noninvasive manner.

“It just works. You rub it on a mouse, and you can see what it had for breakfast. It’s that powerful,” he added.

Rowlands and Gorecki said that existing methods to turn tissue transparent use solutions that have side effects such as dehydration and swelling and can alter the structure of the tissue. However, tartrazine was used at a low concentration, and its effects were easily undone, potentially facilitating prolonged study of biological processes in live animals, they wrote.

The duo noted the discovery was an example of life imitating art, with the dye solution echoing the serum imagined in “The Invisible Man.”

“The protagonist (in the story) invents a serum that renders the cells in his body transparent by precisely controlling their refractive index to match that of the surrounding medium, air,” they wrote.

“One hundred twenty-seven years later … biocompatible dyes make living tissues transparent by tuning the refractive index of the surrounding medium to match that of the cells.”

However, Ou and Hong said a totally invisible mouse was a stretch: The current approach cannot render bone transparent.

“So far, we only tested soft tissues, including brain, muscle, and skin. We haven’t done much investigation with hard tissues such as bone, so I am not sure if we would be able to make the mouse completely invisible,” Ou said via email.

“However, a partially transparent (mouse) will already enable numerous research opportunities to answer questions relating to development, regeneration, as well as aging.”"

The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children. A state bill, if signed into law, would ban the use of the food coloring in food served in public schools in California.

Ou said it was important that the dye is biocompatible — safe for living organisms. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work,” he said.

Possible biomedical applications for humans

The researchers have not tested the process on humans, and it’s not clear what dosage of dye or delivery method would be necessary. Human skin is about 10 times thicker than that of a mouse, according to the researchers.

“Looking forward, this technology could make veins more visible, easing … the procedure of drawing blood or administering fluids via a needle — especially for elderly patients with veins that are difficult to locate,” said senior author Guosong Hong, a Stanford assistant professor of materials science, via email.

“Moreover, this innovation could assist in the early detection of skin cancer, improve light penetration for deep tissue treatments like photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and make laser-based tattoo removal more straightforward.”

Christopher Rowlands, a senior lecturer in the department of bioengineering at Imperial College London, said he was “kicking himself” for not coming up with the same insight as the Stanford-led team, which is based on the widely studied and long-standing physics principle called Kramers-Kronig relations: When a material absorbs a lot of light at one color, it will bend light more at other colors.

“It’s blatantly obvious when someone points it out, but no one had thought of it for 100 and something years,” said Rowlands, who wasn’t involved in the study but coauthored a commentary published alongside the research.

Along with Jon Gorecki, an experimental optical physicist at the same institution who also wasn’t involved in the study, Rowlands wrote that the approach offered a new way to visualize the structure and activity of deep tissues and organs in a living animal in a safe, temporary and noninvasive manner.

“It just works. You rub it on a mouse, and you can see what it had for breakfast. It’s that powerful,” he added.

Rowlands and Gorecki said that existing methods to turn tissue transparent use solutions that have side effects such as dehydration and swelling and can alter the structure of the tissue. However, tartrazine was used at a low concentration, and its effects were easily undone, potentially facilitating prolonged study of biological processes in live animals, they wrote.

The duo noted the discovery was an example of life imitating art, with the dye solution echoing the serum imagined in “The Invisible Man.”

“The protagonist (in the story) invents a serum that renders the cells in his body transparent by precisely controlling their refractive index to match that of the surrounding medium, air,” they wrote.

“One hundred twenty-seven years later … biocompatible dyes make living tissues transparent by tuning the refractive index of the surrounding medium to match that of the cells.”

However, Ou and Hong said a totally invisible mouse was a stretch: The current approach cannot render bone transparent.

“So far, we only tested soft tissues, including brain, muscle, and skin. We haven’t done much investigation with hard tissues such as bone, so I am not sure if we would be able to make the mouse completely invisible,” Ou said via email.

“However, a partially transparent (mouse) will already enable numerous research opportunities to answer questions relating to development, regeneration, as well as aging.”"

CNN —

SpaceX’s latest mission — a bold and risky trek into Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts by a four-person crew of civilians who will also aim to conduct the first commercial spacewalk — just took flight.

The mission, dubbed Polaris Dawn, lifted off at 5:23 a.m. ET.

SpaceX livestreamed the event on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk purchased in 2022.

As the capsule entered Earth’s orbit, ground controllers, led by SpaceX launch director Frank Messina, offered words of encouragement to the Polaris Dawn crew, which includes the first SpaceX employees ever to venture to space.

“As you gaze towards the North Star, remember that your courage lights the path for future explorers. We trust your skills, your bravery, and your teamwork to carry out the mission that lies ahead,” they said. “Know that the entire team back here is with you every step, watching, supporting and cheering you on as you walk into space. We’re sending you hugs from the ground.”

This launch comes after several weather delays in late August and earlier in the morning on Tuesday hampered the Polaris Dawn crew’s efforts to get off the ground.

Further complicating launch prospects was the fact that SpaceX didn’t just need clear weather for the mission to take off — it needed to ensure there are calm waters and winds as the crew will return from space after a five-day excursion. Timing their return could be critical. Because carrying out a spacewalk will create a drain on oxygen supplies, the Polaris Dawn mission will have only enough life support for five or six days in space.

The ride to orbit

After the countdown clock struck zero, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket roared to life, sending a blinding blaze and deafening blast across the launch site at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The crew rode atop the rocket, strapped inside an igloo-shaped SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which measures about 13 feet (4 meters) across at its base, as the rocket tore away from the grips of Earth’s gravity.

After firing for 2 ½ minutes, the bottommost part of the Falcon 9 rocket — called the first stage — spent most of its fuel. At that point, the first stage detached from the rocket’s second stage as the upper portion fired up its engine and continued propelling the Crew Dragon spacecraft to faster speeds.

Meanwhile, the first stage of the Falcon 9 guided itself back to Earth to land on a seafaring platform so it could be refurbished and used again on future missions. That’s a signature SpaceX move that the company said helps reduce the cost of rocket launches.

To enter Earth’s orbit, the Falcon 9 rocket hit more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,358 kilometers per hour), or “orbital velocity.” When it reached the desired speed, the Crew Dragon broke away, navigating the vacuum of space using only its onboard thrusters for the remainder of the mission.

First commercial spacewalk attempt

Polaris Dawn is the brainchild of SpaceX and Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of financial technology firm Shift4 Payments, who made his first foray into spaceflight with the Inspiration4 mission in September 2021.

This flight, however, is not a joyride.

Isaacman and his crewmates — including close friend and former US Air Force pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet as well as SpaceX engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis — hope to rack up several superlatives on this mission.

First, the SpaceX capsule aims to carry the crew to record-setting heights for an orbit around Earth, surpassing the milestone set by NASA’s 1966 Gemini 11 mission, which reached 853 miles (1,373 kilometers). If successful, Polaris Dawn would beat that record by about 20 miles (32 kilometers).

The Polaris Dawn spaceflight would also be the highest any human has flown since NASA’s Apollo program — which ended in 1972 and cumulatively carried 24 astronauts a quarter million miles to the moon rather than stopping in Earth’s orbit.

Polaris Dawn may also mark the farthest any woman has ever gone into space.

To kick off day three of this mission, the civilian crew, while orbiting at a lower altitude of about 435 miles (700 kilometers) above Earth, will attempt a history-making spacewalk.

The endeavor will be hazardous, exposing all four crew members and the Crew Dragon’s interior to the vacuum of space. Such a situation may make it difficult to relock the vehicle’s hatch due to differences in pressure. And exposure to the vacuum may cause toxins to be released from hardware when the cabin is repressurized, though SpaceX said it has taken steps to prevent this."

health,"Food as fuel might not be the healthiest approach, experts say",2024-09-01,Madeline Holcombe,"It’s been a hard day. The worst thing you could do is reach for the chocolate chip cookies that taste like the ones your family always had when you were a kid – right?

Not necessarily, said Jennifer Rollin, founder of The Eating Disorder Center in Rockville, Maryland.

Eating driven by emotions, otherwise known as emotional eating, is often painted as scary, unhealthy, and out of control, but the truth is that it is very normal and can be part of a healthy relationship with food, she added.

Of course, there is a line where emotional eating can become unhealthy, but it is important that people embrace nuance when it comes to ways of eating, rather than apply strict rules and shame-based strategies, said Robin Klein, a weight-inclusive eating disorder dietitian in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.

It may be time to put emotional eating into proper perspective and learn how to work with it, rather than against, for a healthier relationship with food, experts said.

What is emotional eating?

Food is inherently emotional, Rollin said.

You can probably think of particular foods you eat as part of a cultural tradition, when you are connecting socially or when you are celebrating an accomplishment, she added.

“If you think about it, our lives are centered around food. Food can be really comforting, and a lot of us build traditions in all of our cultures around food that is nostalgic and sentimental,” Klein said.

Human bodies are also built to enjoy food, so it makes sense that when you are feeling strong emotions, you reach for something that tastes or feels good, Rollin said. You shouldn’t shame yourself if eating something you enjoy is one of the tools in your coping toolkit.

“We don’t shame ourselves for the use of other coping tools,” she added. “Simply eating a food, sometimes for emotional reasons, is not a problem and not something that you need to judge or beat yourself up for.”

Like most coping tools, the context matters, Klein said. Are you eating to enjoy something delicious after a hard day or in celebration of a milestone? Or are you avoiding addressing a larger issue?

“We can’t ever say this is entirely good or this is entirely bad without knowing the big picture of what’s going on in somebody’s life,” she added.

The problem with food as fuel

Shouldn’t we just remove the emotion from food and think of it as just fuel to keep our bodies going?

That doesn’t always work either, Rollin said. “Yes, food is fuel … and provides energy for our brain and bodies, but it’s also so much more than that,” she said.

Sometimes, when people get too wrapped up in only eating the most nutrient dense foods, they miss out on a lot of the moments that involve food for pleasure, socialization and connection, Rollin said.

“If our vision is that food is just fuel, then it seems like going out for dessert with a friend when I’m not hungry maybe isn’t a ‘healthy option,’” she said. “However, we know that actually, social relationships are one of the biggest predictors of health and longevity.”

Another concern is that too much restriction can often backfire into binge eating, said Natalie Mokari, a registered dietician in Charlotte, North Carolina.

“Bingeing is generally a result of feeling like, ‘I shouldn’t do this, but I’m going to do it … and I’m going to do it in excess, because I’m never going eat it again,’” Mokari said. “It’s kind of this feast or famine thing.”

When to worry about binge eating

There is a line, however, when emotional eating does become a problem, and that often happens when eating is a person’s primary way to cope, Klein said.

It is important to be mindful of how often you are eating to cope with difficult emotions and if you have other strategies to process those emotions as well, she said.

Some warning signs that you are relying too much on food to cope or engaging in binge eating include: eating larger quantities than most people would in a short time, feeling a loss of control, feeling guilt and shame, eating in secret, and often eating way past the point of fullness, Rollin said.

“If you’re if you’re eating more than you feel comfortable eating, and then you’re engaging in restricting or purging or compulsive exercise, that would be another sign that your relationship to food is problematic,” she added.

How to recalibrate

A healthy relationship with food revolves around flexibility and balance, Mokari said. Can you give yourself permission to eat all kinds of foods while not feeling out of control?

The first step toward a healthier relationship with emotional eating is mindfulness, Rollin said. Instead of either restricting or reaching for the food without thinking, become aware of what purpose the food is serving and what needs it’s meeting, she said.

Maybe you are coping with boredom or stress. Maybe you want to engage with a family custom or mark an occasion with a birthday cake.

That mindfulness can also be helpful when evaluating your values, Rollin said. Is it important to you that you be known as someone who can go to a birthday party without eating cake? Or is it more important that you make memories with the people you love? Are you someone who always avoids underlying issues? Or do you want to cope while also solving bigger problems?

The key is to evaluate your values, your approach, and your relationship with food with curiosity rather than judgment, Klein added.

People can “think about it almost like they are a detective gathering data about themselves,” she said. “Is this something that is becoming a problem? Is it something that I am only coping with through food? Are there deeper layers here that need to be worked through?”

And whether you are struggling with giving yourself permission to eat, or with binge eating, it can be helpful to seek help from a therapist or dietitian that works in disordered eating, weight inclusive and anti-diet fields, Klein said.

“Making sure you go to the right type of professional is really important so that you can process some of the feelings that you’re having and not feel shame or guilt or like you’re doing something bad or wrong,” she added.

health,"Chair yoga is not just for older people. It’s good for everyone, especially the desk-bound",2024-09-03,Melanie Radzicki Mcmanus,"Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.

CNN —

Sitting down to exercise may not seem to make sense on first glance. After all, there is a reason why people uninterested in physical activity are often dubbed couch potatoes. But chair yoga is one beneficial form of exercise that embraces the seated posture.

Chair yoga is traditional yoga performed while sitting in or using a chair. Many people assume it’s an exercise for older adults, as chair yoga classes often target this demographic. In addition, many studies have documented its benefits for the older set.

Chair yoga was found to be an effective intervention for women 65 years and older with knee osteoarthritis, according to a small study published in the April 2023 edition of the journal Healthcare. The therapy boosted the women’s functional fitness and daily life activity scores, suggesting chair yoga could help lessen the risk of osteoarthritis progressing to disability.

But chair yoga is great for everyone, no matter your age, especially if you’re glued to your desk most of the day. Fifteen minutes of chair yoga or guided meditation greatly improved several physiological and psychological stress markers in study participants, according to an exploratory study published in January 2012 in the journal Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Scores of companies also offer free chair yoga to their employees specifically for stress reduction and improved health.

That’s no surprise to Stacie Dooreck, a certified yoga instructor based in Larkspur, California, who has been teaching chair yoga at companies in the San Francisco Bay Area for several decades.

“It’s safe for all ages and can be very gentle,” Dooreck said. “It also helps with flexibility, posture — people in offices are usually hunched over at their desks — and combats repetitive stress injuries, like carpal tunnel syndrome.”

Chair yoga for everybody

Despite yoga’s association with meditation and calm, Dooreck said it actually gives you a lot of energy afterward, plus improves concentration and focus.

Chair yoga also offers people another way to move their bodies, said Ansley Davis, a master trainer for YogaSix based in Chicago. While the people she typically sees opting for chair yoga are older adults, those with injuries, and those who have trouble getting up and down from the floor, she’s a fan of the practice for everyone, no matter the age or ability.

“Chair yoga is great for releasing tension and muscle soreness and for full mobility,” Davis said. “It’s also a great rest-day activity. Plus, the more you can vary your movements, the better.”

The benefits of a regular yoga practice include increased blood flow, improved sleep, better breathing and a boost to feelings of well-being, coupled with decreases in blood pressure, depression and anxiety, chronic pain and inflammation, research has shown.

How to start chair yoga

Ready to give it a try? Aim for five minutes a day to start.

“Five minutes of chair yoga a day is better than doing it once a week for an hour,” Dooreck said. “You want to create a habit. Once you do five minutes, people often want to do more because they feel better.”

If you feel any pain or discomfort while performing a movement, do not force it and ease up or take a moment to pause before moving on to the next pose.

“Whether you’re currently feeling noticeable pain or not, if you’re someone who sits or stays sedentary for a large part of the day, you’ll notice a difference over time,” Davis said. “You might suddenly realize, ‘Oh my gosh, I can look further over my shoulder,’ or, ‘I’m breathing more deeply.’”

Here are a few movements for beginners. As you perform these poses, breathe in and out through your nose. This approach fully engages the diaphragm — the main breathing muscle — and allows for a deeper and calmer breath.

Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor.

Joint warm-up

Sitting tall on the edge of the seat and facing forward, make circles with your hands and feet together or separately. This motion can prevent issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome in your wrists, plus combat fatigue in the legs, Dooreck said.

Cat-cow

This yoga movement involves arching and rounding the spine, Davis said. Sit tall and inhale as you lift your chin slightly and reach your chest forward in the cow pose, which expands the chest. Then exhale and round your spine in the cat pose, which stretches the upper back.

Side bends

Put your right hand up in the air and lean to the left, then switch sides with your left hand up in the air and leaning to the right.

Twists

Twist to one side, hold the pose for three to five breaths, then switch sides.

Seated forward bend

This movement is great for combating tension in your shoulders. Start by placing both feet flat on the floor with your chair pushed back from your desk. Raise your hands in the air, interlace your fingers, then bend forward so your chest is on your knees and your hands touch the floor.

Standing frame

Hold each elbow in the opposite palm, then raise your arms above your head. Think of pulling your arms apart while also holding them together. Hold this pose for five breaths.

Seated pose

End your session with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your thighs. Take slow, deep breaths for several minutes while being aware of your body and listening to the sounds around you. Before getting up or going back to work, place your hands over your heart, one on top of the other.

CNN —

Colostrum, the first milk produced by humans and other mammals in the earliest days after giving birth, is “liquid gold,” said Dr. Jennifer Smilowitz.

“It is packed full of nutrients, but also molecules that aren’t necessarily nutrients — they’re like these biologically active compounds that are actually protective,” said Smilowitz, an assistant professor in the department of nutrition at the University of California, Davis, whose research background is in breastfeeding, nutrition, lactation and the microbiome.

These nutrients and compounds include immunoglobulins (or antibodies), white blood cells, vitamin A, magnesium, copper, zinc, growth factors and a variety of other components essential for jump-starting life, including the strength and structure of the immune system and the gut, experts said.

These growth factors strengthen permeable, leaky intestines, sealing the gut and preventing bad bacteria or pathogens from flowing into the bloodstream in an unregulated way, Smilowitz said. The colostrum protects an infant during a vulnerable stage.

But “today we have seen a huge rise in colostrum supplements for consumption in adults — with some hefty health claims that may or may not be true,” said Caroline Thomason, a dietitian and diabetes educator based in Virginia, via email.

Colostrum supplements, often derived from cows, are popular for their potential to boost immunity, improve gut health and enhance athletic performance, said Dr. Lisa Young, a registered dietitian nutritionist and adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University in New York City, via email.

Collected from dairy cows within the first several days after birth and processed and pasteurized to be safe for human consumption, bovine colostrum is available in forms such as powders, pills and liquids, and as an enema.

“It’s a delicate process because it involves preserving the bioactive compounds while ensuring the product is safe for consumption,” Thomason said.

“The rise of influencers talking about colostrum supplements seems to have contributed to the boom (in consumption) in the last year or so,” she added.

Celebrities, too, have been touting colostrum as a health tool — social media personality and model Sofia Richie included the supplement in the $21 smoothie she launched with the upscale California-based grocery store Erewhon, and so did artist The Kid LAROI.

“However,” Thomason added, “it’s important to note that while these benefits sound exciting, the research on colostrum is still relatively new and not entirely conclusive.”

How colostrum affects human health

One main reason some people turn to colostrum for health benefits is due to gut inflammation that makes their physiology resemble that of a vulnerable infant, Smilowitz said.

That inflammation can be due to ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, chronic infections, chronic diarrhea or HIV, or the effects of chemotherapy or radiation, she added.

“There is some preliminary evidence that colostrum can support immunity and gut health, particularly in people with compromised immune systems or intestinal permeability issues,” Thomason said. Some small studies have found colostrum may boost growth of intestinal cells and strengthen the walls of the gut.

Other research has suggested benefits for respiratory tract infections. One 12-week study of 35 adult distance runners found taking a colostrum supplement daily increased the amount of certain antibodies in their saliva by 79%, which the authors thought could strengthen participants’ ability to fight infections. There were similar results in a separate study of 29 male cyclists, with a daily dose of 10 grams for five weeks associated with less decline in immune cells after exercise and a greater reduction in risk of respiratory infection.

It’s important to note that the results of these studies merely indicated changes in immune biomarkers — but not necessarily outcomes or improvements in events within the immune system, such as getting sick, said Julie Stefanski, a Pennsylvania-based registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

“And then sometimes the dose that’s used in the study is much, much higher than what’s sold in a supplement,” Stefanski added.

There are also anecdotal reports of improvement in skin health and exercise recovery, but scientific research in these areas is still lacking, Thomason said. There’s also no strong evidence supporting claims of weight loss or the reversal of age-related changes.

There’s also the matter of who pays for the research. Supplement or dairy companies, or health experts affiliated with them, have funded most of the research on colostrum supplements, which largely hasn’t been replicated, experts said. Some studies have also had mixed results, Smilowitz added.

Before you buy it

As with any supplement, consulting a health provider before starting and following the manufacturer’s instructions are crucial, Thomason said, especially if you have a gastrointestinal condition.

“Colostrum supplementation is generally considered safe for most people, but there are risks, particularly for folks with milk allergies. Large doses could potentially lead to digestive upset, such as bloating or diarrhea,” Thomason said. Children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should also avoid taking colostrum.

“Plus, these supplements are expensive, and you may not see any health improvements at all,” Thomason added.

The cost of colostrum supplements can range from around $15 to $200 per bottle, partly depending on the quality — which is important since a higher calibermeans a lesser risk for contamination, Young said.

Quality is determined by factors such as the health of the cow, its environment and diet, if it has been vaccinated, the season, its breed, the length of time between pregnancies and the time of colostrum collection, Smilowitz said.

Though calves need to receive the first of the colostrum, colostrum collected on day three or four is more healthful than colostrum gleaned a week later. Given the sensitivity of the collection process, a supplement that’s on the cheaper end is probably less effective, Stefanski said.

Additionally, colostrum from grass-fed and pasture-raised cows is better than conventionally raised cows.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration does not pre-approve supplements for safety and efficacy as it does for prescription drugs before they reach the market, knowing which colostrum supplements are more worth your money than others can be tricky.

But to choose the highest-quality supplement possible, look for products that are tested by a third party for quality and purity, recommended Keri Gans, a New York state-based registered dietitian nutritionist.

You can also check a manufacturer’s website or contact its customer service for more details that might not be on the packaging, experts said.

“While colostrum may offer some health benefits, it’s not a magic bullet, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects and long-term safety,” Young said.

Prioritizing a healthy, balanced diet as well as exercise and sleep will improve your health far more, Thomason said.

Correction: A previous version of this article inaccurately stated which component of colostrum is responsible for strengthening intestines, sealing the gut and preventing the unregulated flow of bad bacteria or pathogens. It also misstated the US Food and Drug Administration’s role in regulating supplements."

CNN —

As kids head back to school, many schools aren’t allowing them to bring their phones to class. Legislation to ban phones in schools has been proposed or passed in many cities and states. Most schools already have policies prohibiting them for nonacademic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Parents often question these policies because they want to be able to reach their kids in an emergency such as a school shooting.

Yet research suggests it’s not just a good idea for kids to put their phones away while in class — they shouldn’t bring them to school at all.

Some 97% of 11- to 17-year-olds use their phones during school time, for an average of 43 minutes, according to a 2023 Common Sense Media study. If they’re checking their phones between classes or at lunch and recess, they’re likely preoccupied with what they’re seeing on their screens and therefore spending less time talking, playing or even just hanging out with their friends.

Such preoccupation is not healthy because, as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote in “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” one of the most important things young people should be doing is playing with peers.

In doing so, they learn to navigate social dynamics and build skills by figuring out how to do different activities. It teaches them they can handle other challenges they’ll face in the future, which Haidt said can help protect them from anxiety.

Smartphones aren’t making kids smarter

But phones aren’t just intruding on kids’ time outside class. In a June Pew Research Center survey, 72% of public high school teachers said cell phone distractions are a major problem in their classrooms. If children are sneaking peeks at their phones, they can’t possibly be paying attention to what they’re supposed to be learning. A wide body of evidence tells us the human brain can’t multitask — we can only do one thing at a time.

One indicator that students aren’t learning as much at school as they did in the pre-phone era is scores on the ACT — a standardized test that measures whether they have the English, reading, math and science skills needed for first-year college courses. Last year, ACT scores dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years, according to the organization that administers the test.

As a professor who has taught at five universities since 2010, I’ve witnessed this trend myself. When I first started teaching, before smartphones became ubiquitous, many of my students arrived better able to concentrate and work through long reading passages than they are now.

Of course, it’s easy to imagine how kids will respond if we ask them to leave their phones home: They’ll promise not to check them during the school day. Unfortunately, it’s unreasonable to expect them to fight the urge to look at products that are designed to be addictive, with features such as bottomless scrolling and continuous notifications. The average teen gets 237 phone notifications a day on their phones, according to the Common Sense Media study — with a quarter coming in during the school day.

Sending kids to school sans smartphones forces them to concentrate on what’s happening in front of them rather than on their screens. That’s another important skill to learn.

“The phone-based life makes it difficult for people to be fully present with others when they are with others, and to sit silently with themselves when they are alone,” Haidt warned.

Smartphones and safety

What’s more, the idea that having a phone with them makes kids safer is often a myth.

Phones can be dangerously distracting to teens. At one of my recent talks at a private school, the school psychologist told parents she regularly sees their children walk out of school looking at their screens while crossing the streets of Manhattan. So, phones may cause emergencies in the first place.

Of course, if children have a crisis on the way home from school, in most places in the United States, there will be businesses and people around with phones who will be willing to let them call their parents.

Similarly, while many parents wish they could reach their children in the unthinkable event of a school shooting, kids will be safer if they remain quiet and focused on the instructions they receive from school administrators or law enforcement.

In addition, children often have extraordinarily dangerous experiences on their phones. In August, a report by Thorn, a nonprofit that combats child sex abuse, revealed that the great majority — 59% — of youth said they’ve had online experiences that have been potentially harmful. One in 3 minors and 1 in 5 preteens said they’d had online sexual experiences with someone they thought was an adult, according to the report.

It’s true that letting kids bring phones to school can make coordinating things like pickups after extracurricular activities easier. If children truly need a phone to communicate with their parents — perhaps because they have a medical condition and need to be able to reach someone in an emergency or because their pickup arrangements are so complicated that a time and location can’t be set in advance — one option Haidt recommended is an old-fashioned flip phone. Having one lets them text or call but not log on to social media apps.

Sending kids to school with smartphones is unlikely to make them smarter or safer. It’s more likely to distract them and make them unable to focus on learning.

Without a phone, kids can focus on interacting with peers, learning and being fully present in their surroundings — rather than having these things compete for their attention with influencers and internet memes.

health,"Weekend sleep-ins may benefit heart health, research finds",2024-08-30,Kristen Rogers,"Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.

CNN —

When it comes to maintaining a regular sleep schedule, sometimes a busy week can throw everything out of whack even when you have the best of intentions.

Naturally, catching up on sleep over the weekend is often the solution. New research suggests doing so may even benefit your heart health, amounting to a 19% lower risk of developing heart disease, according to a research abstract published Thursday. The abstract hasn’t been published in a journal but will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology’s annual congress on Sunday, September 1.

“The association becomes even more pronounced among individuals who regularly experience inadequate sleep on weekdays,” said research coauthor Yanjun Song of the State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease of the National Center for Cardiovascular Disease at Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, in a news release.

Sleeping in on weekends may lower your risk of developing heart disease later in life, new research suggests. Elena Noviello/Moment RF/Getty Images/File

The authors used data from 90,903 participants in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people generally between the ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom.

Data on participants’ sleep quantity was measured using activity-monitoring watches, and was divided into four groups, from those who compensated for lost sleep on weekends the least to those who did the most. Group No. 1 got 0.26 to 16.05 fewer hours of sleep on the weekends, while on the other end of the spectrum, group No. 4 got 1.28 to about 16 more hours of sleep on weekends than they did during the week.

After a follow-up period of nearly 14 years on average, the group with the most weekend compensatory sleep was 19% less likely to develop cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and stroke, compared with the group compensating for sleep the least on weekends.

In the subgroup of participants with daily sleep deprivation (defined as getting less than seven hours of sleep per night), those with the most compensatory sleep had a 20% lower risk of heart disease than participants who caught up on sleep the least. None of the findings differentiated by gender.

“While the study does have limitations, such as focusing exclusively on the UK population, its findings underscore the negative impact of chronic sleep deprivation on cardiovascular health,” said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, medical director of Atria New York City and clinical associate professor of medicine at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, via email. Goldberg wasn’t involved in the research.

Other experts suggested people still address inconsistent sleep patterns since it can affect more than just heart health.

Previous research into weekend sleep catchup has also shown mixed results.Past studies have found that differences in sleep duration and timing between weekdays and weekends — known as social jet lag — are linked with heart disease risk, said Dr. Nour Makarem, assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, who wasn’t involved in the research.

“Another study demonstrated that trying to make up for sleep deprivation was not effective and in fact worsened diet, resulted in weight gain and reduced insulin sensitivity,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and associate director of cardiology at the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center, via email. “So it isn’t fully clear, even with this study, which is actually the case.”

For that reason, more regular sleep patterns every day of the week are best for optimal heart health, Makarem said.

But the findings of the latest research indicate that “when this is not possible and an individual is sleep deprived during the week, sufficient compensatory sleep during the weekend may be protective,” she added.

How sleep supports heart health

Since the research is still in abstract form, it’s “unclear what other risk factors for heart disease or other aspects of sleep were accounted … for in the analysis,” Makarem said via email.

The authors did, however, account for genetic risk, which is a strength of the research, she added — and hopeful news for people with known genetic risk factors since the association between compensatory sleep and lower heart disease risk persisted regardless.

The findings could be partly explained by sleep’s relation to healthier blood glucose and blood pressure levels, better dietary choices and lower risk for obesity, Makarem said.

“Lack of sleep can lead to numerous heart issues including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart attack, obesity, diabetes, and stroke,” Goldberg said. “Additionally, interrupted sleep may elevate the risk of high blood pressure and arrhythmias.”

Sufficient sleep is also associated with better psychological health, which in turn is related to lower risk for heart disease, Makarem said. “Sleep is restorative and a key component of heart health preservation.”

There are still other unanswered questions, Gulati said: Is there a threshold of too much sleep on the weekend? Is there a minimal amount of sleep you need to get daily that you can’t make up? And for those who sleep properly, do they have an even better chance at not developing heart disease?

“Perhaps the mechanism of these findings is that making it up is better than not getting it at all,” Gulati said.

“To promote heart health, it’s recommended to aim for at least 7 hours of sleep each night and maintain a consistent sleep pattern,” Goldberg said.

That includes sleeping and waking at the same time each day as much as possible, Makarem said.

“If (you are) having trouble sleeping, you can discuss it with your doctor,” Goldberg said. “Remember, you are the best advocate for your health.”"
health,What your semen says about your health,2024-08-28,Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt,"Editor’s note: Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and past president of the Florida Urological Society.

CNN —

Just like urine and stool, semen can provide important clues about a man’s health. Variations in its color, texture, smell and volume can signal underlying health conditions. Understanding these signs can help men maintain their overall well-being and address potential issues early on.

What is normal for semen?

It is normal for semen to have minor changes in color, texture or smell. The quality may also vary from day to day or ejaculate to ejaculate — no two are exactly the same. Semen, or seminal fluid, is a mixture of fluid from the prostate, seminal vesicles and testicles.

Normal semen parameters include a sperm concentration of at least 15 million sperm per milliliter, with at least 40% of the sperm showing motility and 4% having normal morphology or appearance, according to the World Health Organization. It typically has a slightly thick, gel-like consistency. It has a faint, bleach-like smell due to its alkaline pH. The volume of ejaculate typically ranges from 1.5 to 5 milliliters per ejaculation. Semen liquifies within minutes after exiting the body, going from thick gel to smooth liquid to support the movement of sperm.

Simply said, each ejaculate has millions of sperm; not all of them have to be gold medal swimmers, and not all of them have to look normal. Also, it’s important to note that abnormal swimmers or appearance does not equal abnormal genetics or higher risk of congenital anaomolies.

Color changes

Semen is usually whitish-gray in color. The color may change as it mixes with urine, blood or other fluids in the urinary or reproductive tracts. Semen can change color from starting a B vitamin or medications. Just like there may be changes in the color of your urine when starting supplements and medications, the same can happen with the semen.

Medical conditions like liver failure or jaundice, where the entire body appears more yellow, can also discolor the semen. Even smoking can alter semen parameters with not just changes in color but a decline in fertility. Yellow or green semen might suggest an infection, such as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), urinary tract infection or prostate inflammation (prostatitis). Red or brown semen, known as hematospermia, can be alarming but is often benign, typically caused by inflammation, enlarged prostate infection or even riding a bike for too long.

Texture and consistency

Normal semen is slightly thick and gelatinous, so thick and clumpy semen might be a sign of dehydration or infection. Men with chronic dehydration often have altered semen parameters, which include texture, which can lead to a decrease in fertility. Watery semen, on the other hand, can indicate a low sperm count or frequent ejaculation, which may temporarily reduce sperm quality.

Smell

Typically, semen has a light bleach or ammonia-like smell due to its slightly alkaline pH. A strong or foul odor can be a red flag for infections such as bacterial prostatitis or STIs. A sweet smell may signal abnormal glucose levels concerning for diabetes.

Volume

The average volume of ejaculate ranges from 1.5 to 5 milliliters—about 1/3 to 1.5 teaspoons—or roughly what you would find in a small packet of ketchup. Low volume can result from frequent ejaculation, low testosterone levels or blockages in the reproductive tract. A high volume of semen may be due to prolonged abstinence or in rare cases, an infection or inflammation.

Frequency of Ejaculation

While regular ejaculation is generally healthy, very frequent ejaculation can affect semen quality. It is well known that men who ejaculate multiple times daily may experience temporary reductions in sperm count and motility, though this typically normalizes with less frequent ejaculation.

Pain during ejaculation

Painful ejaculation can be a symptom of prostatitis, urethritis and conditions like Peyronie’s disease (abnormal penile curvature) or post-vasectomy pain syndrome. A recent guideline review found that 15% to 55% of men with chronic prostatitis may experience sexual dysfunction and/or pain during ejaculation, which can significantly impact their quality of life and virality.

Lifestyle factors

Diet, hydration and overall health profoundly impact semen quality. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking can negatively affect semen health, while a healthy lifestyle can improve it.

Medications and supplements

Certain medications and supplements can alter semen’s appearance and quality. For example, testosterone replacement therapy can reduce sperm production, while supplements like zinc and folic acid can enhance semen quality.

When to see a doctor

Occasional changes in semen are usually not cause for concern. However, persistent changes should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Regular check-ups and open communication with your doctor are crucial for maintaining sexual health and addressing any issues early. It’s important to remind your doctor of any medication or over-the-counter supplements you’re taking.

Semen can provide valuable insights into a man’s health. By paying attention to its color, texture, smell and volume, men can detect potential health issues early. If you notice persistent changes, consulting with a healthcare provider can help ensure your sexual health remains in top shape.

health,"Your ZIP code may determine your dementia diagnosis, study finds",2024-08-26,Sandee Lamotte,"Imagine: You and your sister are 66-year-old twins on Medicare who share the same family history of Alzheimer’s disease, making an early diagnosis critical for long-term planning and preventive health care. Since Medicare provides coverage for a cognitive screening as part of each year’s wellness visit, you believe that diagnosis, if needed, will occur.

Let’s say you live in Hartford, Connecticut. Your sister is some 26 miles away in Springfield, Massachusetts — so close that you often share Sunday dinners. Yet according to a new study, you are 18% more likely to obtain a diagnosis of dementia in Hartford than your sister in Springfield.

How could this be? According to Medicare data, the health care system in Connecticut may be doing a better job than Massachusetts of screening and diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias and referring patients to specialists, said lead study author Julie Bynum, a professor of internal medicine and geriatric and palliative medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.

Such disparities happen across the United States, Bynum said. In fact, depending on your ZIP code, you may be twice as likely to be diagnosed in some areas of the country as others.

Compared with the national average, people who live in ZIP codes with the lowest diagnostic intensity — a measure of how often doctors offer tests and treatments to patients — are 28% less likely to get a timely diagnosis, the study found.

Those who live in regions with the highest diagnostic intensity — where physicians may be more aggressive in their level of care — are 36% more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, according to the study.

“There’s some sort of behavior in different health systems in the way we look at people with this disease, regardless of your level of risk,” Bynum said. “Without that diagnosis, you can’t get educated, you can’t prepare.”

Bynum had access to data broken down by ZIP code for the purposes of her research, but she was unable to publish the ZIP codes due to Medicare privacy restrictions. A map below, which CNN created from the study, provides a bird’s-eye view of which states or regions fared better or worse.

People who live in areas colored in dark and light orange are more likely to get a timely dementia diagnosis than those who live in regions colored with dark and mid-blue tones, a new study finds. CNN

An ‘unjust’ reality

The study highlights how patients are getting different care “depending on where they live and who they are, and that is unjust,” said Dr. Eseosa Ighodaro, an incoming assistant professor of neurology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

“This research is timely because now we have medications we didn’t have before 2021 that we can give patients who have mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease,” said Ighodaro, who was not involved in the new study.

“If we don’t do something about these disparities, there are people who are going to be left out of being able to receive these disease-modifying treatments,” she added. “That is horrible.”

An early diagnosis also allows people to be eligible for clinical trials, receive specialized treatment and care, and improve their quality of life, said Lycia Neumann, senior director of health services research for the Alzheimer’s Association. She was not involved in the new study.

“Everyone has exactly the same right to receive a diagnosis of this nature — that’s the first step for them to understand why they are noticing signs and symptoms and to change how they manage their daily lives and even their relationships with their family,” Neumann said.

“Knowing where disparities exist is the first step for us to be able to address them,” she added. “We need to do better. We need to ensure that these differences don’t exist.”

Move across the country, get a different diagnosis

Traditionally, research has shown the largest percentage of Alzheimer’s and dementia cases occur in the Southeast, known as the “stroke belt” because deaths from stroke are two to four times higher in those states than in other regions, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“However, obesity is widespread across the US, as is high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that contribute to dementia,” Bynum said. “So why would the majority of diagnoses be in the South?”

Alzheimer's diagnoses are traditionally higher in the Southeast, known as the ""stroke belt."" The darkest color indicates the most cases and the lightest color the fewest. CNN

To find out, she and her team spent years analyzing Medicare claims data from each of 306 hospital referral regions in the United States. A hospital referral region is a collection of ZIP codes where the hospitals, physicians and specialists in that area provide most of the health care for residents.

The team compared 2019 Medicare dementia diagnoses in people 66 and older in each region with the number of expected new cases in that geographical area based on potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Those risk factors include alcohol consumption, lower levels of education, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking and low social contact.

Known demographic and health risk factors were then removed, leaving the team with a measure of diagnosis intensity that looked different than the traditional view. No longer was all the emphasis on the Southeast; instead, the map showed a picture of diagnosis discrepancies across the nation.

Alaska, Connecticut and the Texas Panhandle, for example, had excellent matches between dementia diagnoses and what might be expected for their areas, according to the study published recently in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia.

Surprisingly, Florida did not.

“Estimates are anywhere from 30% to 40% of people 80 and older have a form of dementia, so you’d assume that Florida, which has a really old Medicare population, would have a higher rate of diagnosis than other areas,” Bynum said. “That’s not what we found.”

Hospital regions also differed widely in the number of newly diagnosed cases of Alzheimer’s or another dementia. One region only diagnosed 1.7% of its older population, the lowest the study found, while another diagnosed the highest number of cases at 5.4%.

The largest disparities were found in people in the youngest age category of 66 to 74 — when lifestyle changes and early-stage Alzheimer’s medications might have the most benefit — and in Black and Hispanic people, who are at much higher risk than White people for Alzheimer’s and other dementias.

“Even within the Black community, you see twofold differences in an individual’s likelihood of getting diagnosed depending on their ZIP code,” Bynum said. “So, it’s not just those group characteristics. There’s something going on.”

Differences between ZIP codes affect all races and social groups, according to the study. Drazen Zigic/iStockphoto/Getty Images

Insurance coverage, stigma and overworked physicians

Even though all patients in the study were on the same insurance plan — Medicare — differences exist between health systems concerning how many hospitals and specialists accept the government’s fee-for-service health insurance program.

“If you live in a city where nearby hospitals do not accept Medicare versus living in a different city where hospitals do accept Medicare, that could explain some of the disparity,” Ighodaro said. “Both patients have Medicare, but they’re getting different access and treatment.”

Even if your local health system does accept Medicare, it doesn’t mean the program will cover the tests necessary to confirm a suspected diagnosis, she added.

“Biomarkers, neuropsychological testing, MRI or PET scans are not always covered by Medicare or even other insurance,” Ighodaro said. “If I, as a neurologist, cannot do these exams and order these tests, it’s going to be difficult for me to make the diagnosis of dementia. Yet without that diagnosis, patients are not eligible for these disease-modifying medications that could add to their quality of life.”

Cognitive decline also carries stigma in some communities and cultures and may have an impact on a person’s work or family relationships, Bynum said. That may leave some doctors — and patients — uneasy about pursuing a diagnosis. Then there’s the issue of teasing out signs of cognitive decline, which can be difficult at times.

“If you think about the older adult who comes in, they have three, four, five chronic conditions and multiple bodily complaints, all of which may impact their cognition,” Bynum said. “I’m a geriatrician in practice, and I can tell you diagnosing cognitive decline is not always straightforward.”

How can people make sure they are given the cognitive tests they require during yearly wellness visits? Be your own advocate, Ighodaro said. Call in advance to find out if a doctor or hospital provides such assessments as part of the visit and keep looking for one that does, she said. Another tip: Call an insurer in advance to determine which types of additional cognitive tests are covered if indeed they are required.

“If one has the slightest concern about their cognition or that of a family member, go get checked out,” Ighodaro said. “It’s better to be reassured by a physician there’s nothing to worry about than wait and not be eligible for these new medications.

“Remember, it’s not the patient’s job to determine ‘Is this dementia or not?’ It’s our job.”"
health,PFAS: Chemicals that are everywhere and could affect your health,2024-09-09,Madeline Holcombe,"There are chemicals in cookware, food, water, clothes and furniture that could cause problems for people’s health.

These PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment — have been used in consumer products since the 1950s.

As more studies and regulations about PFAS are released, Dr. Carmen Marsit has been doing research on the effects of these chemicals during pregnancy. Marsit, Rollins Distinguished Professor of Research at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, wants people to understand what to do about PFAS. Here’s his advice.

This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

CNN: What exactly are PFAS chemicals?

Dr. Carmen Marsit: PFAS are a class of about 15,000 human-made chemicals that contain fluorine groups, which give them special properties. They are in nonstick surfaces; they’re used in firefighting foams, protecting packages from grease, and waterproofing of carpets and your clothing. Because of the structure of these chemicals, they’re able to have these (nonstick, water-repellent and temperature-regulating) properties.

CNN: Should we be worried about them?

Marsit: I definitely think we should be concerned. One — they’re found in pretty much every person in the United States. The data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey has shown that these can be detected in pretty much everyone — and that’s everyone from small children through adults.

We see new data coming out of research that’s telling us that there are good, well-researched links between these types of chemicals and cancers, particularly kidney cancer and testicular cancer. And there is more research going on that could be linking it to other cancers.

PFAS are also linked to various other endocrine-related type conditions, such as menstrual cycle alterations, infertility and thyroid disease. This is anything related to hormones, because these chemicals in their shape also look a little bit like hormones that we have in our body. They are related to things like thyroid dysfunction.

They’ve been linked to lower birth weights when pregnant people are exposed, to some developmental delays in children, and they actually have some immunological effects as well. They touch on a lot of different types of health effects.

We’re concerned because they do have this ability to affect so many different types of organs, and they’re so prevalent in the environment and in people that we worry about their health effects.

CNN: How do people get exposed to PFAS?

Marsit: There are a number of different routes. Water is a common route of exposure — drinking water from your municipal water sources in your home are contaminated with PFAS chemicals.

Food can be another source of exposure, partly because of the packaging that food comes in, (such as) any types of nonstick, risk-proof packaging. A lot of frozen foods and fast foods were put into these types of packaging. A pizza box, for example, will have PFAS on the bottom.

There’s actually some new data suggesting that PFAS are very prevalent in pesticides, and so, in fact, are being sprayed on to foods. Even your fresh foods might be contaminated with some of these chemicals.

You also get them from other types of consumer goods. They’re used in cosmetics and other types of body lotions. They’re in your clothing. Any water-repellent-type clothing is covered with these chemicals, and it could shed from those clothing items, and you can be breathing it in.

They’re also in furniture and on carpets. That tends to be a concern when we think about children, because they play on the floors more often.

CNN: What can be done about it?

Marsit: On the policy side, we are seeing some positive things happening that are going to start to reduce some of these levels.

The (US) Environmental Protection Agency now has a ruling out about at least five of these chemicals in drinking water that basically sets limits for these chemicals in the water. Within three years, municipal water sources have to test these chemicals, and then within five years, they have to have a plan for how to reduce those levels below the EPA-set limits.

Recently, the (US) Food and Drug Administration has worked with food product manufacturers who create the containers of food products to get the PFAS chemicals removed from those containers, so now we’ll see less of that kind of foodborne exposure.

CNN: Does that mean we have to wait on companies or regulations to change? Is there anything individuals can do?

Marsit: People can still take individual actions.

A lot of it is reducing exposures to plastics. Often these are used in coating plastics, and so using reusable water bottles that are metal or glass might be good alternatives.

Look at your consumer products, or any kinds of beauty products or personal products that you might be using, to see if they have any of these chemicals in them and try to reduce the use of some of those products. Or use products where they might have less of these chemicals.

Some manufacturers are starting to be concerned about the health effects as well and are starting to remove them from their products. It’s a slow process, but eventually we’ll see more and more of those manufacturers kind of moving away from the use of these chemicals in their products because of these health effects.

CNN: If someone wants to avoid PFAS in their products, what do they look for?

Marsit: You’re looking for things that say fluoryl. Any kind of chemical that might have fluoryl in it is likely to be one of these types of chemicals. It’s those kind of products you’ll want to avoid.

It’s really only going to be once when people really advocate for themselves — to get away from these chemicals and to have manufacturers stop utilizing these chemicals — that we’re really going to be able to get away from them completely.

There are new ones being created all the time, so we don’t even know all the potential PFAS chemicals that are out there. People avoiding products because of the chemicals says a lot to manufacturers, and that may drive what they do.

CNN: If everyone has been exposed, is there anything we can do to reduce the impacts?

Marsit: A lot of it is following some of the same principles we would follow for any kind of healthy lifestyle. The more you are eating fresh fruits and vegetables, getting exercise, getting your screenings done would all be good steps to make sure that if there are any effects, they might be caught early, and that they can be intervened upon.

We don’t know a lot about how to reverse any effects that may have already occurred from PFAS. There is some research going on to try to understand what we can do to remove some of these from our bodies, or what can we be doing to help to reverse some of the effects."
health,PFAS: Chemicals that are everywhere and could affect your health,2024-09-09,Madeline Holcombe,"There are chemicals in cookware, food, water, clothes and furniture that could cause problems for people’s health.

These PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment — have been used in consumer products since the 1950s.

As more studies and regulations about PFAS are released, Dr. Carmen Marsit has been doing research on the effects of these chemicals during pregnancy. Marsit, Rollins Distinguished Professor of Research at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, wants people to understand what to do about PFAS. Here’s his advice.

This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

CNN: What exactly are PFAS chemicals?

Dr. Carmen Marsit: PFAS are a class of about 15,000 human-made chemicals that contain fluorine groups, which give them special properties. They are in nonstick surfaces; they’re used in firefighting foams, protecting packages from grease, and waterproofing of carpets and your clothing. Because of the structure of these chemicals, they’re able to have these (nonstick, water-repellent and temperature-regulating) properties.

CNN: Should we be worried about them?

Marsit: I definitely think we should be concerned. One — they’re found in pretty much every person in the United States. The data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey has shown that these can be detected in pretty much everyone — and that’s everyone from small children through adults.

We see new data coming out of research that’s telling us that there are good, well-researched links between these types of chemicals and cancers, particularly kidney cancer and testicular cancer. And there is more research going on that could be linking it to other cancers.

PFAS are also linked to various other endocrine-related type conditions, such as menstrual cycle alterations, infertility and thyroid disease. This is anything related to hormones, because these chemicals in their shape also look a little bit like hormones that we have in our body. They are related to things like thyroid dysfunction.

They’ve been linked to lower birth weights when pregnant people are exposed, to some developmental delays in children, and they actually have some immunological effects as well. They touch on a lot of different types of health effects.

We’re concerned because they do have this ability to affect so many different types of organs, and they’re so prevalent in the environment and in people that we worry about their health effects.

CNN: How do people get exposed to PFAS?

Marsit: There are a number of different routes. Water is a common route of exposure — drinking water from your municipal water sources in your home are contaminated with PFAS chemicals.

Food can be another source of exposure, partly because of the packaging that food comes in, (such as) any types of nonstick, risk-proof packaging. A lot of frozen foods and fast foods were put into these types of packaging. A pizza box, for example, will have PFAS on the bottom.

There’s actually some new data suggesting that PFAS are very prevalent in pesticides, and so, in fact, are being sprayed on to foods. Even your fresh foods might be contaminated with some of these chemicals.

You also get them from other types of consumer goods. They’re used in cosmetics and other types of body lotions. They’re in your clothing. Any water-repellent-type clothing is covered with these chemicals, and it could shed from those clothing items, and you can be breathing it in.

They’re also in furniture and on carpets. That tends to be a concern when we think about children, because they play on the floors more often.

CNN: What can be done about it?

Marsit: On the policy side, we are seeing some positive things happening that are going to start to reduce some of these levels.

The (US) Environmental Protection Agency now has a ruling out about at least five of these chemicals in drinking water that basically sets limits for these chemicals in the water. Within three years, municipal water sources have to test these chemicals, and then within five years, they have to have a plan for how to reduce those levels below the EPA-set limits.

Recently, the (US) Food and Drug Administration has worked with food product manufacturers who create the containers of food products to get the PFAS chemicals removed from those containers, so now we’ll see less of that kind of foodborne exposure.

CNN: Does that mean we have to wait on companies or regulations to change? Is there anything individuals can do?

Marsit: People can still take individual actions.

A lot of it is reducing exposures to plastics. Often these are used in coating plastics, and so using reusable water bottles that are metal or glass might be good alternatives.

Look at your consumer products, or any kinds of beauty products or personal products that you might be using, to see if they have any of these chemicals in them and try to reduce the use of some of those products. Or use products where they might have less of these chemicals.

Some manufacturers are starting to be concerned about the health effects as well and are starting to remove them from their products. It’s a slow process, but eventually we’ll see more and more of those manufacturers kind of moving away from the use of these chemicals in their products because of these health effects.

CNN: If someone wants to avoid PFAS in their products, what do they look for?

Marsit: You’re looking for things that say fluoryl. Any kind of chemical that might have fluoryl in it is likely to be one of these types of chemicals. It’s those kind of products you’ll want to avoid.

It’s really only going to be once when people really advocate for themselves — to get away from these chemicals and to have manufacturers stop utilizing these chemicals — that we’re really going to be able to get away from them completely.

health,Analysis: Parents are stressed right now. Here’s what they can do,2024-09-01,Kara Alaimo,"Parents and caregivers are working more hours and spending more time taking care of their children than parents did in the past — all while juggling sign-ups for extracurricular activities, playdates, school forms, doctor appointments and more.

No wonder they’re stressed. And the nation’s top doctor agrees.

US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, a father of two, issued an advisory warning on Wednesday that the pressure that parents are under has become a public health problem. Some 41% of parents reported they can’t function most days because of stress, and 48% said they’re completely overwhelmed by stress, the advisory said, citing a 2023 American Psychological Association survey.

Parents are struggling with the high costs of childcare, education and health care, the advisory warned. They’re straining to find enough time for work, childcare and the mental load of parenting. They’re worried about school shootings and the mental health challenges many children are facing.

They’re also challenged by how to handle kids’ use of social media and their own, because parents are facing an “intensifying culture of comparison” encouraged by social media influencers showing off their supposedly perfect parenting, according to the advisory.

Things are even worse for parents with added stressors, such as those who are single, have children with special needs or have recently divorced.

And if parents are stressed, kids get stressed. Children were twice as likely to have behavioral, developmental or mental disorders and four times likelier to have poor mental health when their primary caregiver had poor mental health, according to a 2021 study.

It’s no surprise that parents’ mental health struggles can hurt our whole society by driving up health care costs and lowering economic productivity, the advisory noted.

“Simply put, caregivers need care, too,” the advisory warned.

How to practice parental self-care

It’s true that lot of these problems require action by lawmakers and employers, and this advisory should serve as a wake-up call to both that health care and childcare should be more affordable and accessible.

In the meantime, what can parents do? Anna Seewald, a psychologist and host of the “Authentic Parenting” podcast, told me parents can make changes to protect their physical and mental health amid all these challenges.

Lower expectations

Our society makes life incredibly hard for parents, the advisory noted, so parents could try to reevaluate their expectations of themselves.

“Parents put a lot of pressure on themselves to always be calm and patient and have well-behaved kids who do a lot of extracurricular activities,” Seewald said, but she noted doing so often isn’t realistic. “High expectations and social comparisons lead to big resentments and frustration.”

It’s better for parents to be realistic about what they can do given their circumstances.

Take stock of how you’re spending your time

Many parents who work with Seewald are spending loads of time on social media. Even deleting a single app can free up a substantial amount of time and energy, she said. “You don’t notice how they drain your time, but that’s a background stressor for a lot of people in a world of many stressors — and it’s one that you can control.”

Parents can also benefit from simplifying their kids’ activities. “You don’t need to go to two different birthday parties for 4-year-olds in a single weekend,” she said. “Preserving and protecting your own energy and time is more important.” If it’s something you’d enjoy, “maybe you hire a babysitter for an hour, maybe you invite a neighbor over for coffee,” she said.

One way for parents to find more time for themselves is to ask for help from the community — such as asking a kind neighbor or family member to watch their kids so they can take a break. Seewald said it’s also important for parents to think through what responsibilities —such as laundry or carpooling — they can delegate to other people.

Connect in person

Part of the time parents devote to themselves needs to include connecting with other people in person, Seewald said. “So many parents feel lonely and isolated. Seeing a friend helps you vent and talk about problems and get the emotional support you need, even if it’s limited and you see one person each week,” she said.

Parents can meet some self-care needs even with their kids around — and with small pockets of time, Seewald said. “If you put on music and dance with your kids and are silly for 10 minutes before you make dinner, your mood changes because of the movement,” she said. “Little interventions like that make a big difference, and they’re free.”

Spending time in nature also helps, she said. “You can go to the backyard or to a park, even if it’s for 15 minutes, even with kids, and feel the sun or watch the sunset. There’s no cost, but it regulates the nervous system and gives you a sense of awe and connects you to something bigger,” she pointed out.

Above all, Seewald recommended that parents practice self-compassion, which means “being kind and gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes, when we yell at our kids,” she said. “Feeling inadequate and shameful is a recipe for failure.”

The surgeon general has made clear that parents in the United States are not OK. While it’s on lawmakers and employers to solve many of these problems, it’s also critical for parents to practice self-care instead of waiting for the problems to be fixed. (That’s going to take awhile). Being kind and realistic with themselves, finding time to connect with friends and nature, and asking for help are all ways to help manage the mother lode of stresses parents are under.

health,"Parents, put down your phones (sometimes)",2024-09-06,Dr. Katie Hurley,"Editor’s note: Dr. Katie Hurley is a child and adolescent psychotherapist, and the author of several books, including “No More Mean Girls: The Secret to Raising Strong, Confident, and Compassionate Girls” and “Fiona McPhee, Please Listen to Me!” She is the parent of two teenagers.

CNN —

While school administrators and parents focus on phone bans in schools as kids head back to school — and rightfully so — we also need to pay attention to the other places where phone use (and overuse) occurs.

As a therapist who works with teenagers, I routinely hear from clients that their parents consistently criticize kids’ phone use but don’t curb their own use. Hypocrisy aside, teens tell me that it’s frustrating when their parents can’t give them their focus. Frustrated with their parents over their lack of attention, teens curb negative emotions by watching videos on social media.

Higher levels of perceived parent digital technology use that interferes with parent-child interactions — referred to as “parental technoference” by the study authors — were associated with higher levels of anxiety, inattention and hyperactivity later in development, according to a new study published in August in JAMA Network Open.

Parents often tell me the same thing — their kids are glued to their phones and don’t listen when they try to engage them. And when parents feel rejected, they also turn their attention to their phones.

In many ways, families get stuck in an endless loop of fractured communication and hurt feelings because technology steals focus.

I try to help families zoom out and look at the problem from both perspectives, and often they are able to see that technology robs them of positive interactions and quality time. I tell parents and kids alike that everyone needs to make changes in their technology habits to restore positive communication and trust. (And note to adults: It’s our job as parents to work on our family dynamics and model good behavior for our kids.)

Before you worry that you must ban phone use completely at home, it’s important to note that the “parental technoference” study deliberately centered on youth voices and did not include parent perceptions. But those results, although not conclusive, can make parents and caregivers more aware of what we do at home.

There’s a lot that can be done to curb “technoference” and restore positive and meaningful conversations within families. And no, you don’t have to throw out your phones or do all these steps at once. Do try to put down your phones (everyone) to sort out some family tech guidelines.

Set family tech guidelines together

Parents often set rules they don’t always intend to follow. Keeping phones out of the bedroom is a common rule among parents of tweens and teens, yet this rule doesn’t often apply to the parents (guilty as charged).

While it’s perfectly logical to adapt the rules by maturity level, it’s also important to include kids in these conversations to increase their understanding about the differences. In my case, my kids know that my phone is in night mode and only family can reach me for emergencies after 9 p.m.

How can we do it? Including your children’s voices in these conversations gives them some agency over learning to use technology in a healthy way in the home. Think about these questions:

● When should we put our phones away at home?

● How can we help each other stay off our phones during family time?

● What system should we use to reduce our phone use (maybe a storage basket or central charging station)?

Practice active listening skills together

It’s natural for push notifications to grab attention when we see our phones light up, and it’s OK if that feels hard to resist. Some of our technology is designed to be addictive. Learning to use technology in moderation, like changing any habits, takes time and practice. Most people will make mistakes along the way.

How can we do it? Focus on these active listening skills at home to practice focused attention:

● Maintain eye contact or look near the person’s face if eye contact is difficult.

● Ask follow-up questions to clarify something.

● Avoid interrupting by holding your thought until the other person is finished speaking.

● Reflect on what you heard.

● Listen to understand, not to respond.

Create communication systems that work

Sometimes parents will need to address work situations as they pop up (a doctor on call, a journalist with a deadline, a government official during a storm), and teens will need to handle notifications from school. (My daughter said situations like notifications from group project text chats and homework deadlines that include a specific time are best addressed right away.)

How we handle these imminent requests matter so that we don’t reject one another or interrupt important points of connection.

● Remain focused until there is a break in the conversation.

● Be certain the request is urgent and needs immediate attention before stepping away.

● Make a follow-up plan to continue the conversation.

● Be clear when you set boundaries around work needs.

Like all things related to technology, learning to use it in a positive way in the home will likely be a work in progress for a while. Try not to be hard on yourselves, or your kids, as new information arises. The best thing families can do is remain flexible and adapt as information is updated.

Make family time together

It’s always a good idea to revisit things your family enjoys doing together that don’t include technology.

● Family game night

● Ice cream sundae bar

● Sunset walks around town

● Playing Mad Libs

By prioritizing having fun together, families can curb tech overuse in a positive way.

You don’t need to do this all at once. Families I work with often find that working on one small goal at a time makes a big difference. Go ahead and plan that weekly family game night; it might just be the tech-free zone you need to reset your family habits.

entertainment,Travis Kelce wants to be a touchdown in Hollywood. Inside his goal of ‘bringing joy to people’,2024-09-10,Alli Rosenbloom,"Travis Kelce really didn’t want to participate in “Catching Kelce,” the 2016 E! reality show in which 50 women – one from each state – vied for the affection of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who was then not a household name.

“Sign me up,” he says in the promo. But it was far from that easy, Aaron Eanes, his manager, told CNN recently.

“People didn’t really look at tight ends as ‘talent’ and so it was more of a situation where it’s like, ‘If you want to be in entertainment, you kind of need to do something that’s unexpected but it’s also going to allow you to learn,” Eanes recalled telling Kelce.

We know now Kelce didn’t find lasting love, but he did get the experience he needed to begin breaking into Hollywood.

Eanes and his twin brother Andre, who also manages Kelce, have known the three-time Super Bowl champ since he was a student at the University of Cincinnati and have helped take Kelce’s commercial career and Hollywood pursuits from reality TV to actual reality. While it has always been an ambitious fear, Eanes said it’s easy to root for Kelce, who hasn’t changed all that much since the early days of their partnership.

“(He) still is the same kind of happy-go-lucky person that just enjoys life… He’s just very grounded in who he is,” Eanes said.

It has been nearly eight years since Kelce appeared on E!, but Eanes said the football star is finally in a place where his Hollywood pursuits are guided by his innate interests.

“Travis is going to do what Travis wants to do,” Eanes said, with a laugh.

As Kelce continues to cement his status as one of the buzziest stars in the NFL, the most-watched show on television, his agents are hard at work setting him up for Hollywood success in the offseason – and his post-football future, whenever that may be.

“We have a lot of other opportunities that keep him excited. So I think ultimately, whenever he decides to stop playing, he’s going to still be plenty busy if he wants to be,” Eanes said.

In the meantime, here’s what Eanes is saying about where Kelce’s been, what he’s up to now and where he’s going in Tinseltown.

‘Moonbase 8’ (2020)

After “Catching Kelce,” Kelce didn’t take on any work off the football field until 2020.

According to Eanes, they wanted to take a beat to recalibrate.

“We wanted to wait for a project that actually was more in the line of what he would want to do, which was scripted comedy and comedy,” Eanes said.

Enter “Moonbase 8,” Showtime and A24’s space comedy that starred Tim Heidecker, Fred Armisen and John C. Reilly. Kelce’s cameo in the pilot episode was short lived, literally, because his character – a satirical version of himself – got killed off about halfway through the episode.

Nonetheless, it was an indispensable experience for Kelce.

Being able to work with Armisen, Heidecker, and Rielly and learn from them on set “gave him another idea of what it would take to be in the business,” Eanes said.

‘New Heights’ podcast (2022)

Kelce has co-hosted the “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce” podcast with his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce, since 2022. Now in it’s third season, the brothers recently inked a multi-million-dollar agreement to bring the podcast to Amazon’s Wondery, a deal that Eanes helped broker.

“We want to make sure we’re great partners,” Eanes said. “We want to make sure we’re doing a good job in delivering value to Wondery and then growing that property.”

Delivering value is just as much of a priority to Kelce as is delivering authenticity, which is easy when you co-host a show with your brother.

The podcast, said Eanes, has “allowed him to be closer with his brother than he’s ever been.”

‘Saturday Night Live’ (2023 and 2024)

Just one month after the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year, Kelce braved the Studio 8H stage to make his hosting debut on “Saturday Night Live.”

It was an emotional moment for Kelce, who said during his monologue that he grew up watching the long-running sketch comedy show with his mother, Donna Kelce.

“And to be standing on this stage, whew,” Kelce said, getting choked up. “Pretty surreal.”

Kelce’s dream of hosting “SNL” harkens back to his love for comedy, according to Eanes.

“He’s a big fan of comedy, he’s a big fan of movies. He’s a big fan of just entertainment and bringing joy to people,” he said. “So whether it’s when you watch him play on the field, or whether you watch him on ‘SNL’ or if you watch him on his podcast, at the end of the day, it’s just a way for him to kind of show off his personality.”

The next time Kelce appeared on “SNL” was in October, appearing in a short cameo alongside his then-new girlfriend Swift.

‘Grotesquerie’ (2024)

Kelce has previously spoken about his love for comedy and how he’s most interested in pursuing roles in the scripted comedy space. So when it was announced that he was cast in “Grotesquerie,” a creepy new thriller from producer Ryan Murphy, it came to some as a bit of a surprise.

“He was excited by the challenge of a drama that he’d never done,” Eanes said of Kelce’s choice to sign on for Murphy’s next nightmare-inducing offering.

The draw was also working with a Hollywood producer like Murphy, who Eanes felt like Kelce was in good hands with because he is “very understanding of new talent and able to kind of have a vision for that person.”

“Because of how involved he is in the process, you can just have an understanding that you’re protected,” he added. “And so you can truly be, I would say, free in a weird way to just experience and do what you need to do.”

‘Are You Smarter than a Celebrity?’ (2024)

In October, viewers will get to see Kelce in his next big hosting gig when “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity” debuts on Prime Video.

Taking on this opportunity was much more sentimental to Kelce than the other gigs.

“He loved game shows growing up,” Eanes said. “So I think that’s more of just being able to live out something that as a child you can see and be like, ‘Oh, I could be a game show host.’ But then fast forward and it actually comes true.”

Kelce has, indeed, spoken about his love for game shows, saying on an episode of “New Heights” that his favorite game shows to watch growing up were “The Price is Right” and “Family Feud.”

“I always wanted to be a part of it, whether I was a contestant, someone helping out or hosting one,” Kelce added.

‘Happy Gilmore 2’

With his podcast, Kelce knows he has a powerful platform. So when he spent time talking about wanting to be in Adam Sandler’s upcoming “Happy Gilmore” sequel, Sandler heard Kelce loud and clear.

In fact, Kelce and Sandler are the ones who initiated his cameo in “Happy Gilmore 2.”

“He talked to Sandler,” Eanes said, with a laugh, adding that Kelce called him after he’d agreed to be in the movie.

Like many, Eanes said that Kelce has always been a fan of Sandler’s films growing up so he was “extremely humbled” to connect with Sandler about being in the sequel, something Eanes said that Kelce considers to be a “dream come true.”

Sandler is returning to star in and co-write the long-awaited sequel to the 1996 golf comedy, which is set to stream on Netflix. A premiere date has not yet been announced.

“We’re gonna have fun because the scene you’re doing is with so many great golfers. It’s going to be amazing,” Sandler told Kelce while appearing on a recent episode of “New Heights.” “You’re going to be funny as hell.”

Turned out, reality TV was the running start Kelce needed after all. But, Eanes joked, he has no plans to return to it.

“You don’t really need a show to see what he’s doing all the time.”"
entertainment,Travis Kelce wants to be a touchdown in Hollywood. Inside his goal of ‘bringing joy to people’,2024-09-10,Alli Rosenbloom,"Travis Kelce really didn’t want to participate in “Catching Kelce,” the 2016 E! reality show in which 50 women – one from each state – vied for the affection of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who was then not a household name.

“Sign me up,” he says in the promo. But it was far from that easy, Aaron Eanes, his manager, told CNN recently.

“People didn’t really look at tight ends as ‘talent’ and so it was more of a situation where it’s like, ‘If you want to be in entertainment, you kind of need to do something that’s unexpected but it’s also going to allow you to learn,” Eanes recalled telling Kelce.

We know now Kelce didn’t find lasting love, but he did get the experience he needed to begin breaking into Hollywood.

Eanes and his twin brother Andre, who also manages Kelce, have known the three-time Super Bowl champ since he was a student at the University of Cincinnati and have helped take Kelce’s commercial career and Hollywood pursuits from reality TV to actual reality. While it has always been an ambitious fear, Eanes said it’s easy to root for Kelce, who hasn’t changed all that much since the early days of their partnership.

“(He) still is the same kind of happy-go-lucky person that just enjoys life… He’s just very grounded in who he is,” Eanes said.

It has been nearly eight years since Kelce appeared on E!, but Eanes said the football star is finally in a place where his Hollywood pursuits are guided by his innate interests.

“Travis is going to do what Travis wants to do,” Eanes said, with a laugh.

As Kelce continues to cement his status as one of the buzziest stars in the NFL, the most-watched show on television, his agents are hard at work setting him up for Hollywood success in the offseason – and his post-football future, whenever that may be.

“We have a lot of other opportunities that keep him excited. So I think ultimately, whenever he decides to stop playing, he’s going to still be plenty busy if he wants to be,” Eanes said.

In the meantime, here’s what Eanes is saying about where Kelce’s been, what he’s up to now and where he’s going in Tinseltown.

‘Moonbase 8’ (2020)

After “Catching Kelce,” Kelce didn’t take on any work off the football field until 2020.

Padilla has been a member of the Main Company of the esteemed improv troupe The Groundlings since 2021 and has also appeared in “Night Court” and “Curb Your Enthusiam.”

Wakim, who is Lebanese-American, was selected as the New Face of Comedy at the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in 2022, which is the same year that he made his debut on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”

Wickline came to fame by building a fan base on TikTok, where she is a cast member of the show “Stapleview.” She can also be seen in the 2024 Mubi movie “My First Film,” as well as on tour with her comedy.

While “SNL” is growing its cast, current cast member Chloe Troast shared on social media that she will not be returning for the new season.

“Unfortunately I was not asked back to SNL this season,” Troast wrote. “I wish I was going back to be with all the amazing friends I made there, it truly felt like home. But it wasn’t in the cards.”

entertainment,Bruce Springsteen’s wife Patti Scialfa says she was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2018,2024-09-09,Sandra Gonzalez,"Patti Scialfa, a member of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band and the legendary rocker’s wife, reveals in a new documentary that she was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer in 2018.

Scialfa, who didn’t attend Sunday’s premiere of “Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band” at the Toronto Film Festival, has not previously addressed her health battle, which she says in the film has taken her away from touring.

“This affects my immune system, so I have to be careful what I choose to do and where I choose to go,” she said in the film, according to Variety, who had a reporter in attendance. “Every once in a while, I come to a show or two and I can sing a few songs on stage, and that’s been a treat. That’s the new normal for me right now, and I’m OK with that.”

Scialfa identified her cancer as multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer that doesn’t always require immediate treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic.

“If the multiple myeloma is slow growing and isn’t causing symptoms, close watching might be the first step. For people with multiple myeloma who need treatment, there are a number of ways to help control the disease,” the organization’s website states.

A representative for Scialfa had no further information when reached by CNN for comment.

Springsteen has been beset with his own health challenges.

Last year, he postponed some tour dates as he sought to “recover steadily from peptic ulcer disease over the past few weeks,” adding that he was set to “continue treatment through the rest of the year on doctor’s advice.”

Scialfa has been a member of the E Street Band since 1984 and married to Springsteen since 1991. The couple has three children.

“Road Diary” was directed by Thom Zimny, who previously helmed other projects for Springsteen and Co., including “Springsteen on Broadway” and “Western Stars.”"

entertainment,Selena Gomez shares how ongoing ‘medical issues’ will shape her path to becoming a parent,2024-09-09,Alli Rosenbloom,"Selena Gomez is speaking candidly about what her path to parenthood may look like.

The “Only Murders in the Building” actress and singer, who has previously been open about both her mental and physical health struggles, opened up for the first time about how her fertility has been impacted by her diagnoses in an interview with Vanity Fair published on Monday.

“I unfortunately can’t carry my own children. I have a lot of medical issues that would put my life and the baby’s in jeopardy. That was something I had to grieve for a while,” Gomez said.

Gomez said that surrogacy and adoption are “huge possibilities” for her and acknowledged how much she considers it a “blessing that there are wonderful people willing” to do both.

“It’s not necessarily the way I envisioned it. I thought it would happen the way it happens for everyone. (But) I’m in a much better place with that,” said Gomez. “It made me really thankful for the other outlets for people who are dying to be moms. I’m one of those people. I’m excited for what that journey will look like, but it’ll look a little different.”

At the end of the day, she said, it doesn’t matter how it happens because “it’ll be mine. It’ll be my baby.”

Gomez revealed in 2015 that she was diagnosed with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation and pain in any part of your body, causing the body to attack healthy tissue, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.

In 2017, Gomez shared that the condition led to her undergo a kidney transplant, donated by her friend, actress Francia Raisa. In 2020, she also shared that she was also diagnosed as bipolar.

Gomez chronicled her health struggles in her 2022 documentary “My Mind & Me.”"

entertainment,"James Earl Jones, iconic voice of Darth Vader in ‘Star Wars’ and Mufasa in ‘The Lion King,’ dead at 93",2024-09-09,"Brandon Griggs, Alli Rosenbloom","You can’t think of James Earl Jones without hearing his voice.

That booming basso profundo, conveying instant dignity or menace, was Jones’ signature instrument. It brought power to all his stage and movie roles, most indelibly as Darth Vader in “Star Wars,” Mufasa in “The Lion King” and as the voice of CNN.

That remarkable voice is just one of many things the world will miss about the beloved actor, who died Monday, according to his agent. He was 93.

Jones was surrounded by his family when he died, his representative said. No cause of death was shared.

“From the gentle wisdom of Mufasa to the menacing threat of Darth Vader, James Earl Jones gave voice to some of the greatest characters in cinema history,” said Bob Iger, chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, in a statement. “A celebrated stage actor with nearly 200 film and television credits to his name, the stories he brought to life with a uniquely commanding presence and a true richness of spirit have left an indelible mark on generations of audiences.”

Jones had a distinguished career that spanned some 60 years and took him from a small-town theater in northern Michigan to the highest reaches of Hollywood.

Voicing Darth Vader

In the mid-1970s “Star Wars” creator George Lucas cast towering British actor David Prowse as the guy inside Darth Vader’s black suit, but decided he wanted someone else to voice the character.

“George thought he wanted a – pardon the expression – darker voice,” Jones once told the American Film Institute. “I lucked out.”

Back then nobody imagined “Star Wars” would become a blockbuster, let alone an enduring franchise and cultural phenomenon. Jones recorded all his lines in a few hours and was not listed in the film’s credits. He said he was paid just $7,000 for the movie, “and I thought that was good money.”

The actor and Lucas had disagreements about how he should voice the villainous Vader.

“I wanted to make Darth Vader more interesting, more subtle, more psychologically oriented,” Jones said. “He (Lucas) said, ‘No, no … you’ve got to keep his voice on a very narrow band of inflection, ‘cause he ain’t human.”

Darth Vader’s climactic duel with Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, in 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back” became a dramatic high point in the “Star Wars” series – punctuated by Jones’ delivery of one of the most famous lines in movie history: “No, I am your father!”

Hamill issued a statement on Monday, writing on Instagram: “One of the world’s finest actors whose contributions to ‘Star Wars’ were immeasurable. He’ll be greatly missed. #RIP dad.”

Jones said that almost two decades later, when he was voicing the dignified Mufasa for Disney’s animated “The Lion King,” it took him a while to strike the right tone.

“My first mistake was to try and make him regal,” Jones said of the 1994 film. “And what they really needed was something more like me. “They said, ‘What are you like as a father?’ and I said, ‘Well, I’m really a dopey dad.’”

He continued: “And so they began to impose my facial expressions onto Mufasa, and a different tone of voice. Yeah, he was authoritative, but he was just a gentle dad.”

A prolific career

Jones was born in 1931 in Mississippi. His father, Robert Earl Jones, left the family before James was born to become an actor in New York and Hollywood, working with playwright Langston Hughes and eventually earning supporting roles in hit movies including “The Sting.”

Jones’ family moved from Mississippi to Michigan when he was 5, a traumatic upheaval that caused him to develop a stutter. His fear of speaking rendered him almost mute until he got to high school, where a poetry teacher helped him overcome his disability by encouraging him to read his poems aloud.

“He began to challenge me, to nudge me toward speaking again … toward acknowledging and appreciating the beauty of words,” Jones said.

Jones studied drama at the University of Michigan, served as an Army Ranger and then moved to New York, where he soon landed lead roles in Shakespearean stage productions. He made his film debut in 1964 as a bombardier in Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove.”

In 1967, Jones was cast as troubled boxer Jack Johnson in a theatrical production of “The Great White Hope,” a career-changing role that won him a Tony. He reprised the role three years later in the film adaptation, becoming only the second African American man, after Sidney Poitier, to be nominated for an Academy Award.

By the mid-1970s Jones was working steadily in movies and TV – a prolific run that never slowed. Over the next five decades he appeared in many memorable roles: As Alex Haley in TV’s “Roots: The Next Generations,” warlord Thulsa Doom in “Conan the Barbarian,” an African king in “Coming to America,” Kevin Costner’s reluctant recruit in “Field of Dreams,” Admiral Greer in “The Hunt for Red October” and “Patriot Games” and a South African preacher in “Cry, the Beloved Country.”

On Monday, Costner recalled Jones’ “booming voice,” “quiet strength” and “the kindness that he radiated” in a statement on Instagram.

“So much can be said about his legacy, so I’ll just say how thankful I am that part of it includes ‘Field of Dreams.’ If you’ve seen it, you know that this movie wouldn’t be the same with anyone else in his role,” he wrote. “Only he could bring that kind of magic to a movie about baseball and a corn field in Iowa. I’m grateful to have been a witness to him making that magic happen.”

Jones continued to work into his later years.

In 2021, Jones reprised his role as King Jaffe Joffer in “Coming 2 America,” the long-awaited sequel to the 1988 classic. His final credit, according to IMDb, was voicing Darth Vader in the 2022 Disney+ mini series “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”

The power of speech

In 2019, he again voiced Mufasa in Disney’s remake of “The Lion King,” becoming the only cast member to reprise his role from the first film.

Over the years, he also guest-starred in dozens of TV series, from “L.A. Law” to “Sesame Street,” appeared regularly on the stage and lent his deep, rumbling voice to everything from “The Simpsons” to a popular audio recording of the King James version of the Bible.

Jones said people in public sometimes didn’t recognize him until they heard his voice.

“When you don’t talk it’s like going ninja,” he told Rachael Ray in 2016. “You get in the taxi and say where you’re going and the guy turns around and says, ‘Hey, aren’t you that Darth Vader guy?’”

He also lent his voice to CNN’s tagline, “This is CNN,” complete with a dramatic pause after “This …”

A CNN spokesperson said in a statement on Monday that Jones “was the voice of CNN and our brand for many decades, uniquely conveying through speech instant authority, grace, and decorum.”

“That remarkable voice is just one of many things the world will miss about James,” the statement added.

Over his long and prolific career Jones won three Tonys, two Emmys, a Grammy, a Golden Globe and numerous other awards.

“It wasn’t acting. It was language. It was speech,” he said when asked what aroused his passion for acting. “It was the thing that I’d … denied myself all those years (as a boy). I now had a great — an abnormal — appreciation for it.

“And it was the idea that you can do a play — like a Shakespeare play, or any well-written play, Arthur Miller, whatever — and say things you could never imagine saying, never imagine thinking in your own life,” he told the Academy of Achievement in 1996.

“You could say these things! That’s what it’s still about, whether it’s the movies or TV or what. That what it’s still about.”

Darth Vader’s climactic duel with Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, in 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back” became a dramatic high point in the “Star Wars” series – punctuated by Jones’ delivery of one of the most famous lines in movie history: “No, I am your father!”

Hamill issued a statement on Monday, writing on Instagram: “One of the world’s finest actors whose contributions to ‘Star Wars’ were immeasurable. He’ll be greatly missed. #RIP dad.”

Jones said that almost two decades later, when he was voicing the dignified Mufasa for Disney’s animated “The Lion King,” it took him a while to strike the right tone.

“My first mistake was to try and make him regal,” Jones said of the 1994 film. “And what they really needed was something more like me. “They said, ‘What are you like as a father?’ and I said, ‘Well, I’m really a dopey dad.’”

He continued: “And so they began to impose my facial expressions onto Mufasa, and a different tone of voice. Yeah, he was authoritative, but he was just a gentle dad.”

A prolific career

Jones was born in 1931 in Mississippi. His father, Robert Earl Jones, left the family before James was born to become an actor in New York and Hollywood, working with playwright Langston Hughes and eventually earning supporting roles in hit movies including “The Sting.”

Jones’ family moved from Mississippi to Michigan when he was 5, a traumatic upheaval that caused him to develop a stutter. His fear of speaking rendered him almost mute until he got to high school, where a poetry teacher helped him overcome his disability by encouraging him to read his poems aloud.

“He began to challenge me, to nudge me toward speaking again … toward acknowledging and appreciating the beauty of words,” Jones said.

Jones studied drama at the University of Michigan, served as an Army Ranger and then moved to New York, where he soon landed lead roles in Shakespearean stage productions. He made his film debut in 1964 as a bombardier in Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove.”

In 1967, Jones was cast as troubled boxer Jack Johnson in a theatrical production of “The Great White Hope,” a career-changing role that won him a Tony. He reprised the role three years later in the film adaptation, becoming only the second African American man, after Sidney Poitier, to be nominated for an Academy Award.

By the mid-1970s Jones was working steadily in movies and TV – a prolific run that never slowed. Over the next five decades he appeared in many memorable roles: As Alex Haley in TV’s “Roots: The Next Generations,” warlord Thulsa Doom in “Conan the Barbarian,” an African king in “Coming to America,” Kevin Costner’s reluctant recruit in “Field of Dreams,” Admiral Greer in “The Hunt for Red October” and “Patriot Games” and a South African preacher in “Cry, the Beloved Country.”

On Monday, Costner recalled Jones’ “booming voice,” “quiet strength” and “the kindness that he radiated” in a statement on Instagram.

“So much can be said about his legacy, so I’ll just say how thankful I am that part of it includes ‘Field of Dreams.’ If you’ve seen it, you know that this movie wouldn’t be the same with anyone else in his role,” he wrote. “Only he could bring that kind of magic to a movie about baseball and a corn field in Iowa. I’m grateful to have been a witness to him making that magic happen.”

Jones continued to work into his later years.

In 2021, Jones reprised his role as King Jaffe Joffer in “Coming 2 America,” the long-awaited sequel to the 1988 classic. His final credit, according to IMDb, was voicing Darth Vader in the 2022 Disney+ mini series “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”

The power of speech

In 2019, he again voiced Mufasa in Disney’s remake of “The Lion King,” becoming the only cast member to reprise his role from the first film.

Over the years, he also guest-starred in dozens of TV series, from “L.A. Law” to “Sesame Street,” appeared regularly on the stage and lent his deep, rumbling voice to everything from “The Simpsons” to a popular audio recording of the King James version of the Bible.

Jones said people in public sometimes didn’t recognize him until they heard his voice.

“When you don’t talk it’s like going ninja,” he told Rachael Ray in 2016. “You get in the taxi and say where you’re going and the guy turns around and says, ‘Hey, aren’t you that Darth Vader guy?’”

He also lent his voice to CNN’s tagline, “This is CNN,” complete with a dramatic pause after “This …”

A CNN spokesperson said in a statement on Monday that Jones “was the voice of CNN and our brand for many decades, uniquely conveying through speech instant authority, grace, and decorum.”

“That remarkable voice is just one of many things the world will miss about James,” the statement added.

Over his long and prolific career Jones won three Tonys, two Emmys, a Grammy, a Golden Globe and numerous other awards.

“It wasn’t acting. It was language. It was speech,” he said when asked what aroused his passion for acting. “It was the thing that I’d … denied myself all those years (as a boy). I now had a great — an abnormal — appreciation for it.

“And it was the idea that you can do a play — like a Shakespeare play, or any well-written play, Arthur Miller, whatever — and say things you could never imagine saying, never imagine thinking in your own life,” he told the Academy of Achievement in 1996.

“You could say these things! That’s what it’s still about, whether it’s the movies or TV or what. That what it’s still about.”

entertainment,Kendrick Lamar’s wordsmith journey to Super Bowl halftime headliner,2024-09-09,Lisa Respers France,"Now might be a good time to check on Drake as Kendrick Lamar appears to have executed a checkmate-move in what has been an historic hip-hop feud between the two artists.

Here’s the backstory: the two battled back and forth earlier this year in a well-documented rap battle that Lamar is widely viewed to have won through his searing verses about Drake. The Canadian artist may have rapped that he was as “Big as the Super Bowl,” but it was the Compton-native Lamar who was announced as the headline act for the next Super Bowl.

It’s just the latest historic achievement for the artist lovingly known as K.Dot.

A rough start

Three years before he was born Kendrick Lamar Duckworth, his parents Kenny Duckworth and Paula Oliver left Chicago for California in search of a better life.

“They were going to go to San Bernardino,” Lamar told Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. “But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got ’em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonald’s.”

According to their son, the couple initially struggled to find their footing in Southern California, sleeping in motels, their car and sometimes a local park.

“Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and that’s when they had me.” Lamar recalled.

Growing up in Compton at the time was far from idyllic.

The younger Lamar has talked about witnessing his first murder at the age of five, when an alleged drug dealer was killed in front of the apartment complex where Lamar and his family lived. Three years later, he witnessed another murder, he has said, at a local restaurant.

“Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary,” Lamar recalled. “Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom — smoked him.”

He was just a preschooler, but Lamar has said he has memories of when the city burned because of the 1992 South Central riots, which occurred after a jury acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department officers of most charges related to the beating of Rodney King.

But there were good times and strong community ties. Lamar remembers spending time with friends, cruising around on bikes and house parties his parents would throw.

Turning pain into poetry

It was exposure to it all that led Lamar to start writing rhymes as a precocious youngster whose intelligence, curiosity and early maturity led his parents to nickname him “Man Man.”

He was one of the spectators when Dr. Dre and 2Pac filmed a video for their hit single “California Love” in Lamar’s neighborhood, citing the impression the two rap superstars made as they filmed the video.

“These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the passenger seat, like, ‘Yo, what the f**k!’,” Lamar told the publication, laughing at the memory. “Yelling at the police, just like on his motherf**king songs. He gave us what we wanted.”

Despite having a stutter as a child, Lamar fell in love with words and language. His seventh grade English teacher, Mr. Inge, introduced him to poetry. Writing gave Lamar a means of expressing his innermost thoughts, even if he wasn’t always secure enough to share them.

In 2022, he talked to W about how the seeds of his then new album “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” were “stuff that I’ve written that’s just now seeing daylight, because I wasn’t secure with myself in order to do it…. It was really about not being insecure [or] tormented by opinions.”

“When I did this, it was kind of the marker and the growth of everything I’ve always wanted to say,” he said. “I think that was really my purpose of writing my way out of things that I was feeling, from the time I was 9 years old, all the way up to 35.”

The birth of K. Dot

While in high school, Lamar began releasing music under the moniker of K.Dot.

He was still a teen when he signed with Top Dawg Entertainment in 2005, where he would go on to co-found the super group Black Hippy, which included fellow West Coast rappers Ab-Soul, Jay Rock and ScHoolboy Q.

But it wasn’t until 2011 that he released his debut album “Section.80.” That success led him to connect with Dr. Dre and Lamar’s sophomore album, the critically acclaimed “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,” was released in 2012 under the artist name Kendrick Lamar.

Thus began the rise with more acclaimed albums, including 2015’s funk and jazz influenced “To Pimp a Butterfly, ” pop-flavored “Damn” in 2017 and his double album “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” in 2022.

“Damn” helped him make history in 2018 when he became the first rap artist to ever win a Pulitzer Prize after the Pulitzer board deemed it “a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life.”

Over the years both Lamar’s attitudes and art have shifted even as he has garned 17 Grammys.

“A lot of times, I’m doing interviews and speaking on the general basis of my childhood, and years later, I see them questions reoccur—maybe on social media, and they pop up and me answering the questions—and I’m like, Damn, the answer was true, but it’s not how I think about it [anymore],” he told W in 2022. “I had to damn near repattern my thoughts to see things that I didn’t necessarily see in those interviews, or just in life in general.”

His ability to grow and change has also let to a variety of collaborations with everyone from Beyoncé to Taylor Swift.

Yet it was his work with fellow rappers which led to one of the most prodigious rap beefs of all time.

Taking on Drizzy

Back in 2011, Lamar appeared on Drake’s second album “Take Care” on “Buried Alive Interlude.” It was the same year Lamar released his debut studio album “Section.80.”

The two men were still carving places for themselves in the industry, with Drake then best known as an actor for his role as student Jimmy Brooks in the Canadian teen TV series, “Degrassi.”

The pair would go on to tour together and collaborate on the track “Poetic Justice” on Lamar’s sophomore studio album, “Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City.”

But their collaborations cooled.

As one of hip-hop’s rising stars, Lamar leaned into his growing success with the swagger one would expect in the rap game during a guest appearance on Big Sean’s 2013 single, “Control.”

Multiple artists are name-checked in the song, including Drake. The lyrics include, “I got love for you all but I’m tryna murder you,” a euphemism for besting them professionally. Lamar proclaims himself both “King of New York” and “King of the Coast.”

“I didn’t really have anything to say about it,” Drake told Billboard of the verse.

“It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That’s all it was,” Drake said at the time. “I know good and well that Kendrick’s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.”

Lamar and Drake continued to take shots at each on various songs until October 2023, when rapper J. Cole collaborated with Drake on the song, “First Person Shooter.” On the track, Cole refers to himself, Lamar and Drake as the “Big three” in rap. Drake likened his own popularity in the game to the stardom of the late singer Michael Jackson.

Lamar seemingly took exception to the comparisons and hit back on a collaborative track with Future and Metro Boomin that caught fire in March 2024, titled “Like That.” Lamar makes clear on the song that there is no “Big three” just “Big me.” He casts himself as Prince to Drake’s Jackson, noting that the former outlived the latter.

“Like That” is a cut on the album “We Don’t Trust You,” which many believe is filled with disses aimed at Drake.

In response Cole released “7 Minute Drill” on a surprise project “Might Delete Later” in which he came after Lamar, only to later declare the song lame. He removed it from streaming services, publicly apologized and since distanced himself from the situation.

Drake, however, leaned in, dropping the diss track “Push Ups” in which he poked fun at Lamar’s shoe size and his past collaborations with pop stars.

“Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,” Drake raps, appearing to mock Lamar’s work with Maroon 5 on their song “Don’t Wanna Know” and with Swift on her song “Bad Blood.”

Lamar responded with multiple diss tracks aimed at Drake, who fans refer to as Drizzy.

First there was “Euphoria,” which is now as famous for the insults lobbed at Drake as it is for making the general public aware that the rapper was also an executive producer on the hit HBO drama. (HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company.) Lamar followed that with “6:16 in LA,” which many interpreted to be making fun of Drake’s penchant for titling songs with times and locations.

Drake got even more personal with the eight-minute diss track, “Family Matters.” He makes allegations about abuse and infidelity involving Lamar and his fiancée, Whitney Alford, on the song.

Not to be outdone, Lamar didn’t even let an hour go by after the release of “Family Matters” to drop a response, titled “Meet The Grahams.” (Drake’s legal name is Aubrey Graham.)

The song gets heavy as Lamar addresses Drake’s parents and Drake’s parenting, suggesting he had a secret child. Lamar followed that within hours with another song, titled “Not Like Us.”

Drake countered with “The Heart Part 6” in which he claims he’s the one who fed Lamar fake information about a secret child.

“We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that’s 11 years old, I bet he takes it,” Drake raps.

That volley barely made a ripple in the rap battle because “Not Like Us” went on to become arguably the song of the summer, breaking streaming records and sitting atop the charts.

The video for the song contained several digs at Drake, including an appearance by Lamar’s fiancée and their two young children to counter the narrative presented by Drake in “Family Matters.”

It also paid homage visually to Lamar’s beloved Compton, the neighborhood which is sure to be even more proud of their native son when he takes to the Super Bowl halftime stage in New Orleans in February 2025."
entertainment,Harvey Weinstein ‘rushed’ to hospital for heart surgery,2024-09-09,"Elizabeth Wagmeister, Lauren Del Valle, Jean Casarez","Harvey Weinstein was “rushed” to Bellevue Hospital in New York on Sunday night “due to several medical conditions,” according to representatives for the disgraced former movie producer.

“We can confirm that Mr. Weinstein had a procedure and surgery on his heart today,” Weinstein’s spokesman Juda Engelmayer and prison consultant Craig Rothfeld said in a statement to CNN on Monday.

“As we have extensively stated before, Mr. Weinstein suffers a plethora of significant health issues that need ongoing treatment,” they added.

A source familiar with the circumstances of the hospitalization said the surgical procedure was completed. Weinstein’s scheduled court appearance for Thursday is still set to occur unless a physician instructs him otherwise, the individual said.

In the event he cannot appear in person, the hearing could be delayed.

Weinstein’s defense counsel was notified in mid-August that a New York grand jury was considering evidence related to sexual assault allegations against the disgraced movie mogul. It is unclear if the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has secured a new indictment.

Weinstein has experienced a number of health problems in recent years and has appeared in court in a wheelchair.

Weinstein, 72, was convicted in 2020 of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison, but his conviction was overturned on appeal in April.

He remains in prison in New York while he appeals a separate 2022 conviction in Los Angeles, where he was found guilty on three sexual assault charges and sentenced to 16 years in prison."
entertainment,Kathy Bates says ‘Matlock’ will be her ‘last dance’ as she plans to retire from acting,2024-09-09,Lisa Respers France,"Kathy Bates says starring in the reboot of the procedural drama “Matlock” will be her swan song.

In an interview with the New York Times, the Oscar-winning actress said she was ready to step out of the spotlight but was drawn to the series after she read the script. Viewers will have to enjoy it, as Bates said this will be her final acting gig.

“This is my last dance,” she told the publication.

Bates, who in 1991 won a best actress Academy Award for her role in the horror thriller “Misery,” talked about her longstanding career in Hollywood and how the new TV series lured her away from her plans to quit the industry.

“Everything I’ve prayed for, worked for, clawed my way up for, I am suddenly able to be asked to use all of it,” the 76-year-old actress said. “And it’s exhausting.”

She was pretty forthright in her interview with the Times, talking about being born the youngest of three daughters with her sisters being much older.

“As I got older, I realized that I wasn’t meant to be,” Bates said. “That has informed my evolution as a human being, and who you are as a human being, it’s who you are as an artist.”

Her performance as Annie Wilkes, a psychotic recluse who kidnaps a famous writer in “Misery,” took her career to a new level.

But Bates couldn’t quite enjoy it.

“I never felt dressed right or well,” she said about the publicity rounds she made for the film and after. “I felt like a misfit. It’s that line in ‘Misery’ when Annie says, ‘I’m not a movie star.’ I’m not.”

Bates has also found success on the small screen with roles on shows like “Six Feet Under,” “The Office” and more recently “American Horror Story.”

Rebooting “Matlock,” which originally starred Andy Griffith as genial Atlanta attorney Ben Matlock and ran from 1986 to 1995, offered Bates the opportunity to explore a world from the perspective of an older woman with her character, Madeline “Matty” Matlock.

“There’s this funny thing that happens when women age,” Bates’s character says in the “Matlock” pilot. “We become damn near invisible.”

“It’s useful, because nobody sees us coming,” she adds.

“Matlock” premieres September 22 on CBS."

entertainment,Don’t Tell Comedy is changing stand-up. Comics say that’s a good thing,2024-09-08,Leah Asmelash,"A year ago, Lea’h Sampson felt like everything was crashing.

Though she had been doing stand-up comedy for six years, she was hitting a wall. Her jokes weren’t getting her booked, even in local comedy shows, and the feeling of defeat was settling in.

So when she got booked to do a show with Don’t Tell Comedy in Los Angeles, it was supposed to be her last. Sure, maybe she’d do a set here or there. But as far as pursuing stand-up full time? She was over it.

Then, Don’t Tell Comedy posted her full set on YouTube, along with a clip on TikTok, a minute-long bit about interracial dating. If you’re on the internet, you might have seen it. She starts with a bang: “Those of you who are into interracial dating, good for you. So was Thomas Jefferson.”

The crowd erupts, and she keeps them in the palm of her hand as she jokes about the differences in dating Black men (“I take my wig off in front of him, he’s like ‘Ooh, brr, it’s cold Little Bill’”) versus White men (“He’s like…’You could’ve told me that you have cancer’”).

That single TikTok video quickly blew up on the platform, bringing in upwards of 4 million views. Meanwhile, more than 800,000 people have seen the full 10-minute set on YouTube.

Overnight, her Instagram follower count doubled (now, she’s at 89,000). Her favorite reality stars left comments on the video. Comedy legends were sliding into her DMs. A few months later, she opened for Bill Burr at Madison Square Garden. She gets emotional talking about it now.

“I feel like I’ve always been a really good comic, a hard worker, and I just needed people to see me,” Sampson said. “And Don’t Tell did that for me.”

Don’t Tell Comedy is different from your average comedy show. Audiences don’t know the exact location until day of, or the lineup they’re going to see. There’s no drink minimum, which makes shows more affordable, and some events are even BYOB. And they’re popular: At a recent show in Atlanta, 149 people packed into a basement boxing gym to see seven local comedians perform.

For comics throughout the country, Don’t Tell creates more opportunities to perform outside of big city hubs. And, as Sampson can attest, Don’t Tell Comedy’s online presence is tremendous — with 5.2 million followers across YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.

Sampson is just one of dozens of comics who has found success through Don’t Tell Comedy. Since its start in 2017, comics say Don’t Tell has changed the comedy landscape for the better.

What is Don’t Tell Comedy?

One of the most influential things that Don’t Tell does, is actually quite simple: It gives comedians a platform, especially online.

Rather than hoping a clip posted on TikTok blows up, Don’t Tell gives comedians access to a built-in audience on social media, a rarity in today’s changing media landscape. One of its millions of followers might see someone’s clip, like it, follow the comedian, and later, buy tickets to their tour. When trying to build a fan base, that’s a huge win.

After all, it’s something of a weird moment for stand-up comedy. On one hand, while traditional industry pathways have shrunk, streaming services — most notably Netflix — have invested heavily in promoting and producing stand-up specials.

But the people who get opportunities on Netflix tend to be big names, said Don’t Tell founder and CEO Kyle Kazanjian-Amory. (These include comedians like John Mulaney, Dave Chapelle, or more recently, Joe Rogan, whose special premiered last month.) There’s a gap, one that Don’t Tell tries to fill, between mainstream comedians with big fan bases and those without.

“That’s the tough thing in comedy,” Kazanjian-Amory said. “You’re either living in a multimillion dollar house, or you’re scraping by to pay rent.”

That disparity wasn’t always the norm. Back in the 1980s, clubs were desperate for comedians to fill time slots in their venues. There were more spaces than comedians to fill them, said Jesse David Fox, a comedy critic and author of “Comedy Book.” That meant comedians could largely make a middle-class living doing stand-up in their own cities.

Eventually, some of those stars broke through, becoming names many of us still recognize, like Jerry Seinfeld or Ellen DeGeneres. But even if you weren’t a megastar, Fox said, that middle class lifestyle was still attainable.

A decade later, that 1980s comedy boom busted. In the 1990s, fewer venues meant there were fewer places for comedians to make money without already being famous. The definition of success changed: With a reduced path to the middle-class level of comedy, comedians hoped to build enough momentum to pitch a sitcom — à la Ray Romano or, later, Chris Rock.

This type of top-down level success continued into the 2000s. Comedy gatekeepers — like late night shows and Comedy Central — determined whether a comedian was funny enough to give them a platform, Fox said. Maybe they’d give a rising star a 10-minute set, then a half-hour special, then an hour, then maybe a development deal for a show. (Think Amy Schumer and Nick Kroll).

Now, in most cases, that whole pathway to make money has flipped. Comedians have to develop and nurture their fan bases through other avenues — like a popular podcast or newsletter — so fans will buy tickets to see them perform. Previous platforms have lost power; in their place is a more grassroots effort driven by social media like TikTok, Instagram reels and YouTube.

But the idea of a comedian having fans is a relatively recent one, Fox said. Sure, someone like Seinfeld could sell out arenas and have fans that will pay to see him perform. But for most working comics, they were just the name on the bill on a Friday night at the comedy club. Until now.

“All of it has allowed comedians of many levels to build fan bases,” Fox said. “And from those fan bases, you have a sustainable income because they’re your fans. It’s much more sustainable than the whims of certain gatekeepers.”

Comedians say Don’t Tell ‘set the bar’

Grace Johnson has been doing comedy since 2021. After meeting Kazanjian-Amory last year at the New York Comedy Festival, Don’t Tell Comedy produced and released her 10-minute special in June. While the special did give her a boost online, Johnson said that just having the credit was meaningful.

“Don’t Tell right now stands out as one of the premier places to go to for comedy, in the way that Comedy Central has been,” Johnson said. “Especially as someone who has been doing it for a shorter time than others, it’s been a really legitimizing thing.”

There are other tangible effects, too. Don’t Tell gives its comedians a “crisp, nice-looking video” that can then be used to apply to festivals or use in a reel, Johnson said. (To produce her set, there was a director of photography, six camera operators and a production designer.) These aren’t iPhone videos. These are high-quality, professional clips that will make others want to hire her, too.

“That’s the tough thing in comedy. You’re either living in a multimillion dollar house, or you’re scraping by to pay rent.” Kyle Kazanjian-Amory, CEO and founder of Don't Tell Comedy

Don’t Tell wants to democratize that access. The group doesn’t care how many Instagram followers you have, Kazanjian-Amory said. They just care if you’re funny. Scrolling through the feed, you’ll see comedians of all races, genders and so on. There’s no singular type of Don’t Tell comedian. Two comedians who recently went viral following the success of their sets, Susan Rice and Andy Huggins, are both in their 70s.

“That, I think, is the special secret sauce of Don’t Tell,” Johnson said. “It’s just like, ‘Is it good? Okay.’”

Now, Don’t Tell has become the go-to place to watch stand-up comedy, said comedian Jay Jurden, especially comics outside of the big names. Unlike other outlets, like TV or streaming, one could feasibly scroll for hours on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, continuously watching more and more stand-up.

While the full 10-minute sets are posted on YouTube, Don’t Tell populates its other social media with shorter, minute-long vertical videos with giant captions, like digestible comedy nuggets, which then brings eyes back to those longer sets (like Sampson’s viral TikTok). It’s a tactic that keeps people engaged, and exposes audiences to more comedy.

When it comes to these intangibles — diversity, audience engagement, and vertical integration — Jurden said “Don’t Tell really set the bar.”

Where does comedy go from here?

By creating another pathway for comedians to get noticed both on the internet and locally, Don’t Tell has effectively paved the way for more comedians to propel their careers. Objectively, that’s a good thing — earlier this year, Vulture called the enterprise “Comedy’s Benevolent Gatekeeper.”

Yet there are limits to the format. Don’t Tell’s online audience is huge, but it doesn’t necessarily control what goes viral and what doesn’t. It might give a variety of people a platform, but just by being online, the group still operates at the whims of the algorithm.

“If you look at what else works on YouTube, or what else works on Twitter, it’s not just ‘goodness becomes successful,’” Fox said. “It is the work that gets a certain reaction out of people. And that reaction might not actually give people the right type of fans.”

The concern, Fox said, is that it might shift comedy toward comedians who are louder, noisier, or more reactionary — the things that tend to do better on social media. Or, it could create audiences that expect the entire stand-up experience to be like an Instagram reel or a TikTok video.

None of that is Don’t Tell Comedy’s fault. That’s just the internet. But if that’s the way people consume so much stand-up, rather than seeing it in-person, it could become a worry.

Still, comedians need exposure, and Don’t Tell has the ability to introduce more people to new types of comedians, at differing levels. That also means more audiences watching stand-up in person, supporting touring comedians, and just supporting stand-up comedy as an entire ecosystem.

“Don’t Tell is going to help a lot of people find some of their new favorite comedians, whose careers they will help to continue to thrive over the next few years,” Jurden said. “To me, that is ultimately very good and work that should be celebrated and commended.”

In the case of Sampson, and many other comedians like her, that work was life-changing."
entertainment,‘Beetlejuice’ star Catherine O’Hara’s most unconventional mom performances,2024-09-06,Dan Heching,"You can call her a misunderstood artiste or a “stepmonster,” but any way you put it, Catherine O’Hara’s Delia Deetz in 1988’s “Beetlejuice” is a devilishly delicious pop culture mom in a class of her own.

Through the lens 2024, the character – who returns in this week’s sequel “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” – is in many ways a hair-dye-and-formaldehyde-soaked antidote to the tradwife trend dominating social media. Married to a square and stuck in a rural house that she hates in the first movie, Delia soothes her displeasure with her commitment to art – outlandish sculpture pieces that became part of the visual signature of the Tim Burton classic – along with self medication (or, “Prince Valium”).

That is, before the undead take her on a ride that has her household terrorized by a trickster demon named Beetlejuice. Deila’s very specific verbal tics and facial expressions – not to mention an incredible lip sync performance – made her unforgettable, and, thanks to O’Hara, one of the biggest draws for this week’s new installment in the franchise.

But Delia isn’t the only out-there mom O’Hara has portrayed on the big or small screen. Here’s a look at some other titles in which the beloved Canadian actress was able to flex her madcap maternal instincts:

Kate McCallister in ‘Home Alone’

Never has a one-word movie line become so iconic as when O’Hara, as the frazzled mom of five in this classic Christmas movie, uttered “KEVIN!” after realizing she left one of her brood at home during their holiday trip to France. The movie hinges on her quest to be reunited with Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) and is ultimately quite heartwarming, but O’Hara still gets to fly a bit of her unique flag in certain moments, like when irritably pleading with the staff at the airport to move mountains to get her home (fat chance).

While she’s gone, of course, Macaulay’s Kevin has to fend for himself against bumbling burglars, and the child endangerment at the center of this tale shows that it took some guts for O’Hara to play a mom who makes a pretty serious mistake before “Bad Moms” was a celebrated cinema category.

This odd darkish comedy is made all the odder by O’Hara’s meddling and kinda homicidal mother character Beatrice, who puts her sons up to scaring (and ultimately killing) her two-timing husband. From there, she tries to convince the pair of young men to hunt down the other woman, an unassuming and adorable fast food worker played by Drew Barrymore. O’Hara’s insecure histrionics play like a slow-motion car wreck in the movie, giving it one of its brighter spots.

Moira Rose in ‘Schitt’s Creek’

O’Hara gained many new fans and admirers thanks to her performance as Moira Rose, a role that netted her an Emmy in 2020. A wayward posh actress who finds herself stuck in a rural place, Moira is at her most amusing – and cringeworthy – when trying to mother her disillusioned children Alexis (Annie Murphy) and David (Dan Levy).

Ultimately, though, her awkward and stilted efforts prove to be endearing, with the star of “The Crows Have Eyes III: The Crowening” occupying a position adjacent to Delia Deetz in the pantheon of timeless and bizarre onscreen moms.

Honorable mention: O’Hara’s hilarious role as formerly promiscuous dog mom Cookie Fleck in “Best In Show.”"
entertainment,"Atlanta rapper Rich Homie Quan, known for hit ‘Type of Way,’ dead at 33",2024-09-05,"Alli Rosenbloom, Leah Asmelash","Atlanta-based rapper Rich Homie Quan, known for his 2013 hit “Type of Way,” has died, according to a statement from the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office. He was 33.

Quan, whose full name is Dequantes Devontay Lamar, died on Thursday at Grady Memorial Hospital, according to Jimmy Sadler, the senior medical examiner investigator with the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office.

An autopsy is scheduled for Friday, Sadler said.

Details on the cause of death were not provided.

Quan was a significant part of raising Atlanta’s trap hip-hop sound to the mainstream.

Alongside rappers like Young Thug, Quan became known for his melodic approach to rap – heard in hits like 2013’s “Type of Way” and 2014’s “Lifestyle.” The latter song, which also featured Young Thug and Birdman under the group name Rich Gang, went platinum in the US and helped jumpstart both his and Young Thug’s careers.

The following year, he dropped “Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh),” another commercial success. It became one of Quan’s highest charting songs, and his dance moves from the track’s music video became so ubiquitous, particularly on now-defunct Vine, that it spurred the phrase “Hit the Quan.”

Quan was scheduled to perform at Nick Cannon’s Wild ‘N Out Live: The Final Lap tour in Atlanta later this month alongside Waka Flocka, Nardo Wick and Boosie.

“RIP Rich Homie Quan,” rapper Meek Mill, who collaborated with Quan on a “Type of Way” remix, wrote on his Instagram story on Thursday. “Prayers to his family.”

Rapper 2Chainz, who recently collaborated with Quan on a track titled “Ah’chi,” released this year, wrote on his Instagram page that they had just spoken about shooting a music video together.

“Remember me as an original. As (an) artist who did it his way,” Quan told Revolt in an interview published in July, speaking about the legacy he hoped to leave. “Remember me as a hard kid from Atlanta with a dream, who believed in himself and bettered himself — and won.”"
entertainment,Anna Sorokin sports ankle monitor as convicted con seeks to lock up win on ‘Dancing With the Stars’,2024-09-05,Lisa Respers France,"Anna “Delvey” Sorokin is not shying away from her controversial past as she readies to compete on the new season of “Dancing with the Stars.”

Sorokin was convicted in 2019 of grand larceny and other financial crimes after pretending to be a German heiress with a trust fund. She served two-years in prison and an additional 18 months detained by immigration authorities for overstaying her visa.

Sorokin has recently been living under house arrest in New York with an ankle monitoring device while she appeals her deportation order. She told People she sought and received permission from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to travel to Los Angeles where the show is produced.

Netflix dramatized her story for the popular 2022 series “Inventing Anna.”

Far from staying away from all of that, both Sorokin and ABC appear to be leaning into what made her famous in the first place.

In a press release from the network to announce the Season 33 cast, Sorokin was listed as “Notorious ankle bracelet fashionista Anna Delvey.” She will partner with professional dancer Ezra Sosa for the season.

“Some view her as a cunning scam artist, while others see her as a charismatic and ambitious entrepreneur who took advantage of New York City’s social elite in an effort to open a prestigious art studio,” her bio on the press release states. “Her case has also sparked discussions about wealth, privilege and social climbing in modern society. Her story continues to captivate the public’s imagination.”

Sorokin’s press photo for the reality dance competition shows her wearing her court-ordered ankle bracelet.

entertainment,Pat Sajak wins Emmy for final season as host of ‘Wheel of Fortune’,2024-09-08,Alli Rosenbloom,"Pat Sajak is taking home a shiny keepsake to remember his final season as the host of “Wheel of Fortune.”

Sajak, who retired as the host of the long-running ABC game show in June after over 40 years, won an Emmy for outstanding host for a game show during the Creative Arts Emmys ceremony on Saturday.

He beat out Steve Harvey for “Celebrity Feud,” Ken Jennings for “Jeopardy!”, Keke Palmer for “Password” and Jane Lynch for “Weakest Link.” Sajak was not present to accept the award.

The last time Sajak was recognized by the Television Academy for his work as the host of “Wheel” was in 1998 when he won a Daytime Emmy. He previously won Daytime Emmys in 1993 and 1997 and was honored with a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. He has earned a total of 25 nominations throughout his career.

The outstanding host for a game show category was moved from the Daytime Emmys to the Primetime Emmys in 2023. Keke Palmer won the category last year for her work as the host of “Password.

Sajak made his hosting debut on “Wheel” in 1981 and took his final spin in June. He co-hosted the show alongside Vanna White since 1982, with the pair also serving as hosts for the “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” spinoff.

White will remain on the show for two more years alongside her new co-host Ryan Seacrest, who is taking over Sajak’s hosting duties. Seacrest’s first episode as the new host of “Wheel” will air on Monday.

“It’s been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes night after night, year after year, decade after decade,” Sajak said during his final episode, which aired on June 7.

Sajak continued to say he’s “always felt that the privilege came with a responsibility to keep this daily half-hour a safe place for family, fun, no social issues, no politics, nothing embarrassing I hope, just a game.”

The long-time host announced he’d be retiring in June 2023 on X, writing that his time on the beloved game show has been “a wonderful ride.”"
entertainment,The White Stripes sue Trump campaign over use of ‘Seven Nation Army’,2024-09-09,Elizabeth Wagmeister,"The Trump campaign may be “goin’ to Wichita” before the November election, but The White Stripes would prefer former President Donald Trump stop traveling with their music as part of his playlist.

Jack and Meg White, formerly of the rock duo The White Stripes, filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York on Monday, accusing Trump and his campaign of “flagrant misappropriation” and copyright infringement of their 2003 song “Seven Nation Army.”

Their complaint, obtained by CNN, states the two musicians “vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump when he was President and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” noting that the song was used without their knowledge or consent.”

CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign and representatives for Jack White for comment. The two artists stopped performing together as The White Stripes in 2011.

Last month, Jack White said he would seek legal action after Margo Martin, a deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, shared on social media a since-deleted video of Trump boarding a plane with “Seven Nation Army” playing.

In the Whites’ lawsuit, their attorneys write that the defendants “chose to ignore and not respond to Plaintiffs’ pre-litigation efforts to resolve the matters at issue in this action, leaving Plaintiffs with no choice but to seek judicial recourse in order to hold Defendants accountable.”

Jack and Meg White are among several artists who have objected to Trump using their music for his campaign, including Celine Dion, Foo Fighters and ABBA. They are the only living artists to file a lawsuit against Trump in 2024.

The estate of soul singer Isaac Hayes also sued the Trump campaign for copyright infringement. Last week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction for the Trump campaign on further use of the song “Hold On, I’m Coming,” marking the first time a court has ordered Trump to stop using particular music, despite artists’ public objections, this election cycle."

Benj Pasek and Justin Paul’s win Sunday night at the 2024 Creative Arts Emmys gave them the “E” they needed to attain EGOT status, joining about 20 other artists who have won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards.

The pair won an Emmy for best original music and lyrics, along with Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, for their composition “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” The song was featured in the Hulu series “Only Murders in the Building.”

Pasek and Paul previously won a best original song Oscar for “City of Stars” from the film “La La Land.”

The Broadway musical “Dear Evan Hansen” won the duo both the best musical theater album Grammy and a Tony for best original score, though that wasn’t the only time they won those awards. The pair also scored a best compilation soundtrack Grammy for “The Greatest Showman” and a best musical Tony for “A Strange Loop.”

Season three of “Only Murders in the Building” was set on Broadway.

“We came up with a huge long list of possibilities of what to pull from, here’s our palette that we want to work with lyrically and then going about telling the story that we had really broken down pretty thoroughly with [showrunner] John Hoffman,” Paul told The Hollywood Reporter about working on the series. “And then it was just the fun of executing it, finding our favorite lines, how can we keep besting each other, besting that line. It was a joy and certainly something that I know we would never have come up with on our own.”

The couple soon enlist Michael Keaton’s trickster demon Beetlejuice to help scare the Deetzes away, creating all manner of otherworldly mayhem.

“I think the thing was for me I didn’t want to just tick any boxes,” Burton said. He later added, “A sequel like this, it really had to do with the time. That was my hook into it, the three generations of mother, daughter, granddaughter.”

Referring to O’Hara, Ryder and newcomer Jenna Ortega’s characters, respectively, Burton said the three generations of women would “be the nucleus” of the sequel.

entertainment,‘The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ cast react to the ‘wild’ backlash to the show’s trailer and title,2024-09-06,Lisa Respers France,"What’s to say about a show featuring Mormon mom TikTok influencers, a sex scandal and Ben Affleck’s cousin? Plenty.

Buckle in for “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,” which debuts Friday on Hulu. The series follows current and former members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) embroiled in drama over alcohol use, unwed pregnancies, male strip shows and partner-swapping.

It all starts with influencer Taylor Frankie Paul, who is credited with forming “MomTok,” by pulling together a group of fellow Mormon mothers on TikTok. Many of the members have millions of followers, sharing glimpses of their lives for lucrative sponsorships.

Paul caused a scandal in 2022, when she announced that she was getting divorced after she said she violated the terms of her open marriage. She also shared that she and her now ex-husband had participated in “soft swinging” with other couples in their Utah community, which involved trading sexual partners in their social circle.

The storyline of the show heaviy involves the fallout from Paul’s revelation, as well as her subsequent pregnancy with boyfriend Dakota Mortensen, whom she became involved with while married.

“I don’t regret where I am right now,” Paul told CNN of her relationship choices. “I am happy to be where I am. But do I wish I had went about things differenty? Absolutely.”

“I would have never opened my relationship and my marriage. I feel like that was a disaster waiting to happen,” she added. “I think announcing it to the world, I wish that hadn’t had to happen as well, but also it got us where we are today.”

The season highlights a feud between Paul and cast member Whitney Leavitt, who seems to be aiming for Paul’s MomTok throne, as the women work to repair friendships and secure their continued influencer work.

“I never really felt a competitive nature with Taylor,” Leavitt told CNN. “I think it was more so I missed getting together with all of the girls and creating content together. So I just started planning content days and then it turned into something that wasn’t what it was.”

The past and present LDS affiliation of the women has sparked both controversy and interest. While the Church has not commented on “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” directly, the organization seemed to allude to it in a message on their website the same day a trailer for the show debuted last month.

“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like other prominent global faith communities, often finds itself the focus of the attention of the entertainment industry,” the statement read. “Some portrayals are fair and accurate, but others resort to stereotypes or gross misrepresentations that are in poor taste and have real-life consequences for people of faith. While this is not new, a number of recent productions depict lifestyles and practices blatantly inconsistent with the teachings of the Church.”

Cast memberJennifer Affleck, who is a distant cousin of actor and director Ben Affleck, told CNN she’s taking online criticism to their portrayal in stride.

“It’s probably good that we’ve gotten a little bit of backlash [early] just so we can prepare us for when the real stuff comes out,” Affleck said.

“There’s eight episodes for people to give more backlash on,” her castmate Mikayla Matthews added. “I think we are going to have to go through it with each episode.”

Cast member Jessi Ngatikaura told CNN she understands the mixed reaction given come of the conservative teachings of the LDS faith, but found the uproar before the series even aired to be “wild.”

“We knew the title was going to get controversial opinions, but I really hope once people see it they can give it a second chance and realize it’s so much more than a two-minute trailer and a name,” she said. “I’m super proud of what we did…and I think once they watch it, they’re going to realize it’s a super empowering show about women and our struggles.”

The eight episodes of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” are now streaming on Hulu."

entertainment,Travis Kelce’s Hollywood aspirations: How the football star is writing a new playbook for tackling showbiz,2024-09-05,Alli Rosenbloom,"In his scripted television debut in 2020, Travis Kelce, playing a hot-headed athlete-turned-astronaut, fell into a desert sinkhole and died. His career in Hollywood, however, is alive, well and seemingly with more prospects than ever for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end who appears to be exploring the career he wants to build beyond the goalposts.

Thursday marks Kelce’s return to the field for his 12th season in the NFL as the league’s highest paid tight end. But he’s doing so with more eyes on him than ever, which is saying a lot for a three-time Super Bowl champ.

He’s entering this season having just landed roles in the Ryan Murphy-produced FX show “Grotesquerie” and Adam Sandler’s hotly-anticipated “Happy Gilmore” sequel. In October, he will debut as the host of Prime Video’s upcoming game show “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?” He also just inked a deal upwards of $100 million to bring his popular sports podcast “New Heights with Jason & Travis Kelce,” now in its third season, to Amazon’s Wondery.

“We positioned Travis to be world famous,” André Eanes, who with his brother Aaron Eanes manages Kelce, told the New York Times in an April interview. “We didn’t know how it would happen, or when it would happen, or what would help push that further along. But it’s always been the thought in the back of our minds.”

Kelce is far from the first to attempt to go from touchdowns to Tinseltown. Former NFL-ers Terry Crews and Michael Strahan and college football players Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Carl Weathers and Mark Harmon are among those who did it successfully. What he has made clear – both through the projects he chooses to pursue and his just-happy-to-be-here approach to being Taylor Swift’s boyfriend – is that Kelce is charting a path for himself in Hollywood in his own way and writing a new playbook for tackling showbiz.

Breakthing through

At the time he booked “Moonbase 8,” Kelce wasn’t a household name and had little acting experience. His only Hollywood job up until that point was starring in the 2016 E! dating reality show “Catching Kelce.” (Spoiler alert: It didn’t work out.)

John C. Reilly, who co-created the space comedy alongside Fred Armisen, Tim Heidecker and “Portlandia” executive producer Jonathan Krisel, told The Ringer in 2020 that they booked Kelce for the job after former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski passed on the role.

“When Gronkowski said no we were like, ‘We’re gonna make Gronkowski regret this! We’re gonna get the kid who’s nipping at his heels!’” Reilly joked. “And guess what, our little Travis Kelce went right ahead of Mr. Gronkowski and won the Super Bowl.”

Kelce played a satire of himself, coming off as a bossy and entitled football star who was commissioned by NASA as a PR ploy to join three aspiring astronauts (Reilly, Heidecker and Armisen) who were attempting to qualify for their first lunar mission at a moon base simulator in Winslow, Arizona. He only appeared in one episode.

“I think like anyone dipping into new territory, Travis required a bit of warming up to the whole acting thing but after a few takes he felt very natural and funny,” Heidecker told CNN via email, recalling his time on the set with Kelce. “I don’t think I was begging him to quit his day job but he was extremely dedicated, open minded and a real pleasure to work with, so it’s no surprise to me he’d find success in whatever field he’s interested in!”

Heidecker, also a musician who has a new album coming out next month, added: “It’s been cool to see him break out in such a wholesome and admirable way.”

After “Moonbase 8,” Kelce appeared to toggle between winning Super Bowl rings and making buzzy appearances on “Saturday Night Live.”

Just one month after the Chiefs won the big game in 2023, Kelce made his “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut. The next time Kelce appeared on “SNL” was in an October 2023 cameo alongside Swift and then in February 2024, he scored his third Super Bowl ring when the Chiefs beat the San Fransisco 49ers in a nail-biter rout.

Overall, the reception to his “SNL” appearances were so positive that it sparked buzz about his Hollywood pursuits, something he was asked about during a Super Bowl press conference in February.

“I’m comedy all the way… I just like to have a fun time and make people laugh,” Kelce said at the time, speaking about which genre he’s most interested in pursuing. “I’ll dabble in everything though just to see if I have fun doing it and I know there’s definitely Hollywood talks out there.”

Perhaps dabbling across all genres is a good strategy but he may also consider take cues from other athletes-turned-actors like “The Rock,” who previously spoke about one of the most important parts of his transition from college football player to professional wrestler to Hollywood star.

“I was done trying to be someone I’m not to conform to Hollywood,” Johnson wrote on his Instagram page in 2020. “Instead, I decided to be my own man and Hollywood would eventually conform to me.”

Booking gigs

In recent months, Kelce has become attached to several upcoming projects, marking what appeared to be a busy off-season.

In April, Prime Video announced that Kelce had been selected to host the streamer’s upcoming game show “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?” And then in May, Kelce landed a role on Ryan Murphy’s horror drama “Grotesquerie,” acting alongside Niecy Nash, Courtney B. Vance and Lesley Manville.

Kelce had admitted that he had some some nerves about the gig.

“I feel like an amateur right now, but it’s definitely a fun challenge, and I’m enjoying every bit of it,” he said in an interview with “Good Morning America” in June. “I’m coachable. That’s one thing I know from being in sports, I am a coachable guy.”

Kelce is also set to make a cameo in the upcoming “Happy Gilmore 2” movie, according to Adam Sandler, who is returning to star in and co-write the long-awaited sequel to the 1996 golf comedy.

During a recent episode of Kelce’s “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce” podcast, Sandler teased the scene Kelce is in, saying, “We’re gonna have fun because the scene you’re doing is with so many great golfers. It’s going to be amazing, you’re going to be funny as hell.”

The sequel will stream on Netflix.

Earlier this year, Kelce also became a first-time executive producer when he invested in the indie movie “My Dead Friend Zoe,” a dark comedy starring Sonequa Martin-Green, Natalie Morales, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman. The movie premiered at SXSW and won the SXSW Film Festival’s Audience Award.

Then there’s the podcast, the one that started as two NFL stars and brothers casually talking sports. Now, it’s a chart-topping production that has the brothers signing nine-figure deals that eclipse the ones that they signed to stay on the field.

Kelce co-hosts “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce” with his brother Jason, who retired this year from the Philadelphia Eagles after 13 years in the NFL.

If he wanted to, Kelce could arguably just keep on chatting with his brother on “New Heights” in his NFL afterlife, but history shows that Kelce isn’t one to be happy on the sidelines, particularly when the Hollywood game is calling his name.

For now, at least, Kelce maintains that he’s happiest just being the “guy on the chiefs.”

“I just love football and how it takes me away from life and gives me something I can feel genuinely happy about,” Kelce said on Tuesday during a Chiefs pre-season press conference. “I have so much excitement doing it, it’s going to be hard trying to figure out when to call it quits or not.”

But as someone once sang, Trav, who are we to fight the alchemy?"
entertainment,From ‘Mission: Impossible’ to ‘Slow Horses’: Why we love watching spies,2024-09-02,Leah Asmelash,"Is it the nonstop action, or the meshing of mystery and intrigue? Is it the Aston Martin car chases, always along some scenic route? The exotic locales? The beautiful love interests — culminating in a steamy rendezvous? Or, is it just the British accents?

Whatever it is, there’s something about spy flicks we can’t get enough of. Since the genre’s emergence, espionage has taken over both big and small screens, from long-standing franchises like James Bond, to newer efforts like the “Kingsman” series or the subversive “The 355.”

On TV, the success of shows like “Homeland,” “The Americans,” and the newer “Slow Horses” — which begins its fourth season Wednesday on Apple TV+ — highlight our collective fascination with spy narratives.

Even in a time where the genre movie has all but faded in favor of endless remakes and sequels, where television shows are often canceled shortly after they air, spy stories still grip our imaginations and studios’ pockets.

But the genre is more than just splashy gimmicks helmed by a suave protagonist. The ubiquity of these stories reveals something deeper, not just about our world, but about ourselves.

Spy stories appeal to our anxieties

As a genre, espionage was first born from literature, where spy novels and spy fiction grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, alongside increasing globalization and imperial force, said film historian Samhita Sunya. An early example is Rudyard Kipling’s 1901 novel, “Kim,” which follows an Irish boy living in India during British rule, who eventually becomes a spy.

The book is an early indication of what spy novels, and later, the spy genre as a whole, grew to be: portrayals of larger, geopolitical fears. The genre then peaked during the Cold War era, Sunya said, amidst worries of nuclear catastrophe between the US and the former USSR.

As these tensions play out on the global stage, they also play out in popular media. “Dr. No,” the first James Bond movie, released in 1962, is a prime example. The titular Dr. No, who is part of the international terrorist group SPECTRE, is a half Chinese, half German nuclear scientist, eventually defeated by Bond.

“It was almost maintaining this balance of power, and this fear of third parties also going nuclear,” Sunya said. “And that included stateless organizations, as well as anxiety about China becoming a nuclear power.”

Now, we’re experiencing another peak in the espionage genre, Sunya said. In a world of artificial intelligence and the threat of disease following the global pandemic, similar anxieties are once again arising — and making their way into spy fiction.

Last year’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” epitomize those modern fears. In both films, saving the world means defeating either a corrupt sentient AI or stopping an AI tool from being used for evil.

These movies were released during a year dominated by AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared in front of a Senate panel calling for increased governmental regulation of the controversial technology, and the Biden administration launched an executive order aiming to address the associated risks.

These confounding anxieties, in real life and in the media, feed into each other. The lines between fiction and reality can start to blur.

“You’re seeing it in art forms like films and TV, or books. That’s making people more interested in these narratives. And then they’re hearing in the media, or from government sources, that there is a real risk as well,” said Julia Tatiana Bailey, an art historian and curator at the Rudolfinum Gallery in Prague. “It just feeds into this paranoia.”

Spy stories have mass appeal

Spy fiction isn’t all just sociopolitical underpinnings. These movies have become blockbusters for a reason. They are global escapades — see Italy’s grandiose Amalfi Coast and the bustle of Mumbai, India, in Christopher Nolan’s 2020 spy thriller “Tenet.”

Or let your eyes feast on the visual buffet that is Daniel Craig stalking the streets of Mexico City during a Day of the Dead parade in 2015’s “Spectre” — a 4-minute scene that alone has gathered almost 4 million views on YouTube. In 1996’s “Mission: Impossible,” some of the film’s most dramatic moments are backdropped by the cobblestone streets of the Czech Republic’s Prague.

Of course, there are also the gadgets, the cars, the sex, even the outfits — all of which lends a certain erotic thrill that has become synonymous with the genre, and contributed to its wide appeal.

In the 1960s, for example, Eurospy films — a genre of movies that emerged in Europe mimicking the Bond movies — became hugely popular in South Asia, Sunya said. Newspapers would advertise these movies as “adults only,” because of their association with this type of erotic spectacle. Still, these movies became so popular that other countries began developing their own spy films, too.

The genre, then, became its own universe, existing outside of the geopolitical context with which it plays. We romanticize spies and the glamor around them, enough to ignore the political tensions and nervous questions some stories raise.

Ultimately, most Americans don’t know much about what spies are actually doing, Bailey said. We know covert activity happens because, occasionally, it’s publicly revealed. Last year, for example, China claimed a CIA spy was embedded in the Chinese military. This activity could be all around us, existing beneath our everyday lives. That mystery is what makes espionage so appealing in fiction.

“We’re getting an insight through fiction into a world that we know is there, but we just have no other access to it,” Bailey said.

Spy fiction teeters along that line of knowing and unknowing. On one hand, those stories are made-up figments of the author’s imagination. On the other hand, there are clandestine activities happening behind the scenes — and that secrecy plays into our anxieties, too.

“There’s a lot of interesting questions to ask about what’s reality, and what’s our sense of reality, and who’s controlling us,” Bailey said. “And all these questions come through spy stories as well.”

Spy stories are just good stories

Nowadays, the life of a spy is much less glamorous than what might be presented to us on our screens, Bailey said. Think less exciting car chases, more sitting at a desk looking up data.

But the image of spies running around chasing bad guys is a fun one. In espionage fiction, there’s a clear good guy and bad guy. The work itself is courageous and risky. Our protagonists become heroes, and we are their accomplices, trying to solve the problem of the day right alongside them.

Yet spy fiction and its ongoing popularity reveal how we use these stories to understand real-life issues, Sunya said.

“The forms and stories that that takes, even if extremely imaginative or exaggerated or spectacular, end up telling us something about how we’re trying to make sense of the real world in that moment,” she said.

Sure, there are sociopolitical reasons why certain spy movies and shows are made and popularized in specific moments. The genre can also expose our fears about our world, or our increasing distrust in governmental institutions.

Still, we’ll turn to espionage fiction and all its blockbuster charm. Who, after all, can resist a good story?"
entertainment,‘I can’t stand his voice’: A tribute to the most biting barbs made by the battling Oasis brothers,2024-08-28,Alli Rosenbloom,"There have been some pretty incendiary public family feuds through the decades, but none more infamous than that of Liam and Noel Gallagher, the brothers behind ’90s Britpop band Oasis.

After all, who else can say that they argued with their sibling for 15 minutes about who is more rock ‘n roll during a 1994 interview with NME, the audio of which went on to be released as a single called “Wibbling Rivalry”?

The pair have publicly traded barbs for decades, at least until earlier this week when they announced that “the guns have fallen silent” on their 15-year feud for a long-awaited Oasis reunion.

So while you continue to strategize about how to nab tickets to next summer’s reunion tour, or while listening to “Don’t Look Back in Anger” on repeat, here’s a look back at some of Noel and Liam’s deepest cuts at each other.

Liam to Spin Magazine in 2005: “Noel and I don’t speak to each other. That’s probably best. We see each other, but I’ve got nothing to say to him. He’s got nothing to say to me. We make music and that’s it. Or we have the odd drink together and that’s it. That’s the way I like it.”

Noel to Spin Magazine in 2005: “I’ve kind of learnt that instead of arguing stuff out with him and ending up in a fight, I work on his psychology and he’s completely freaked out by me now. He’s actually frightened to death of me… I can read him and I can f—ing play him like a slightly disused arcade game.”

Noel in 2009: Noel was quoted as saying that Liam is “the angriest man you’ll ever meet. He’s like a man with a fork in a world of soup.”

Hilariously, in 2019, Liam referenced the decade-old jab in a video of himself talking about his solo tour while eating soup with a fork. “I want to thank all my brothers and sisters for buying tickets for the tour, I really appreciate it. You’ve made a very so-called angry man very, very happy,” he said in the video posted to his X page. Great stuff. No notes.

Noel on the Oasis website in 2009: After Noel notoriously quit Oasis, he released a statement that appeared on the band’s website, which read, “It’s with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight. People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.”

Noel in 2016: In the 2016 documentary “Oasis: Supersonic,” Noel said that “Oasis’ greatest strength was the relationship between me and Liam. It’s also what drove the band into the ground in the end.”

Liam to the Guardian in 2017: “When I think about it, being in a band with him bores the death out of me.”

Liam to BBC Sounds in 2019: “I guess it’s always one bad egg in the family, you know what I mean?”

Liam on X in 2019: “Me growing my hair long is more exciting than anything noel gallghers high flying pretend spaced out pancakes will ever do.” (The quip was in reference to Noel’s post-Oasis solo band Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds)

Noel to The Guardian in 2019: “I liked (my mum) until she gave birth to Liam.”

In that same interview, Noel later said he doesn’t listen to Liam’s solo albums “because I can’t stand his voice. But I hear it on the radio… I think it’s unsophisticated music. For unsophisticated people. Made by an unsophisticated man. Who’s giving unsophisticated orders to a load of songwriters who think they’re doing the Oasis thing.”

Liam to The Guardian in 2022: “I’m sure Noel’s very happy in his world. He wrote some great songs and I sang them. It’s the voice that people want to hear. I could get someone to play Noel’s guitar parts 10 a penny. Noel can’t get anyone to sing like me.”"
entertainment,Adele says she intends to take extended ‘break’ after end of Las Vegas residency,2024-09-01,Alli Rosenbloom,"It may be a while before audiences say “hello” to Adele again.

The Grammy-winner said on Saturday during her concert in Munich that once she concludes her Las Vegas residency in November, she’s planning to take a lengthy “break,” according to video footage from the show.

“I have spent the last seven years building a new life for myself, and I want to live it,” Adele said, her voice trembling. “I want to live the new life that I have been building.”

She added that she may not take the stage again “for an incredibly long time.”

Adele has had an eventful few years personally and professionally.

In 2019, Adele and Simon Konecki – with whom she shares one child – announced their separation. She has been in a relationship with sports agent Rich Paul since 2021, the status of which the singer has been mum about amid speculation that they are engaged to be married.

Saturday’s concert in Germany marked the end of a 10-show residency.

In October, she is set to perform the remainder of her Las Vegas residency Weekends with Adele, which kicked off in January 2022 and will conclude on November 23.

In Munich, Adele went on to thank “everyone who’s come to any of my shows ever” over the past three years, during which she featured songs from her latest studio album “30.”

“It has been amazing, I just need a rest,” she said.

CNN has reached out to representatives for the singer for comment.

The singer has historically retreated from public life for extended periods of time in between the release of her studio albums.

Her most recent album was released in 2021, six years after releasing her hit 2015 album “25.” Her first and second albums came out in 2008 and 2011, respectively. She had previously stepped away from performing in 2011 to undergo throat-related surgery. She also took time off after she gave birth to her son in 2012.

Adele hinted to German broadcaster ZDF in a July interview that she would soon be stepping back from touring to “do other creative things, just for a little while.”

entertainment,Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves call each other husband and wife on their text chain,2024-09-04,Lisa Respers France,"Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are really taking that “married under the eyes of God” thing seriously.

During an episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Ryder revealed that she and her former costar still text regularly and “we always say who it is, even though it says it on the text.”

“So like on his birthday I go, ‘Happy birthday, my husband’ and then he’s like, ‘Hey, my wife, I love you KR 57,’” Ryder said. “Like on each birthday he’s like KR 57 or whatever his age is. He’s always done that.”

The pair costarred in the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola directed drama “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” in which their characters had a wedding scene.

In a 2018 interview to promote their rom-com “Destination Wedding,” Ryder said she believed she and Reeves had actually wed.

“In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest,” she explained. “We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we’re married.”

Three years later, Reeves talked about it during a video he shot for Esquire.

“We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests,” he said. “Winona says we are [married]. Coppola says we are. So I guess we’re married… under the eyes of God.”

During the recent podcast, Ryder raved about working with Reeves. However, the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” star demurred on possibly doing a “John Wick” action film because “involves a lot of stunt” and she’s “thinking of my bones.”

“I would literally do anything though with him,” she said about costarring with Reeves. “He is so special.”"

entertainment,Ian McKellen says ‘Lord of the Rings’ filmmakers ‘better be quick’ if they want him back as Gandalf,2024-09-02,Lisa Respers France,"Sir Ian McKellen is willing to reprise his role as Gandalf in the “Lord of the Rings” franchise, but it needs to happen soon.

“I’ve just been told there are going to be more films and Gandalf will be involved and they hope that I’ll be playing him,” the actor, 85, told Big Issue magazine. “When? I don’t know. What the script is? It’s not written yet. So they better be quick!”

McKellen fell in June during a performance of “Player Kings,” a new version of Shakespeare’s “Henry IV,” in London.

He told the publication he wonders if the fall happened because he is elderly.

“I’m just trying to convince myself it was an accident,” McKellen said.

“I’m left feeling weak physically, which I’m doing exercises for,” he added. “And, of course, it’s emotional. We all trip all our lives, it’s just when you get to my age you can’t always get up again.”

The legendary actor has appeared in multiple “Lord of the Rings” films and likes being busy.

“I’m usually working or preparing to work, I’ve been doing a little bit of that, wondering what might be the best plan,” he said. “I’m going to take the rest of the year off. Not because I need to, just because I want to.”"
entertainment,Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara explain why ‘Beetlejuice’ sequel took so long,2024-09-03,Elizabeth Wagmeister,"“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” finally hits theaters this weekend, but some special magic had to happen for the followup to Tim Burton’s beloved 1988 classic to take shape.

Burton brings back much of the cast for the sequel, with Michael Keaton returning as the titular demon trickster and Catherine O’Hara and Winona Ryder reprising their roles as Delia and Lydia Deetz, respectively.

But it was Jenna Ortega joining the original stars – playing Astrid, Ryder’s daughter and O’Hara’s granddaughter – who ultimately served as the lynchpin for “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”

“Jenna had to be born, become an actress and work with Tim,” O’Hara said in a recent interview with CNN, explaining why the sequel took so long to “click.”

She went on to say that Burton “thinking of this young girl’s life from her point of view, I think going deeper into that” and “seeing what an amazing actress (Ortega) is” served as the inspiration the director needed for the sequel to materialize.

The “Wednesday” star wasn’t born for nearly 15 more years after the first “Beetlejuice” came out, and she didn’t see the original film until she was about nine years old in the mid-2010’s, but Ortega was the perfect addition to long-awaited sequel.

Ortega told CNN that Burton offered her the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” role while they were working together on the second season of Netflix hit show “Wednesday,” which is based on another dark and macabre franchise – namely “The Addams Family.” (The “Beetlejuice” sequel is written by the co-creators of “Wednesday.”)

“I just was having a meeting with him about ‘Wednesday’ and he plopped the ‘Beetlejuice’ script in my lap,” Ortega recalled, going on to add that she “just never anticipated” that she was going be a part of the project.

“And then I read the script pretty much immediately, and obviously seeing Tim’s passion for it and having passion for not only the first film, but then the character Astrid herself, it just kind of felt like an almost instantaneous decision,” she said of taking on the role.

Reprising roles that helped catapult their careers back in the ’80s, Ryder and O’Hara said that returning to the world of “Beetlejuice” was fulfilling, both professionally and personally.

“There’s just nothing like it,” Ryder shared. “It’s in its own genre. That is a testament to Tim,” she added of director Burton, who she said created a “whole genre” somewhere between thriller and comedy with “a lot of different things embroidered together.”

“It was really thrilling to get to go back to that,” she added. “It’s incredible to me that he was able to create that same energy of intimacy and freedom and trying new things.”

Ortega said she learned from both Ryder and O’Hara, whom she called a “comedy legend.”

“I feel like Winona has this quality to her that – I’ve never quite seen anything like it before,” the “Scream VI” star said of her onscreen “Beetlejuice” mom. “Where someone could be so honest and vulnerable with their eyes, but still containing some sort of mysterious quality to her.”

Since the sequel took more than 30 years to come together, it might be too early to consider a third film to complete a “Beetlejuice” trilogy, but the three women said they would be open to returning, should Burton have a third film up his sleeve.

After all, the only way to conjure the ghost with the most is to say his name three times. But here’s hoping it won’t take another three and a half decades for a threequel to happen.

“Yeah, I’d like to be alive in 30 years!” O’Hara quipped."
entertainment,Angelina Jolie moved to tears during ‘Maria’ standing ovation at Venice Film Festival,2024-08-29,Alli Rosenbloom,"Angelina Jolie had a moving experience at the Venice Film Festival on Thursday.

The Oscar-winner attended the Venice Film Festival premiere of her upcoming film “Maria” and was greeted by such roaring – and reportedly lengthy – applause following the screening, that she appeared visibly emotional.

Jolie was escorted down a staircase in the theater amid the thunderous ovation and was seen wiping tears from her face, video footage shows.

The film’s director Pablo Larraín, along with “Maria” cast members Alba Rohrwacher and Pierfrancesco Favino, were also inside the theater on Thursday.

“Maria” is a biopic starring Jolie as Maria Callas, one of the world’s greatest opera singers. Taking place in 1970s Paris, the film tells the story of Callas’ tragic and tumultuous life and chronicles her final days.

The movie has already garnered Oscars buzz following its premiere in Venice.

Larraín previously directed 2016’s “Jackie” starring Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and 2021’s “Spencer” featuring Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana. Both actresses earned Academy Award nominations for their performances.

Speaking at a press conference for the new film earlier on Thursday, Jolie said that she was able to relate to Callas in surprising ways, according to People.

Among them, she said, was “the part of her that’s extremely soft and doesn’t have room in the world to be as soft as she truly was, and as emotionally open as she truly was.”

“I share her vulnerability more than anything,” Jolie said.

On Wednesday, Netflix announced that “Maria” will be shown on the streamer at a later date."
entertainment,Glen Powell responds to comparison of him to Ryan Gosling in a hilarious way,2024-08-27,Alli Rosenbloom,"Glen Powell is giving credit where credit is due.

The “Twisters” actor on Tuesday responded to a report quoting an unnamed Hollywood producer who said that Powell appeals to both male and female audiences compared Hollywood heavyweight Ryan Gosling, “whose appeal is mostly limited to female audiences.”

“Gosling is a legend,” Powell wrote on his X page in response to the article. “I’m just Glen.”

The latter part of his comment was a sly reference to Gosling’s Oscar-nominated “Barbie” role Ken, as well as the song “I’m Just Ken” from the movie, also nominated for an Academy Award last year. (“Barbie” was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)

It’s no question that Powell is one of the buzziest rising movie stars after he appeared alongside Tom Cruise in 2022’s hugely popular “Top Gun: Maverick” sequel.

Powell’s latest film “Twisters” has grossed nearly $350 million at the global box office, marking a strong followup after “Anyone But You” – the 2023 rom-com in which he starred with Sydney Sweeney – grossed $220 million worldwide.

He’s gearing up to begin production on “The Running Man” next, a remake the 1987 movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger based on the Stephen King novel about a contestant in a deadly game show.

It’s also no question that Gosling, a three-time Oscar nominee, has already cemented himself as a Hollywood leading man, so we trust that people – of all genders – already know and appreciate his bona fides.

The comparison does, however, beg the question: Can you feel the… Glenergy?"
style,New York Fashion Week: Highlights from Spring-Summer 2025 runways,2024-09-09,Jacqui Palumbo,"Over the past few days in New York City — and a little further afield, on Long Island — mainstay brands like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger looked to reinvigorate the classics, while labels including Alaïa and Off-White, who typically show in Paris, crossed the pond to define what American fashion means to them.

New York Fashion Week, which formally kicks off fashion month, has found itself at a crossroads in recent seasons as its counterparts in Milan and Paris have maintained dominance on the industry’s schedule with sought-after shows and splashy celebrity guest lists. But that doesn’t mean the city has been without its A-listers — especially since the weeklong event has coincided with the U.S. Open, bringing out plenty of stars to sit both by the court and the catwalk.

Ralph Lauren got things started with an off-schedule Hamptons fête on Thursday, recreating its iconic Polo Bar for guests including First Lady Jill Biden, singer Usher, and actors Jude Law, Tom Hiddleston and Naomi Watts. At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum the following night, Alaïa reunited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Amber Valletta and Stephanie Seymour in the audience while Kendall Jenner led the models’ procession around the art museum’s famed spiraling architecture — though Rihanna’s glittering appearance in a crystal mesh ensemble by the French luxury house was the biggest surprise of the evening.

Off-White also had no shortage of famous faces on Sunday to see creative director Ib Kamara stage the label’s first-ever New York runway, drawing singers Zayn Malik, Mary J. Blige and Camila Cabello and model Alessandra Ambrosio, to waterfront basketball courts in Brooklyn. Also in attendance was US Olympic water poloist Ashleigh Johnson — with rapper Flavor Flav, of course, who became a sponsor of her team this year — and 2024 Olympic all-around gymnastics gold medalist Sunisa Lee.

But Olympians haven’t just been on the guest list this week — they’ve made surprise runway debuts as well. Another one of the gymnastics “Golden Girls,” Jordan Chiles, traded the balance beam for the catwalk at Kim Shui, wearing a floral silk leotard-style outfit, finished with a fluttering cape, while sprinter Noah Lyles took a more leisurely pace at Willy Chavarria’s show in white athletic shorts and armbands emblazoned with “América,” the name the designer chose for a show about the immigrant perspective of the American Dream.

Chavarria’s latest collection — which featured baggy, belted khakis; crisp ties and lapels; and utility menswear skirts, followed by a separate, new sportswear line with Adidas — was set against the backdrop of the American flag and began with a performance of the classic Spanish love song “Querida.” (Guests also received small booklets from the American Civil Liberties Union printed with the full US Constitution, a reminder of the country’s founding ideals.)

It was far from the only show that expressed a sense of political urgency ahead of the 2024 election. The surrealist label Area, celebrating its 10th anniversary, partnered with Tinder to promote (and donate to) the national abortion rights campaign Bans Off Our Bodies, showing a collection of handprints and fingerprints printed, stitched and etched on the garments.

“We really think about and reflect on what is going on in the world and put that back into our clothes,” Area creative director Piotrek Panszczyk told CNN backstage.

The Nepali American designer Prabal Gurung, too, had a message, but one of hope. Galvanized by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Gurung wrote in the show notes that he wanted “create a collection that reflects “a powerful affirmation of matriarchy, femininity and the future.” Gurung’s collection of trailing neck scarves, sheer bustiers and hand-draped sari pants was full of movement on a breezy day near City Hall — and included a seemingly tongue-in-cheek reference to Harris with an embroidered coconut tree mini dress.

“I’ve always believed in power of women, of feminine-leaning ideas,” Gurung told CNN just before the show. “I’ve always believed that they saved me… and I know they can save the world.”

Another one of the gymnastics “Golden Girls,” Jordan Chiles, traded the balance beam for the catwalk at Kim Shui, wearing a floral silk leotard-style outfit, finished with a fluttering cape, while sprinter Noah Lyles took a more leisurely pace at Willy Chavarria’s show in white athletic shorts and armbands emblazoned with “América,” the name the designer chose for a show about the immigrant perspective of the American Dream.

Chavarria’s latest collection — which featured baggy, belted khakis; crisp ties and lapels; and utility menswear skirts, followed by a separate, new sportswear line with Adidas — was set against the backdrop of the American flag and began with a performance of the classic Spanish love song “Querida.” (Guests also received small booklets from the American Civil Liberties Union printed with the full US Constitution, a reminder of the country’s founding ideals.)

It was far from the only show that expressed a sense of political urgency ahead of the 2024 election. The surrealist label Area, celebrating its 10th anniversary, partnered with Tinder to promote (and donate to) the national abortion rights campaign Bans Off Our Bodies, showing a collection of handprints and fingerprints printed, stitched and etched on the garments.

“We really think about and reflect on what is going on in the world and put that back into our clothes,” Area creative director Piotrek Panszczyk told CNN backstage.

The Nepali American designer Prabal Gurung, too, had a message, but one of hope. Galvanized by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Gurung wrote in the show notes that he wanted “create a collection that reflects “a powerful affirmation of matriarchy, femininity and the future.” Gurung’s collection of trailing neck scarves, sheer bustiers and hand-draped sari pants was full of movement on a breezy day near City Hall — and included a seemingly tongue-in-cheek reference to Harris with an embroidered coconut tree mini dress.

“I’ve always believed in power of women, of feminine-leaning ideas,” Gurung told CNN just before the show. “I’ve always believed that they saved me… and I know they can save the world.”

style,Pharrell’s Joopiter puts on sale of G-Dragon’s prized possessions,2024-09-08,"Mike Valerio, Stephy Chung","Seoul, South Korea CNN —

Near Seoul’s Gyeongbokgung Palace, a hotly anticipated auction is being brought to life by two global celebrities: American singer and Louis Vuitton men’s creative director, Pharrell Williams, and South Korea’s trailblazing K-pop star, G-Dragon.

The sale features dozens of items owned by G-Dragon – an avid collector of art, design and fashion – including works he created and customized himself.

Williams’ auction house, Joopiter, is hosting the online sale and an accompanying exhibition, at the Daelim Museum.

There’s a multicolor fur coat worn by G-Dragon on tour, a pair of sneakers he had embellished with Swarovski crystals, and portraits the 36-year-old rapper painted of Frida Kahlo and Salvador Dalí.

“His fanbase, and people who love what he does — they’re able to now get access to these things that were personal,” Williams tells CNN in the South Korean capital.

“I just like the idea that this guy has opened up his trove of things that were very close to him.”

G-Dragon — whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong — rose to fame in the noughties as the leader of K-pop megagroup Big Bang. With an eclectic sense of style, he became Chanel’s first Asian male global ambassador in 2016, and started his own fashion line, Peaceminusone.

Joopiter has collaborated with a slew of celebrities since Williams founded his “digital-first” auction house in 2022. But parting with treasured possessions isn’t always easy.

“Memories hold a lot of weight and possessions hold a lot of weight, and it’s not just because you possess them — but sometimes the weight of the memory possesses you,” says Williams.

“To see people go back and forth through that tug of war is always interesting.”

Often showcasing atypical auction items – from Chinese singer Jackson Wang’s fencing helmet to Williams’ own high school varsity jacket – Joopiter hopes to broaden traditional ideas of collecting, while enticing newer, younger buyers in the process.

“The traditional and institutional auction house, consumer and spaces could’ve been perceived as a bit stuffy,” Williams says of collecting habits in the 1990s, adding that the space has transformed from being a “narrow world” to one with broader tastes.

“Now that consumer (who participates in auctions) is much more curious about culture and subcultures.”

Speaking to CNN at the exhibition, Joopiter’s head of global sales Caitlin Donovan advises budding collectors to “collect what you love.”

“So, if what you love is sneakers, start at a lower, more affordable level, and start building,” she says. “The wrong attitude is going in and trying to become a collector.”

“I think it’s about amassing memories and things that make you happy, that you want to see on your walls and on your feet. That is how you build a really beautiful, special collection.”

She pointed to Joopiter’s inaugural auction — a sale of almost 50 items from Williams’ personal stash, that raked in over $5 million.

These items were all, Donovan added, “bought because they were a moment in time and that was why they had memories, not because they were something meant to be sold one day.”

style,Could a $1.4M portrait found in a Maine attic be a long-lost Rembrandt?,2024-09-08,Oscar Holland,"During a routine house call to a private estate in Camden, Maine, auctioneer Kaja Veilleux made an unexpected discovery in the property’s attic: A 17th-century painting of a young woman wearing a cap and ruffled collar.

“On house calls, we often go in blind, not knowing what we’ll find,” said Veilleux, the founder of Thomaston Place Auction Galleries, in a press release. “The home was filled with wonderful pieces, but it was in the attic, among stacks of art, that we found this remarkable portrait.”

The artwork appeared to have been painted in the style of Dutch master Rembrandt — and a label on the frame’s reverse claimed it was by him. The paper slip, which appears to have been issued by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, also suggested the painting was loaned to the museum in 1970.

Very little is known about the portrait, however, and it is not widely recognized by scholars as part of Rembrandt’s oeuvre. While the auction house told CNN it believes the label to be genuine, the Philadelphia Museum of Art was unable to confirm whether it had ever borrowed the portrait. (A museum spokesperson added, via email, that “generally… a slip or label doesn’t necessarily verify a work of art — certainly more work would be required.”)

Thomaston Place would not disclose whether it consulted a Rembrandt expert about the attribution, but it proceeded to list the painting with an estimate of just $10,000 to $15,000. The portrait was described in sale materials as “After Rembrandt,” terminology denoting that a painting is believed to be a copy of — or was modeled on — a known artist’s style, and is not an autograph work.

But not everyone, it seems, was so sure.

After an opening offer of $32,500, more than double the high estimate, bidding at an auction last Saturday soon skyrocketed into six figures. Almost a dozen potential suitors, some of whom joined via phone from Europe, participated in the sale, according to Thomaston Place. Three telephone bidders remained until $900,000, before the last two pushed the final sale price up to $1.41 million.

The auction house believes this to be the highest sum ever paid for an artwork at a Maine auction. And the figure suggests that several collectors (including the winning bidder, identified only as a “private European collector”) believe there is enough chance that it is a genuine Rembrandt to be worth the gamble.

Lost from the records

Rembrandt scholar Gary Schwartz said a potential buyer had earlier sought his opinion on the Maine portrait. He advised the unidentified collector (who was not the winning bidder) to “go for it,” he said. The art historian told CNN he believes there is an “extremely large” chance the portrait was painted by the Dutch master.

While Schwartz stressed it is impossible to properly judge the work without seeing it in person, he pointed to a strikingly similar Rembrandt portrait, also depicting a young woman in a white cap, at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.

“The resemblance … is so strong that I am amazed that people accept one and simply dismiss the other,” he said on a video call from his home in the Netherlands, adding that he is “not surprised that somebody paid (over) a million when it came up to auction.”

Schwartz also points out that the Maine artwork featured in a catalog of Rembrandt’s work as recently as 1969. Listed under the title “Portrait of a young girl,” the painting is described as belonging to a private collector in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Although the catalog’s author notes that the attribution to Rembrandt is “doubtful,” Schwartz believes its inclusion is significant — and that the painting was simply never researched, as it was in private hands and inaccessible to scholars.

“When paintings fall out of interest, they just disappear into dark space,” said Schwartz, who published a 2022 book arguing that another downgraded painting, “Rembrandt in a Red Beret,” is in fact a genuine self-portrait.

Art historian Volker Manuth, who authored publisher Taschen’s 2019 monograph “Rembrandt: The Complete Paintings,” told CNN he was also approached by a potential buyer of the Maine portrait. He had only encountered it as a “poor black-and-white reproduction” in the aforementioned 1969 catalog, adding via email that he has “more doubts about the attribution to Rembrandt than not” (though he, too, stressed that attributions “should not be given without a thorough investigation of the original painting”).

“The price paid… might indicate that somebody has hopes that the cleaning of the rather dirty painting might turn it into a portrait with the qualities attributed to Rembrandt,” added Manuth, who is an art history professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands. “This happens more and more often. I would not be surprised to (see) the painting back on the market soon as ‘Rembrandt.’”

The portrait, which was sold in late August, was painted on a cradled oak panel and was discovered mounted in a hand-carved gold Dutch frame. Thomaston Place Auction Gallerie

A matter of opinion

There is no single authority on questions of attribution, and the influential Rembrandt Research Project ceased operations in 2014 (having not, in Schwartz’s view, ever considered the Maine portrait). Over the past century, the number of paintings broadly accepted by scholars as genuine Rembrandts has fallen dramatically, with hundreds reattributed to followers or otherwise downgraded to “after Rembrandt” status.

But inclusion in a major catalog, or the backing of a big auction house, can increase a painting’s value manyfold. Take “The Adoration of the Kings,” which was valued at just $17,000 by Christie’s in 2021 but sold for almost $13.8 million last year after new research led Sotheby’s to declare it an authentic Rembrandt, not the work of an artist associated with him.

Schwartz suggested that, should the Maine portrait receive similar endorsement, it might be revalued at up to $5 million. Speaking to the New York Times, authentication expert Mark Winter meanwhile estimated a figure “in the area of $15 million.”

In either case, the painting may, one day, be worth significantly more than the amount paid at the Thomaston Place auction. Though this may only transpire if the portrait’s new owner invites scholars to inspect it.

“The great thing, really, would be to go to Vienna with this painting, hold it up there (next to the similar portrait and) have a discussion with a few experts,” Schwartz said, adding. “It (was painted) on panel, so you can date the panel, and very often you find that the wood is from the same slabs that have been used by other paintings form the Rembrandt workshop.”

“Nobody should express a definitive opinion without studying the object,” Schwartz said."

style,How plaid became popular for school uniforms,2024-09-05,Jacqui Palumbo,"Editor’s Note: Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes is a new series investigating how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.

CNN —

As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid. The design has long been a mainstay in both classrooms and in pop culture, bringing to mind the hilarious Irish teens of “Derry Girls,” the bold ‘90s fashion of “Clueless” or the provocative outfits of the early 2000s pop duo t.A.T.u.

Plaid has become a catch-all term in the US, but includes patterns with distinct histories, including tartan, from Scotland, which is more associated with Catholic school uniforms, and madras, from India, which became a staple of American collegiate prep looks popularized by the likes of Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers in the latter half of the 20th century. It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.

But how did a cloth like tartan, once the symbol of Scottish Highlander identity and rebellion, wind up on the fictional American teen Cher Horowitz as the ultimate twist on schoolgirl fashion? The reasons for the wool textile’s success as both a national identity marker and school dress code are one and the same.

“It really communicates a sense of belonging,” said Mhairi Maxwell, co-curator of the exhibition “Tartan,” which showed at the V&A museum in Dundee, Scotland, last year. “Any club, any society, any school, can design their own tartan. You’re part of this larger club, but you’re also your own little clique within it.”

Thousands of variations have been officially added to the Scottish Register of Tartans, making it a pattern that both follows strict rules and allows for “infinite possibilities” in design, Maxwell explained. There’s the highly recognizable red, blue, green, white and yellow weaves of the Royal Stewart (or Stuart) tartan — both the official tartan of the British monarchy and one of the most popular variations adopted by the punk movement — the blues and pinks of Vivienne Westwood’s MacAndreas tartan, worn by Naomi Campbell in the 1990s; and the crimson, white and black pattern made official by the University of Alabama in 2011.

Possibly the earliest existing scrap of tartan known today is a 16th-century piece found in a bog in Glen Affric, Scotland, which the V&A Dundee studied before the exhibition. The Scottish Tartans Authority commissioned dye analysis and radiocarbon testing on the textile, which has now been dated to between 1500 and 1600. It’s known that tartan existed for centuries before, though how long is often contested.

“Tartan’s origins are so elusive — it’s really hard to pinpoint (their) origin story,” Maxwell said in a phone interview, noting that many cultures around the world have grid-patterned textiles in their histories, leading to the differing claims of where and when tartan was first woven. The pattern has specific rules, however, that distinguish it from check or gingham patterns as well as madras.

Shifting associations

Tartan’s history within Scotland has been debated as well. Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted. The popular idea that tartan designs, dyes or techniques were rigid identifiers of a particular community is dubious, she pointed out — the clans weren’t siloed off, but imported and exported their materials.

However, it was the Jacobite military leader Charles Edward Stuart — known as Bonnie Prince Charlie — who made tartan a powerful symbol, leading his tartan-clad forces during an unsuccessful uprising in 1745 to restore his family’s Catholic leadership to the British throne.

“(He) made tartan the plaid of the people, and used it to create a movement to fight for his cause,” Maxwell said. “He was already capitalizing on that idea that it was a cloth of allegiance that bound people together to fight for something they believed in.”

After Stuart’s defeat, tartan was restricted in its use for decades in Scotland through Great Britain’s Dress Act, but it had a fashionable revival in the early 19th century that received royal support, particularly from Queen Victoria. The era saw an “elite appropriation” of Highland craft and lifestyle, Maxwell explained. Previously a formidable sight to encounter on the battlefield, it now represented a different kind of pride in the form of status and wealth, making it an ideal textile to use in schools promoting prestige and heritage.

“I can’t really think of another textile which has all this baggage with it,” Maxwell said. “It’s a traditional cloth, but it’s super rebellious at the same time.” It also became a fabric with imperial implications, as it made its way around the world through the uniforms of Scottish Highland regiments at war, British colonial exports and the transatlantic slave trade.

A collective identity

In the US, tartan was first introduced when the states were still British colonies. But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014. That decade saw the textile “explode” in popularity, she explained in a phone interview, brought to market by major Catholic school uniform suppliers at the time, including Bendinger Brothers and Eisenberg and O’Hara (now Flynn O’Hara), who often had contracts with entire networks of diocesan schools.

Plaid already had ties to Catholicism, and it also visually stood out, she said. And, like across the pond, it allowed schools to brand themselves through their uniforms with a textile that allowed for a lot of variance without any external adornments.

“It creates this collective identity that’s important. It gives students this kind of embodied pride that they have regarding their school — or they can also express their rejection of that uniformity by letting their socks fall down to their ankles,” she joked.

Uniforms were only associated with parochial and private schools until the late 1980s, but public schools began piloting them as well, allowing plaid’s influence in American classrooms to spread. (President Bill Clinton was a particular proponent of them during his administration the following decade, believing they would help reduce student crime). By the 1990s, the styles were no longer just available by contracted uniform companies, either, Maxwell noted, as stores like Gap and The Children’s Place stocked up on plaid skirts and jumpers.

Globally, plaid has been revived, remixed and deconstructed any number of ways today, as designers, subcultures and television and film continue to play on the trope. For Maxwell, 1995’s “Clueless” remains a favorite interpretation. It’s also one that keeps giving, as the bright yellow plaid skirt-suit set worn by Alicia Silverstone is continually replicated, last year by Kim Kardashian for Halloween, and redesigned by Christian Siriano (and worn by Silverstone) for a Superbowl ad.

“That Valley Girl appropriation of tartan is really cool,” Maxwell said. “It’s playing off that heritage of preppy Ivy League, but flipping it on its head and making quite a feminist statement about what it is to be educated, young and aspirational.”"

CNN —

As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid. The design has long been a mainstay in both classrooms and in pop culture, bringing to mind the hilarious Irish teens of “Derry Girls,” the bold ‘90s fashion of “Clueless” or the provocative outfits of the early 2000s pop duo t.A.T.u.

Plaid has become a catch-all term in the US, but includes patterns with distinct histories, including tartan, from Scotland, which is more associated with Catholic school uniforms, and madras, from India, which became a staple of American collegiate prep looks popularized by the likes of Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers in the latter half of the 20th century. It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.

But how did a cloth like tartan, once the symbol of Scottish Highlander identity and rebellion, wind up on the fictional American teen Cher Horowitz as the ultimate twist on schoolgirl fashion? The reasons for the wool textile’s success as both a national identity marker and school dress code are one and the same.

“It really communicates a sense of belonging,” said Mhairi Maxwell, co-curator of the exhibition “Tartan,” which showed at the V&A museum in Dundee, Scotland, last year. “Any club, any society, any school, can design their own tartan. You’re part of this larger club, but you’re also your own little clique within it.”

Thousands of variations have been officially added to the Scottish Register of Tartans, making it a pattern that both follows strict rules and allows for “infinite possibilities” in design, Maxwell explained. There’s the highly recognizable red, blue, green, white and yellow weaves of the Royal Stewart (or Stuart) tartan — both the official tartan of the British monarchy and one of the most popular variations adopted by the punk movement — the blues and pinks of Vivienne Westwood’s MacAndreas tartan, worn by Naomi Campbell in the 1990s; and the crimson, white and black pattern made official by the University of Alabama in 2011.

Possibly the earliest existing scrap of tartan known today is a 16th-century piece found in a bog in Glen Affric, Scotland, which the V&A Dundee studied before the exhibition. The Scottish Tartans Authority commissioned dye analysis and radiocarbon testing on the textile, which has now been dated to between 1500 and 1600. It’s known that tartan existed for centuries before, though how long is often contested.

“Tartan’s origins are so elusive — it’s really hard to pinpoint (their) origin story,” Maxwell said in a phone interview, noting that many cultures around the world have grid-patterned textiles in their histories, leading to the differing claims of where and when tartan was first woven. The pattern has specific rules, however, that distinguish it from check or gingham patterns as well as madras.

Shifting associations

Tartan’s history within Scotland has been debated as well. Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted. The popular idea that tartan designs, dyes or techniques were rigid identifiers of a particular community is dubious, she pointed out — the clans weren’t siloed off, but imported and exported their materials.

However, it was the Jacobite military leader Charles Edward Stuart — known as Bonnie Prince Charlie — who made tartan a powerful symbol, leading his tartan-clad forces during an unsuccessful uprising in 1745 to restore his family’s Catholic leadership to the British throne.

“(He) made tartan the plaid of the people, and used it to create a movement to fight for his cause,” Maxwell said. “He was already capitalizing on that idea that it was a cloth of allegiance that bound people together to fight for something they believed in.”

After Stuart’s defeat, tartan was restricted in its use for decades in Scotland through Great Britain’s Dress Act, but it had a fashionable revival in the early 19th century that received royal support, particularly from Queen Victoria. The era saw an “elite appropriation” of Highland craft and lifestyle, Maxwell explained. Previously a formidable sight to encounter on the battlefield, it now represented a different kind of pride in the form of status and wealth, making it an ideal textile to use in schools promoting prestige and heritage.

“I can’t really think of another textile which has all this baggage with it,” Maxwell said. “It’s a traditional cloth, but it’s super rebellious at the same time.” It also became a fabric with imperial implications, as it made its way around the world through the uniforms of Scottish Highland regiments at war, British colonial exports and the transatlantic slave trade.

A collective identity

In the US, tartan was first introduced when the states were still British colonies. But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014. That decade saw the textile “explode” in popularity, she explained in a phone interview, brought to market by major Catholic school uniform suppliers at the time, including Bendinger Brothers and Eisenberg and O’Hara (now Flynn O’Hara), who often had contracts with entire networks of diocesan schools.

“It’s like virtuous consumption, where Catholics, like lots of other post-war families, had a little bit more money to spend,” she explained in a phone interview. “The companies that had exclusive contracts wanted to tap into the resources that families had and make the (uniforms) attractive.”

style,"China detains artist for scathing Mao works created more than a decade ago, family says",2024-09-03,Nectar Gan,"Hong Kong CNN —

A prominent Chinese artist known for his scathing political critiques of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution has been detained in China, according to his brother and artistic partner.

Gao Zhen, 68, was detained last week in a police raid on his art studio on the outskirts of Beijing on suspicion of slandering China’s “heroes and martyrs,” his younger brother Gao Qiang told CNN Sunday in an email from New York. The criminal offense, introduced in 2021, is punishable by up to three years in prison.

The public security bureau that Gao Qiang said had detained his brother, in Hebei province’s Sanhe city, declined to comment.

At the height of their careers, the Gao Brothers created provocative sculptures of Mao in a country notoriously sensitive about its former ruler’s legacy. But that was well over a decade ago — during a relatively liberal era for artistic expression before China took an authoritarian turn under leader Xi Jinping.

Now, some of those older works have been seized by police as evidence against Gao Zhen, his brother said.

They include “Mao’s Guilt,” a life-size bronze cast created in 2009 that depicts the former Chinese Communist Party leader kneeling, hand on heart, in repentance; “The Execution of Christ,” created that same year, which features a firing squad of life-sized Chairman Maos pointing their bayoneted rifles at Jesus; and a collection of busts named “Miss Mao,” which come in various sizes and colors, sporting a Pinocchio-like nose and large, naked breasts.

The avant-garde artists’ latest works had not been as politically sensitive or explicitly critical of Chinese leaders, their friends say. Gao Zhen had lived a quiet life in China and spent most days in his studio prior to moving to the US, Du Yinghong, a fellow artist who has known the brothers for nearly two decades, told CNN in a phone call.

Due to the “deteriorating environment” in China, Gao Zhen relocated to New York two years ago when his son, an American citizen born in the US, reached school age, Gao Qiang said.

The artist returned to China in June with his wife and son to visit family. “Before he set off, his friends and family — myself included — had all reminded him to consider whether it was safe to go,” Gao Qiang said. “He himself also thought he might encounter problems, but still, as if driven by fate, he went back.”

At first, everything seemed fine. Gao Zhen kept in touch during his trip and regularly posted on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat. In July, he organized a birthday party for his son who had turned 6 years old.

But on August 26, just over a week before the family was scheduled to fly back to the US, about 30 police raided the Gao Brothers’ studio in Yanjiao, a town on the border of Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, to “search for evidence,” Gao Qiang said.

Police demanded the artist hand over his phone. Gao Zhen refused and was forcibly handcuffed and taken away, according to his brother.

Gao Zhen’s wife received his detention notice the following day from the public security bureau in Sanhe, Gao Qiang said, adding that she had been warned by police not to speak to the media about her husband’s detention.

The police returned to the studio on August 27 to search for more evidence, according to Gao Qiang.

“A few days before his arrest, Gao Zhen told me that he was organizing his Yanjiao studio and had destroyed some unfinished sculptures in stock, including those of ‘Miss Mao,’” Gao Qiang said in an email.

“He is nearly 70 years old and naturally prone to melancholy. I am very concerned about his physical and mental health.”

‘Retroactive punishment’

Under Xi, the ruling Communist Party has vowed to eradicate “historical nihilism” — or any views that question or challenge its official version of history, including glorified images of sanctified national heroes.

China passed a law in 2018 banning any insult or slander of national “heroes and martyrs,” including military personnel. The offense was added to the country’s criminal code three years later.

Since then, the law has been used to jail a popular blogger who doubted the official death toll of Chinese soldiers in a border clash with India, and a former investigative journalist who questioned China’s role in the Korean War, as depicted in a patriotic movie.

And last year, a stand-up comedian was investigated by police for the same offense after making a joke that referenced a military slogan at a show in Beijing. It cost him his job and his employer more than $2 million in fines, though police later dropped the case and did not press charges.

Around that time, another Chinese contemporary artist, Yue Minjun, faced the wrath of online nationalists for “uglifying” and “insulting” China’s military with his iconic grinning self-portraits, but the authorities did not act on those accusations.

That makes Gao Zhen the first Chinese artist known to be detained under the law.

His brother and friends wonder why authorities appear to be targeting the Gaos’ works retroactively, as they were created many years before the law came into force.

“The artworks collected as evidence by the police were all created more than a decade ago as part of an artistic reflection on Mao’s Cultural Revolution,” Gao Qiang said. “Imposing retroactive punishment for actions taken before the new law took effect goes against the widely accepted legal principle of non-retroactivity.”

The Gaos hail from a generation of Chinese artists who pushed the boundaries of creative expression by offering an unflinching glimpse into the dark chapters of their country’s past.

The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, which roiled China in the 1960s and 1970s, inflicted indelible pain on the Gao family.

The brothers were just 6 and 12 years old when their father, a factory worker, was labeled a class enemy and thrown into detention at the height of the decade-long turmoil. Twenty-five days later, the family of six brothers was told that their father committed suicide “out of guilt for being a counter-revolutionary,” but they believed he was persecuted and killed.

“Our father’s death was a devastating disaster for our family.” Gao Zhen told the Southern People Weekly, a once-outspoken news outlet, in 2010. “We constantly worried that our mother would take her own life, but she raised us with an extraordinary resilience that few could compare to.” After the Cultural Revolution ended, Gao Zhen took the train to Beijing to petition his father’s death. The family was eventually given about 3,000 yuan (then equivalent to about $2,000) in compensation, the Gao brothers wrote in an article in 2004.

‘There’s no logic’

Friends who know the Gao Brothers say they used art to express their grief, with Mao being a recurring feature of their work in the late 1990s and 2000s.

“It was really an artistic phase; it’s not all their work. But this is why people remember them, because it was a very political, very direct critique,” said a friend who has known the brothers for over two decades.

In recent years, the brothers created works featuring world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, as well as pieces showing support for Ukraine, according to the friend, who requested anonymity over safety concerns.

“There’s no logic to arrest (Gao Zhen) now,” she said. “They were not the only ones; many Chinese artists of that generation made very critical art back then… I guess they will be afraid now.”

Even during China’s more liberal years, however, the brothers had several run-ins with authorities over their controversial artworks. Police shut down their exhibitions, confiscated their politically sensitive works, and even intimidated visitors by stationing guards outside their old studio in Beijing’s 798 art district.

“But after we promised that our studio would not be open for public display, we hadn’t run into major problems,” Gao Qiang said.

The duo went on to attract international acclaim. They held exhibitions in Paris, New York, Moscow and Berlin, with some of their works collected by prestigious museums, from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

The two brothers obtained permanent residency in the US in 2011 and traveled frequently between Beijing and New York. Gao Qiang moved to the US a few years before his brother and has not returned to China since.

Two years ago, their Beijing studio was forced to shut down, and Gao Zhen moved his studio to Yanjiao, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) away, his brother said.

Gao Zhen’s detention shows that freedom of expression in China has shrunk significantly compared to a decade ago, Gao Qiang said.

“A healthy society should move towards the broadening of thoughts and actions, instead of the other way around,” he added."

CNN —

Dubai’s super-sized skyline is already home to the world’s tallest skyscraper. Now, it is set to welcome the world’s second tallest, too.

The Burj Azizi broke ground in January this year, but its exact height was not disclosed at the time as its developer awaited approval from Dubai authorities, including the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), which is involved in planning for “supertall” buildings.

On Wednesday, however, real estate firm Azizi Developments announced that its skyscraper will tower over neighboring landmarks — all but one, that is — at a staggering 725 meters (2,379 feet) tall.

“From the outset, we had plans for two designs — one for the initially approved height of 526 meters, and the other for the taller, now-approved 725 meters,” Mirwais Azizi, the founder and chairman of Azizi Developments, told CNN in a written statement.

The developer kept its “options open for both scenarios” when it began preparatory works earlier this year. But with the green light given for the building’s more ambitious proposal, additional work to the foundations and piling is “well underway,” Azizi added.

The 131-story skyscraper will feature apartments, an all-suite “seven-star” luxury hotel and a seven-floor “vertical” shopping mall.

Located on Sheikh Zayed Road, in Dubai’s World Trade Center district, Burj Azizi will still stand almost 340 feet shorter than the 2,717-foot-tall Burj Khalifa, less than two miles away. But it will handily beat local competition for the city’s second-tallest title, exceeding the current holder, Marina 101 (1,394 feet).

Once topped out, it will also exceed the world’s current second-tallest building, Malaysia’s 2,227-foot-tall Merdeka 118.

The tower is anticipated to set several records, including the world’s highest hotel lobby (on level 11), the world’s highest nightclub (on level 126) and the world’s highest observation deck (on level 130), according to Azizi Developments. The developer also said the building will clinch the record for Dubai’s highest restaurant (meaning its 122nd-floor venue will be higher than the Burj Khalifa’s 122nd-floor restaurant, At.mosphere) and the city’s highest hotel room, on the tower’s 118th floor.

In a press release, Azizi said investment in the project has surpassed 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion).

“My vision for Burj Azizi is to create a lasting legacy, a tribute to Dubai as a destination of choice for both residents and visitors and a monumental achievement in engineering,” said Azizi in the release.

Dubai currently has more towers measuring over 300 meters (984 feet) than any other city worldwide, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

The city is no stranger to superlative structures. It boasts the world’s highest infinity pool, the world’s largest natural flower garden, and the world’s largest picture frame, to name a few.

There are many more under construction, too: The Franck Muller Aeternitas Tower hopes to claim the title of the world’s tallest residential clock tower when it opens in 2027, and Ciel Dubai Marina, scheduled for completion later this year, is expected to become the world’s tallest hotel. The Burj Binghatti Jacob & Co Residences, meanwhile, is set to become the world’s tallest residential structure (and Dubai’s third-tallest building) at 1,952 feet.

Burj Azizi is slated for completion in 2028, with apartments expected to go on sale in February 2025."

The tower is anticipated to set several records, including the world’s highest hotel lobby (on level 11), the world’s highest nightclub (on level 126) and the world’s highest observation deck (on level 130), according to Azizi Developments. The developer also said the building will clinch the record for Dubai’s highest restaurant (meaning its 122nd-floor venue will be higher than the Burj Khalifa’s 122nd-floor restaurant, At.mosphere) and the city’s highest hotel room, on the tower’s 118th floor.

In a press release, Azizi said investment in the project has surpassed 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion).

“My vision for Burj Azizi is to create a lasting legacy, a tribute to Dubai as a destination of choice for both residents and visitors and a monumental achievement in engineering,” said Azizi in the release.

Dubai currently has more towers measuring over 300 meters (984 feet) than any other city worldwide, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

The city is no stranger to superlative structures. It boasts the world’s highest infinity pool, the world’s largest natural flower garden, and the world’s largest picture frame, to name a few.

There are many more under construction, too: The Franck Muller Aeternitas Tower hopes to claim the title of the world’s tallest residential clock tower when it opens in 2027, and Ciel Dubai Marina, scheduled for completion later this year, is expected to become the world’s tallest hotel. The Burj Binghatti Jacob & Co Residences, meanwhile, is set to become the world’s tallest residential structure (and Dubai’s third-tallest building) at 1,952 feet.

Burj Azizi is slated for completion in 2028, with apartments expected to go on sale in February 2025."
style,Russian watchmaker upends race to design world’s thinnest watch,2024-09-05,Oscar Holland,"In recent years, the giants of European horology have been locked in a heated battle to design the world’s thinnest mechanical watch.

Luxury brands Bulgari, Piaget and Richard Mille have all, since 2018, held the coveted record, which was most recently broken by Bulgari’s sleek 1.7-millimeter-thick Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, in April.

But now, an independent Russian watchmaker and inventor may have trumped them all.

Moscow-based Konstantin Chaykin says his new ThinKing prototype, which he debuted at the Geneva Watch Days fair in Switzerland last week, is just 1.65 millimeters (less than one-fifteenth of an inch) thick. He also believes it to be among the world’s lightest watches, weighing just 13.3 grams (less than 0.47 ounces), without its strap.

In an email to CNN, Chaykin said he has developed various innovations to make his design thinner “without compromising its functionality,” including a winding mechanism that is integrated into the barrel of the watch. The ThinKing also features a “double balance” wheel that allowed Chaykin to reduce the number of layers in the watch movement.

Mechanisms for winding the watch and adjusting its dials are, meanwhile, found in a separate 5.4-millimeter-thick carrier case, freeing up space (though the ThinKing can also be wound with a key). Chaykin said he has filed several patent applications, though none have yet been granted.

The watch is made using stainless steel and tungsten carbide, a light but exceptionally rigid compound. Chaykin, who is the only Russian member of the prestigious Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants, said he is also considering using sapphires or diamonds in future versions of the watch, according to his brand’s website.

With the hour and minute displays separate from one another, the design resembles a face — a hallmark of the watchmaker’s signature Wristmons collection. The dials are each protected by 0.35-millimeter-thick (0.014-inch) sapphire crystals.

Thinner and thinner

Producing ultra-slim watches that are reliable, accurate and durable enough to wear has posed a major technical challenge to the world’s watchmakers. But the race to design ever-thinner watches appears to have accelerated in recent years.

Swiss brand Piaget debuted its 2-millimeter-thick Altiplano Ultimate Concept, then the world’s slimmest, in 2018, before putting it into production two years later. Luxury giant Bulgari then took the crown with the first iteration of its Octo Finissimo Ultra, which came in at just 1.8 millimeters.

Watchmaker Richard Mille soon went 0.05 millimeters thinner — a difference equivalent to a piece of printer paper — in 2022, with its RM UP-01 Ferrari. Bulgari then reclaimed the title this year with its aforementioned Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, a limited-edition model that was widely reported to cost over $500,000.

Whether Chaykin’s ThinKing can now be considered the record-holder, however, may be a matter of debate in horology circles. (Guinness World Records does not currently list an independently adjudicated record for thinnest watch.)

For one, the ThinKing is currently just a prototype — and its functionality and accuracy are yet to be independently assessed. Describing it as “more of a design and engineering study at this point,” James Stacey, lead editor of online watch magazine Hodinkee, wrote last week that he was “sure any sort of record-setting will be with (a) for-production (rather than) than non-production” timepiece.

The design is also so thin that it requires a special strap, featuring titanium supports and elastic inserts, to protect it from the shocks and stresses of everyday wear.

Chaykin nonetheless believes his prototype’s timekeeping accuracy and 32-hour power reserve qualify it as the new record-holder. He welcomed outside assessment, telling CNN that during the five-day Geneva Watch Days fair “hundreds of people” were able to inspect his creation.

“Visitors were able to hold the watch in their hands, check the time and test its functionality,” he said. “It is quite a bold step on our part to show the prototype in this way. But the watch, to our delight, works perfectly, and to the delight of the visitors, it was possible to touch the watch… However, we are prepared to carry out all the necessary independent tests.”

The watchmaker said he will present a “final” version of his design at the Watches & Wonders trade show, also in Geneva, next April. By that time, the updated design should feature improved accuracy, power reserve and “tightness,” among other things, he told CNN. He added that the watch’s price “is not yet known.”

In a separate statement, Chaykin, who founded his eponymous watchmaking brand in 2003, said he became interested in slim timepieces after encountering an ultra-thin 19th-century Bagnolet pocket watch around 20 years ago.

He was inspired to make one after being challenged by a client to design an ultra-thin watch of his own. “I initially considered many possibilities and dedicated an entire Moleskine (notebook) to finding technical solutions,” he is quoted saying.

Chaykin’s statement also compared the process of configuring the watch’s inner workings to a puzzle. “As with any good puzzle, I had to tinker, look for non-trivial solutions, choose the best options and calculate the energy flows,” he added."

style,See inside Jennifer Garner’s tranquil farmhouse-style home,2024-09-03,Jacqui Palumbo,"Since building a home for herself and her three kids over the past few years, Jennifer Garner has shown glimpses of the sunny farmhouse dwelling through her social media posts. The kitchen’s exposed wood beams and stone fireplace can be seen as she carries her fluffy cat, Moose, to places in the home he’s “never seen before” (inside the refrigerator and microwave, up high to peer at the family aquarium). She showed off her home gym and hillside pool views, too, filming herself as she trained to reprise the role of Elektra — and also, jokingly, announced that she had failed to make the Olympic Games.

But until now, Garner hasn’t given a full tour inside her Westside Los Angeles property. That’s all changed with Architectural Digest’s latest cover story, which reveals a cheerful, rustic space designed and constructed from the ground up by Steve and Brooke Giannetti — with help from designer Laura Putnam — who are well-known with design circles for building spacious and light-filled arcadian houses integrated with the natural world.

“I wanted (the home) to feel old and cool and historic, but I also wanted to make it work for a big family with a lot of things going on,” Garner told AD for the October issue. She had searched for a home with privacy, but the ones she toured all felt too “grand,” she explained. Instead, she tasked the Giannetti’s with building an entirely new space, which they based on the actor’s memories of her childhood in West Virginia, according to AD.

“I had this idea of creating something that felt like a farmhouse and a barn,” Steve said in the cover story. “We wanted natural wood, coziness—a kind of warm embrace of a house for her because she’s such a lovely person.”

The home reflects that sense of comfort, with natural materials and a neutral color scheme topped off with antique and repurposed furniture in the living room, brass chandeliers and marble countertops in kitchen, and a nickel soaking tub with views of the greenery outside.

“There’s also something a bit whimsical about her,” Brooke added. “And she likes gentle shapes, curves. This place is kind of the house version of Jen’s personality.”

There’s plenty of opportunities to connect with nature, too. The kitchen opens up to the tranquil pool and a bucolic fruit and vegetable garden, while floral and arboreal wallpaper appear in the kids’ rooms and bathrooms. It’s a house fully in use, too, rather than siloed off — a rarity for a house with multiple pre-teens and teenagers.

“I am happy that I feel like we use the space really well, and that the kids are all over the house,” Garner said. They’re as comfortable sitting in the living room as they are doing homework in the dining room. And that’s the dream, right?”

That’s the vision that Garner had, the designers explained — a thoughtful approach to how everyone might use the space once it was built. Perhaps most touching are the stained-glass windows in the study and reading room, inspired by the children’s book “All the World” by Marla Freeze — a cherished book in the family. The windows were made by the author’s son, the artist Reed Bradley, as a tribute to his mother’s work. But he incorporated Garner and her family into the symbolism of the windows, with owls representing each of the kids, as well as an appearance by their dog, Birdie."

style,I’m 36 — when do I have to give up crop tops?,2024-09-01,Jacqui Palumbo,"As a pre-teen in Y2K, the (small) shadows of crop tops loomed large. They were an inescapable fixture of red carpets and pop culture: Keira Knightley paired them with impossibly low-slung pants and Aaliyah with Tommy Hilfiger boxer-briefs, while the cast of “Buffy” battled vampires in short sweaters and tanks. In a decade when unforgiving low-rise jeans were the norm — and criticism over women’s bodies perfunctory — crop tops were not casual, easy wear; any softness of the torso was considered an aberration. I came of age on celebrity magazines and early gossip blogs that trained my eye to notice even the smallest deviations from thinness. You had to earn your stomach before showing it off.

Because of this, what should have been my halcyon midriff-baring years were not: I spent my teens and twenties both underweight and insecure, in a silent war with my midsection. It has never been firm, but curved, both from a protruding ribcage and a soft belly that may fluctuate but never flatten. By college, I was checking myself in every passing reflection, and strapped wide belts around American Apparel dresses as makeshift shapewear. I also believed that my window to wear more skin-baring styles was limited — after all, women’s desirability abruptly ends in our thirties, right? I felt as if I was quickly running out of time.

Like many women who return to old images of themselves, the body dysmorphia has cleared in hindsight. Why did I spend so much energy berating myself at my skinniest?

Now that I’m 36, crop tops have become an unlikely staple in my wardrobe, and I’m reluctant to let them go. I wear them casually for dinner dates, dress them up for nights out, and even have longer cuts with high-rise pants that I get away with at work. I find comfort and confidence in wearing something regularly that younger me would have balked at; it’s a small rebellion to reset the part of my brain that compulsively checks my stomach.

Cropped shirts began making my way into my wardrobe at 31, after several major upheavals caused me to rebuild my life in the way that I saw fit. They are emblematic of my greater sense of self-worth — a feeling I’ve noticed among my friends, too, as we emerged from our twenties with a more solid sense of ourselves.

I know now that my sense of aging even a decade ago was warped. I dreaded entering my thirties, but they’ve been by far the best years for my confidence. Even still, I occasionally wonder if there’s an expiration date to my favorite cut. Can I still wear crop tops in my forties? Beyond? I have the same questions about many things in my wardrobe that read too young or too much as I approach middle age (see: Dr. Martens clompers, over-shirt harnesses, flouncy mini-dresses, the list goes on.)

I am far from the only woman to question how to dress myself as I age, and, in fact, I have an easy blueprint to follow in my own family. I’m the same age now that my mother was when we relocated from small-town South Carolina to New York City, and — also undergoing a host of major life changes — a new world opened up to her. Though she had to keep a professional wardrobe as a real estate agent, after hours she had more fun. She happily adopted New York’s all-black uniform with leather jackets and chunky boots, and occasionally fishnets, too, as she became a backup vocalist for a downtown band called Housewives on Prozac.

At 10 years old, I was outwardly embarrassed (but inwardly, envious) of having a mother who was clearly cooler than me; I drew the line at her inheriting my electric blue platform sandals my grandfather bought for me in Chinatown after I outgrew them. Still, I also remember her own insecurities distinctly, and the body-checking habits she passed down to me that I’m sure she thought were discreet. Onstage with the band and, later, her one-woman cabarets, you would never know it. She exuded a sense of self-possession I’ve never quite mastered in any area of my life.

I know now that even though she was my mom, she certainly wasn’t old — I imagine this realization hits everyone at one point or another as they find themselves suddenly their parents’ age. Now I have a five-year-old stepdaughter (who, hopefully, is still a few years off from being embarrassed by me) and two nieces entering their pre-teen and teenage years. All of them already have very distinct senses of style, but I worry they will also grow up in a terminally online and unforgiving world that will damage their self-image. How can you grow up feeling good about yourself in a society oversaturated with digital (and real) nips and tucks?

What I can do is set an example, and try to build them up so that it doesn’t take until their mid-30s for them to be at peace with themselves. I can also keep wearing crop tops for as long as I feel like it — after all, whenever I see a woman a generation ahead of me owning her personal style and at ease with herself, it gives me something to aspire to."

style,"Boy who accidentally broke 3,500-year-old jar welcomed back to museum",2024-09-02,Associated Press,"Haifa, Israel AP —

As her 4-year-old son perused the Israeli museum’s ancient artifacts, Anna Geller looked away for just a moment. Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast.

“It was just a distraction of a second,” said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. “And the next thing I know, it’s a very big boom boom behind me.”

The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C.

What could be considered every parent’s worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators.

Alex Geller said Ariel — the youngest of his three children — is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, “please let that not be my child” was the first thought that raced through his head.

The jar, which is at least 3,500 years old, was left in pieces at the Hecht Museum last month. Hecht Museum staff

“I’m embarrassed,” said Anna Geller, who said she tried desperately to calm her son down after the vase shattered. “He told me he just wanted to see what was inside.”

The jar was one of many artifacts exhibited out in the open, part of the Hecht Museum’s vision of letting visitors explore history without glass barriers, said Inbal Rivlin, the director of the museum.

She said she wanted to use the restoration as an educational opportunity and to make sure the Gellers — who curtailed their initial museum visit soon after Ariel broke the jar last week — felt welcome to return.

Nahariya, where the family lives, is in an area just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon that has come under Hezbollah rocket fire for more than 10 months, in a conflict linked to the war in Gaza. The family has been visiting museums and taking day trips around Israel this summer to escape the tensions, Alex Geller said.

There were a lot of kids at the museum that day, and he said when he heard the crash he prayed that the damage had been caused by someone else. When he turned around and saw it was his son, he was “in complete shock.”

He went over to the security guards to let them know what had happened in hopes that it was a model and not a real artifact. The father even offered to pay for the damage.

“But they called and said it was insured and after they checked the cameras and saw it wasn’t vandalism they invited us back for a make-up visit,” Alex Geller said.

Experts were using 3D technology and high-resolution videos to restore the jar, which could be back on display as soon as next week.

“That’s what’s actually interesting for my older kids, this process of how they’re restoring it, and all the technology they’re using there,” Alex Geller said.

Roee Shafir, a restoration expert at the museum, said the repairs would be fairly simple, as the pieces were from a single, complete jar. Archaeologists often face the more daunting task of sifting through piles of shards from multiple objects and trying to piece them together.

Shafir, who was painstakingly reassembling the jar, said the artifacts should remain accessible to the public, even if accidents happen because touching an artifact can inspire a deeper interest in history and archaeology.

“I like that people touch. Don’t break, but to touch things, it’s important,” he said."

As her 4-year-old son perused the Israeli museum’s ancient artifacts, Anna Geller looked away for just a moment. Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast.

“It was just a distraction of a second,” said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. “And the next thing I know, it’s a very big boom boom behind me.”

The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C.

What could be considered every parent’s worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators.

Alex Geller said Ariel — the youngest of his three children — is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, “please let that not be my child” was the first thought that raced through his head.

The jar, which is at least 3,500 years old, was left in pieces at the Hecht Museum last month. Hecht Museum staff

style,‘K-pop idols’: Apple TV+ docuseries offers behind-the-scenes look at Korean music industry,2024-08-29,Lex Harvey,"A new docuseries gives viewers an intimate look at the lives and struggles of K-pop stars, exploring the true cost of making it in South Korea’s cut-throat music industry.

Apple TV+’s “K-Pop Idols” follows Jessi (Jessica Ho), a Korean American rapper forging a new path after leaving “Gangnam Style” artist Psy’s record label; girl group Blackswan, on the quest for global stardom but set back by interpersonal conflicts; and rookie Cravity, a nine-member boy band trying to make a name for itself after debuting during the Covid-19 pandemic.

While Jessi has been on the Korean music scene since releasing her debut single in 2005, Cravity is a splashy newcomer trying to carve out its own style and space in a crowded market. Blackswan has existed for more than a decade with different members and names, but is trying to find its way in its current iteration, which evolves as the show develops.

South Korean cultural exports have exploded over the past decade, with super-groups like BTS and Blackpink topping international music charts and K-drama series achieving mass popularity on streaming platforms.

With almost two decades of music industry experience under her belt, Jessi is the most established of the artists featured in ""K-Pop Idols."" Apple TV+

Following the performers as they embark on world tours, share emotional moments and undergo grueling hours-long training sessions, the new show offers insight into the highly competitive, multibillion dollar industry that holds its young stars to extremely high standards.

K-pop idols, many of whom begin training as young teens, are often subjected to intense pressure from their strict management, a work culture that has been linked to a mental health crisis in the industry. Several K-pop stars have taken their own lives in recent years, prompting outpourings of grief from fans.

Mental health struggles

One of the major storylines centers on the conflict between Blackswan members Leia (Larissa Ayumi Cartes Sakata) and Fatou (Fatou Samba), which begins when Leia posts on social media that she is bored during a social gathering at Fatou’s family home after the group’s first concert in Brussels.

Leia later says she found the gathering hard because she missed her own family back home in Brazil, a struggle she discusses at length throughout the series. She also addresses her depression, and the stigma that comes with speaking openly about mental health.

“I know I am sick,” the Brazilian singer said. “Here in Korea, depression is not a sickness.”

In another vulnerable moment, an emotional Jessi speaks about the sacrifices that come with the job, particularly in terms of prioritizing work over relationships.

“When I go back home (to) Korea, I go back to an empty house,” Jessi tells viewers. “It’s so lonely. I thought this was a pretty dream, but it wasn’t.”

The series also documents the K-pop industry’s recent efforts to increase the genre’s global appeal by recruiting foreign talent.

In June, South Korea’s finance ministry announced that the country would soon launch a new visa scheme, called the “K-Culture Training Visa,” for foreigners who want to train in K-pop dancing, choreography and modeling.

Having started as a Korean-only band, Blackswan’s ever-evolving lineup is today exclusively made up of overseas-born members.

Gabi and Sriya beat thousands of young women to become Blackswan “trainees,” in large part due to their nationalities according to Philip YJ Yoon, director of DR Music, the company that manages the group.

Gabi’s home country, Brazil, is one of K-pop’s biggest markets outside South Korea. And India, where Sriya is from, is the world’s most populous country — and somewhere K-pop is starting to make inroads.

The women undergo six months of backbreaking training in Korean language, rap, dance, and much else, testing not only their physical capabilities, but their mental resilience as well.

Labels also face challenges when recruiting foreign K-pop stars, according to Yoon Deung-ryeong, DR Music’s founder and CEO – one of them being the looser reins expected by band members.

“With other K-pop groups or girl groups, the company heavily controls the members. If the company says ‘don’t fight,’ they won’t fight,” he says in an early episode, referring to the conflict between Leia and Fatou.

“But, with a multinational group, everyone’s language, culture and the way they express themselves is different. So, it doesn’t make sense to try to control them the way Korean groups are controlled.”

High standards

Another topic in the show is the body image standards all K-pop idols must adhere to, and the extreme measures required to achieve it. The stars frequently speak about how little they eat and how much they train, even as their parents express concern.

Gabi and Sriya are both placed on diets when they begin training – Gabi to lose weight, Sriya to gain it.

Elsewhere, Cravity vocalist Wonjin says that when he first auditioned for his entertainment agency, Starship, he was instructed to lose weight, so he only ate one egg a day for two weeks, shedding 15 pounds.

These tougher scenes are interspersed with moments of levity: the heartwarming friendship between Gabi and Sriya, a touching embrace between Fatou and her mother, the brotherhood between the Cravity members, the excitement of fans and the artists’ high-octane performances.

Blackswan’s Fatou told CNN in an e-mail that filming the series was “freeing because we had an outlet for all of our bottled-up emotions.”

“I felt like the camera was my therapist,” added Sriya.

Blackswan’s members said they hoped the series would humanize K-pop artists in viewers’ eyes.

“We are not perfect, and we go through just as many hardships as anyone else,” said group member NVee, also by email. “But we still persevere because of our love for music.”

“K-Pop Idols” is available on Apple TV+ from August 30."
style,Signed Dalí prints ‘tucked away and forgotten’ for 50 years found in garage,2024-08-28,Lianne Kolirin,"Ten signed Salvador Dalí lithographs have been discovered in a garage in London, where they have been stashed for half a century.

The artworks, which were discovered by an auctioneer during a routine valuation, are now expected to fetch several thousand dollars at auction.

The colorful prints were uncovered when the expert was called to a property in Mayfair, central London, to give the customer an assessment of some antiques at the property.

But the visit took a turn when the pair went out to the garage of the client, who has not been identified.

The 10 colorful prints will be going up for auction next month. Hansons Auctioneers

Chris Kirkham, associate director of London’s Hansons Richmond auction house, recalled how the find emerged in an announcement on the auction house’s website.

“It was an amazing find,” he said. “I was invited to assess some antiques at a client’s home. During the visit the vendor took me to his garage and, lo and behold, out came this treasure trove of surrealist lithographs - all 15 of them.”

Together with the 10 Dalí lithographs, which are a mixture of mostly mythological and allegorical scenes, were another five by Theo Tobiasse, a French painter, engraver, illustrator and sculptor.

“They’d been tucked away and forgotten about for around 50 years. It felt quite surreal. You never know what you’re going to uncover on a routine home visit,” said Kirkham, who added that the unframed artworks were purchased from a closing down sale of a central London gallery during the 1970s.

“He purchased them with a view to framing them for his home in Berkeley Square but never got round to it,” the auctioneer said.

“So the prints ended up in his garage. They were rediscovered because the seller has been having a clear out. He’s looking to retire and move abroad, so now his lithographs will finally see the light of day at auction.”

The set of pictures are thought to have been purchased for around £500 ($660) at the time, while each Dalí print could now fetch that amount individually when the collection goes under the hammer on September 30, according to the auction house.

“Dalí and Tobiasse are highly regarded and anything connected to them is sought after,” said Kirkham. “These lithographs provide an inexpensive way to own a signed print.”

Dalí, a leading member of the Surrealist group, was born in Figueres in Catalonia in 1904 and died there in 1989. A prolific artist, he was renowned for his bizarre images which famously included melting clocks and bright red lobsters."
style,"‘Saints, Sinners, Lovers and Fools’ explores what it meant to go viral, 500 years ago.",2024-08-15,Osman Can Yerebakan,"What did it mean to go viral at the height of the Renaissance? In Northern Belgium, which underwent a meteoric socioeconomic boom between the 15th and 18th centuries, it was through art, as a budding upper middle class in search of status symbols radically shifted how paintings were commissioned, and new mass-printing technology disseminated imagery far and wide.

As the region became a hub for capitalist and colonialist prosperity — including its significant role in the Spanish and Portuguese empires’ slave trade — the cities of Antwerp, Bruges and Ghent were transformed into cosmopolitan hubs. This marked a definitive moment in art history, leading artists to gain star status and paintings to become objects of desire.

“When you have money, you want to spend it, and a great way to do so is to buy art for the walls of your new house,” said Chloé M. Pelletier, the curator of “Saints, Sinners, Lovers and Fools: Three Hundred Years of Flemish Masterworks,” an exhibition at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts running til October 20. The exhibition displays 137 artworks from this period, as well as drawings, sculptures and prints. Its title references archetypes depicted by painters Pieter Bruegel, Peter Paul Rubens and Jacob Jordaens (as well as many others), in addition to showing religious devotion, they painted everyday scenes of life — and everyday vanities.

Not unlike posting meticulously orchestrated snippets of an Amalfi vacation or a luxe wedding on Instagram today, a burgeoning collector of the era seeking public attention could show off their wealth by sitting for a portrait that radiated ostentatious triumph and prosperity. Take a mid-17th-century painting by Michaelina Wautier, for instance, which depicts a sitter in a black silk shirt posing in front of a painting he’d acquired by Rubens.

This new class of collectors ushered in the art market that we recognize today. Freed from the long-standing tradition of creating work upon requests for religious and aristocratic patrons, artists began making paintings on spec — to be promoted and sold by a then newly established profession: the art dealer.

The scenes of the era were both divine and mundane, from Hans Memling’s luminous nativity scene, circa 1480, to Bruegel’s depiction of an angry wife hauling home her intoxicated husband, circa 1620. A scene or subject’s popularity could prompt 10 or more similar versions — whether of drunk bar brawls or the baby Jesus.

As the growing new-monied class chased lighthearted illustrations of the everyday to show off wealth, the growing prominence of the printing machine boosted the circulation of these captivating paintings from collectors’ homes to those of everyday people, and even to the streets. In other words, this new method of mass dissemination made them go viral.

Stephanie Porras, art historian and author of “The First Viral Images: Maerten de Vos, Antwerp Print, and the Early Modern Globe,” told CNN in an email that the idea of virality “seems to open up (a) way of thinking about issues that art historians hadn’t traditionally considered: the ways in which the movement of images can be shaped and funneled through gate keepers and social networks.”

Art collectors at the time possessed an average of 30 paintings at home, noted Pelletier; a common party pastime during social gatherings was to guess a work’s painter, or whether the maker was the master or an apprentice.

“These were conversation pieces that you could talk in front of and laugh at,” she said. The curator considers the buzz around art stars and chroniclers of new Flemish lifestyle “an early moment of pop culture.”

Art for art’s sake

Engagement in the art world was also an early opportunity for self-branding and promotion. “Elegant Couple in an Art Cabinet,” painted around 1675 by Peeter Neeffs the Younger and Gillis van Tillborch, for example, depicts the subjects surrounded by a towering orchestration of their collection in the heart of a palatial residence — the #richkidsoftherenaissance, perhaps.

“They were interested in showing their best sides to build a self-image,” Pelletier explained of these old-school influencers. On the flip side, however, pious subjects signaled a grounding of the egos in respect for the divine, with “memento mori” details, such as a skull or a Bible quote in Latin, promoting humbleness and awareness of mortality. “They liked to demonstrate their lifestyles, but also wanted to affirm they were virtuous Christians who knew nice clothes and houses faded,” she added.

The overtness of a viral statement, similar to any trending topic or figure on social media today, faced occasional retaliation; dismay or snark from the peanut gallery was commonplace. The curator notes that reactions to a freshly unveiled painting included satirical commentary or comical illustrations circulated on pamphlet — or perhaps even an oral takedown in the town square.

“Art was the ultimate form of entertainment and social spectacle,” Pelletier said.

There was plenty of humor too, “if you were in on the joke,” she added. A circa 1530 work from Jan Massys shows two men with carefree smirks, playing with a bowl of porridge, for example. Above them are four icons: the letter D, a globe, a foot and a violin.

They mark a puzzle for the viewer to decode — when uttered out loud in Dutch, the quartet rhymes with “the world feeds many fools,” thanks to the similarity of the words for foot and feed. (The phrase is also the painting’s title.)

Playing to the gallery

But as much as staged glamour or coded banter, false information also spread into public consciousness through viral imagery. Fraudulent narratives about Indigenous people, such as that cannibalism was rife among the Caribbeans, helped to justify colonization of the new world; the exhibition includes artworks depicting this fear-mongering — including Jan van der Straet’s late-16th-century engraving of the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci encountering people roasting a human leg — and makes a potent case about the impact of a misinformed image, whether crafted with imperialist strategies then, or now through AI.

Today, we’re no stranger to how images are used to self-fashion, virtue signal and spread harmful ideas online. But it was newer territory then, as paintings provided the public a visual vocabulary to internalize a rapidly changing social landscape.

The faster spread of images prompted the abundance of knowledge — useful, misleading or silly — similar to the contemporary flux of data that ceaselessly penetrates today into our consciousness. And the art historian Porras sees a clear connection between the era’s artworks and contemporary viral images with malleable readings.

“For us, it’s clear how a viral meme or format can be re-scripted and performed so that it moves so far from its original context as to be unrecognizable,” she said. She makes her case vivid with a familiar example, as opposed to a scene of 400-year old mundane debauchery: “Think of all the riffs on the jealous girlfriend meme, which comes from a standard photo stock collection.”"

style,Banksy London Zoo mural offers clue to why wild animals have been appearing all over city,2024-08-13,Associated Press,"London AP —

Workers arriving at the London Zoo early Tuesday were surprised to discover an unexpected exhibit that suggested the animals were being set free.

A mural by elusive street artist Banksy showed a gorilla holding up the entrance gate as birds took flight and a sea lion waddled away. Three sets of eyes peered out from the darkness inside.

The painting may explain why Bansky-created creatures — from a mountain goat perched on a building buttress to piranhas circling a police guard post to a rhinoceros mounting a car — have been showing up in the most unlikely places around London for nine straight days.

Each of the works posted on Banksy’s Instagram page have included a London Zoo hashtag, said Dan Simmonds, animal operations manager at the zoo. But he didn’t imagine the artist would decorate the zoo’s own doorway.

“Part of the enigma of Banksy is obviously that everything is a surprise,” Simmonds said. “We certainly didn’t expect it was actually going to happen right here, on one of our huge admission shutters. But coming in and seeing it, kind of realized that, yeah, we’re so lucky.”

Simmonds said he discovered the mural around 6:30 a.m. when he arrived to begin feeding the hungry animals. Cyclists who circle Regent’s Park, where the zoo is located, every morning were already posing for selfies.

The roll-down shutter was closed all day to show off the work. It’s the busy season for the zoo, but the renowned street artist quickly draws his own followers and crowds show up to view it and snap photos.

Banksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world’s best-known artists.

His paintings and installations sell for millions of dollars at auction and have drawn thieves and vandals. The latest group of works is no exception and workers at the zoo shielded it later in the day with a see-through plastic covering.

The rhino that appeared Monday was tagged with graffiti. A wolf silhouette on a roof-mounted satellite dish — appearing to howl at the moon — was stolen hours after word got out about the artwork last week.

A big cat, stretching out on the back of a dilapidated billboard, was removed within hours by three men who said they had been hired to take it down for safety reasons.

The police sentry box that looked like a fish tank was removed from near the Old Bailey courthouse to the City of London corporate offices to protect it, a spokesperson said. It will eventually be placed where it can be viewed by the public.

It was not clear if the zoo mural would be the final in the series.

Simmonds said the zoo was honored Banksy had chosen it for one of his canvases. He was particularly excited to see the big ape because he had once been the gorilla keeper.

He said he’s assuming the primate in the mural is an endangered western lowland gorilla, the subspecies they have at the zoo. Simmonds identified one of the birds as possibly being a macaw and another critter as a bat.

“As for the eyes, who knows, maybe some cats peering out,” he said. “That’s the beauty of it. Literally only Banksy will know."

Designed by writer and artist Rob Liefeld in 1991, it would become the most valuable comic book cover art ever sold if it fetches its asking price, according to Heritage Auctions, which is handling the sale.

Ever since Deadpool’s first appearance, fans have embraced the mercenary supervillain turned witty and unfiltered antihero, played by Ryan Reynolds in the movie adaptations of the comic books.

“Marvel contacted me and said, this is the most fan mail we’ve had on a new character in 15 years,” Liefeld said, according to Reuters. “They were flooded with letters, fan letters, which they sent me. And the box that that mail arrived in … I thought I was getting a washer and dryer.”

When Liefeld began working on “The New Mutants” – the series in which he and scripter Fabian Nicieza introduced Deadpool – it was Marvel’s lowest selling mutant title.

But the increasing popularity of Deadpool, alongside other new characters like Cable, transformed it into a more successful series, even outselling X-Men.

And similarly, the recently released “Deadpool & Wolverine” has smashed expectations at the box office, raking in $211 million domestically on its first weekend, making it the biggest opening of 2024, the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film, and the sixth biggest opening of all-time.

With Deadpool now firmly established as a lucrative franchise in pop culture, the cover art’s owner approached Heritage Auctions saying “the time is right” to sell it, the auction house said in a statement.

The owner acquired it almost 20 years ago, after Liefed had sold it, but refused any offers to sell. In the years since then, Deadpool has migrated from the comic book to the silver screen, making his debut appearance in the 2009 movie “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” and his first lead appearance in 2016’s “Deadpool.”

If the cover art fetches $7.5 million, it will surpass the current record held by a 1938 comic that features Superman’s first appearance and sold for $6 million at an auction in April."

style,Why Ibiza is having a fashion moment once again,2024-08-09,Suyin Haynes,"There are two rather different perceptions of the Balearic island of Ibiza near mainland Spain. One is as a nightlife and party destination; home to beach clubs, world-class DJs and all-night long raves for which the island became world-renowned, particularly from the late 1980s onwards. Another provides a counterpoint to these fevered nights — a sense of tranquillity and breeziness, a yogic haven of calm and counter culture nestled in the Mediterranean sea.

That mood can be seen through the lens of Ibizan style, characterized by bohemian inspired white dresses, airy fabrics, lingerie-like garments, linens and earthy colours. This look originated in the 1960s and 1970s, explained journalist Gala Mora, when Ibiza became “the center of (Europe’s) hippy universe,” playing host to celebrities including Freddie Mercury, Grace Jones and Bob Marley.

“A mix of people from all walks of life gathered here, finding a refuge on the island and discovering a place with rich artisan traditions,” Mora, co-author of a new coffee table book “Ibiza Interiors,” told CNN in an interview. “Today, (Ibizan style) still persists and is absolutely recognizable anywhere in the world.”

Fashion brand Reformation dedicated their latest summer collection to Ibiza. Reformation

As well as on-island boutiques such as Annie’s Ibiza and Vicente Ganesha, Ibiza style is celebrated by Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson, who grew up vacationing in Ibiza, and since 2017, has spearheaded a high end collaboration between the luxury house and another legendary local institution Paula’s boutique. Together the brands produce a much-anticipated annual collection of womenswear, menswear and accessories capturing the bohemian essence of Balearic style. Summer 2024 also saw clothing brand Reformation launch an Ibiza collection, styled for going between the club and the beach (and the club on the beach).

But fashion is just one aspect of Ibiza’s growing international reputation as a creative hub once again.

Shane Fonner, senior vice president at L.E.R. public relations who represent chic agrotourism hotel Cas Gasi in the island’s center said the area is becoming increasingly popular with travellers from North America, many of whom are attracted by Ibiza’s reputation for allowing people to slow down, switch off and provide space to look inwards.

“When the pandemic happened, there was a chance to reframe what Ibiza was about: slow travel, wellness and mindfulness,” Fonner said. “The pandemic, alongside increasing geopolitical turmoil and the fast pace of (lives lived on) social media means Ibiza is (returning to) the place it was in the 1960s… In Ibiza, people are asking those questions of, ‘who are we? Who do we think we are? How do we want to live? Are there better ways to live?’ Ibiza serves as a template for this exploration, or a modern version of this exploration.”

A spate of new photobooks only endorse this view — Mora’s “Ibiza Interiors,” “Ibiza Bohemia” published by Assouline, and “Oriol Maspons Ibiza,” published by IDEA and edited by Agony + Ecstasy Gallery Ibiza, all celebrate the island’s long history as a hub for creativity, design and bohemian living.

Maspons’ book showcases the work of the acclaimed Spanish photographer who spent summers on the island from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, making hundreds of photographs showing Ibiza’s distinct aesthetic. The images capture the dichotomy of languid days spent lounging on beaches alongside riotous, glitzy club nights and evoke a sense that Ibiza was the place to be — and to be seen.

The island has a long tradition of being home to, or hosting, forward thinking creatives. The “Ibiza 59” group, so called for the year it was founded, was a collective of countercultural artists from different countries and with different styles who all coalesced on the island at the same time. This set the scene for the 1960s; the island’s first art biennal was held in 1964, and five years later, Ibiza’s Contemporary Art Museum opened in the town’s historic quarter.

The island is returning to the art scene that played such a part in it’s history, thanks in part to the Contemporary Art Now (CAN) Art Fair, bringing more than 30 national and international art galleries to the island to showcase the latest in contemporary and avant-garde art. “Ibiza reinvents itself, and I think this is a new wave in arts and culture for the island,” CAN Art Fair’s founding director Sergio Sancho told CNN in an interview.

Sancho is looking to highlight local creatives and craftsmanship as part of CAN Art Fair. An avid art collector, Sancho founded the UVNT Art Fair in Madrid in 2017, but during a visit to Ibiza during the pandemic, he found the unusually quiet atmosphere enabled him to truly see the island’s cultural offering, and the potential it had to host an international art fair.

CAN also hosts an OFF Program to accompany the main art fair which in 2024 comprised six exhibitions around the island showcasing the work of Balearic artists. “I think it’s important to give visibility to these local artists; I think this is one of the highlights of this year,” said Sancho. One such artist is Irene de Andres, who is from Ibiza and showcased a project called “Where nothing happens,” a series of video works, photographs, sculptures and models based on the memory of abandoned or temporarily disused discos and nightclubs on the island.

In some ways, “Where nothing happens,” alludes to the broader sense of change on the island and a movement away from the famed hard-partying lifestyle. Sancho attributes this shift to the pandemic: “It changed the vibe of the island, because a lot of people started moving (to Ibiza) and basing their first residence there,” he said.

While the island was once a party destination, now Ibizia is slowly rebranding as an emerging arts hub. Arxiu Fotogràfic Oriol Maspons

The vibrant atmosphere of the 1960s and 1970s also influenced Ibiza’s architecture and interior design trends said Mora, giving rise to a unique and design aesthetic known as “Ibicenco” style which continues to go find favor in fashion. The look permeates the “Ibiza Interiors” book, which showcases characteristic home designs using local stone and materials including wood, color schemes involving white and earth tones, and rattan or wicker patio furniture. Mora said that these local materials are characteristic of the island, where locals have a long history of artisanal craftsmanship and added that this style has been shaped and adapted by those arriving on the island over the decades who blended tradition with modernity.

For journalist and author Mora, that throughline between Ibiza’s past and present has always existed. “I don’t really think (Ibiza) has gained popularity in recent years; I believe it has always been popular artistically,” she said. And Mora says that while people may come to seek out a certain lifestyle, what they find may be different to what they expect. “Many artists come, settle down, and interact with each other, seeking to merge their particular style with that of the island. It is not uncommon for them to arrive with a theme or way of conceiving work, and then, over time, mold their style until they discover a new one. It’s the magic of Ibiza.”"
style,"Zanele Muholi, the ‘visual activist’ pushing for change",2024-08-08,Victoria Woodcock,"“The lack of queer visual history compelled me to produce what was missing,” says Zanele Muholi of their creative practice. For more than two decades, the 52-year-old South African photographer has turned their camera on the country’s LGBTQ community, bringing the stories of Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex lives to major art institutions around the world, raising questions about race and representation, and fostering a spirit of empowerment.

In Europe, a touring Zanele Muholi survey has been presented in museums from Paris and Berlin to Copenhagen and Reykjavik, and recently opened at London’s Tate Modern. It runs concurrently with two US shows: “Zanele Muholi: Eye Me” at The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, their first major West Coast exhibition (ends August 11), and a showcase of new work at Southern Guild gallery in Los Angeles (until August 31). Between them, the work on display ranges from Muholi’s best-known photographs to their new bronze sculptures.

Yet Muholi doesn’t refer to themself as an artist; instead they prefer the term “visual activist,” highlighting how they advocate for social change. In 2002, for instance, Muholi started work on their first photographic series, “Only Half the Picture” (2002–2006), documenting survivors of hate crimes across South Africa’s townships. At the same time they co-founded the Forum for the Empowerment of Women — South Africa’s first black lesbian rights organization. For while South Africa’s post-apartheid constitution of 1996 outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation — the first country in the world to do so — queerphobic violence remains an ever-present threat.

“A lot of experiences that people face and activities that are taking place need to be documented so that we have a proper archive, which didn’t exist before,” said Muholi during the opening of the Tate Modern show. “You have to think of the future and how the work becomes a reference point for scholars and educators. Walking around the exhibition — their largest solo show to date — “I distance myself from the work,” they explained. “I want to be in the head of the viewer, wondering what they see when they look at this work. Where do they place themselves?”

For the exhibition’s co-curator Carine Harmand, “Muholi’s work is very much for and by the black queer community.” She highlights an image in “Only Half the Picture” that shows two women laughing while trying on clothes: “It shows joy and resilience. Muholi never shows people as victims; they show them as people who live, love and care for each other.” Instead of referring to the people in their images as “subjects,” Muholi sees them as “participants.”

In “Faces and Phases,” an ongoing “living archive” of more than 600 portraits started in 2006, Muholi celebrates Black lesbians, transgender and gender non-conforming people in beautiful and bold, black and white images — 150 of which are on display at the Tate Modern. Other series include “Being” — intimate images of couples — and “Brave Beauties,” portrayals of trans women and non-binary people, often beauty pageant contestants, photographed in the style of fashion magazine covers.

“Muholi is an artist who understood early in their career the power of the photographic image to represent marginalized individuals and identities,” writes Tate Modern director Karin Hindsbo in the exhibition catalogue. “At the point of their retrospective in 2024, the proliferation of photographic images… makes the singular style and activist reach of Muholi’s body of work all the more recognizable as highly significant, and pioneering.”

Images with their own story

Perhaps most iconic is Muholi’s ongoing series of self-portraits, “Somnyama Ngonyama” — which translates as “Hail The Dark Lioness.” When Muholi’s show first opened at Tate Modern in 2020 (a run that was cut short due to the Covid lockdown), they explained: “When we document and photograph other people, we tend to forget about ourselves. I wanted to find an artistic expression to deal with the painful experiences that I was going through but drawing back to historical moments. I’m praising my ancestry.”

First started in 2012, the images often make use of imaginative props — from beaded necklaces and blankets to blown-up plastic gloves and felt-tip pens — while Muholi directly confronts the viewer with their gaze. For Harmand, the series is “an accumulation of experiences of Blackness. Each of the images has its own story — sometimes personal stories, sometimes historical events: colonial histories, apartheid, postcolonial histories of displacement, of violence, but also fetishization of the Black body.”

Muholi was born in 1972 in Umlazi, a South African township south-west of Durban. The youngest of eight children, their father died shortly after they were born. “I don’t come from a household where you’d be encouraged to become an artist,” they said. “I come from a space where you’re told that a professional is a nurse or a teacher, scientists and engineers.”

Someone who did encourage Muholi to pursue a creative path, however, was David Goldblatt, the late South African photographer best known for his portrayals of life during the time of Apartheid. In 2003, Muholi took a photography course at the Market Photo Workshop, the training institution founded by Goldblatt in Newtown, Johannesburg in 1989. “He was my mentor,” they said. “I learnt a lot from him.”

In turn, Muholi offers support to young South Africans. “Somebody rescued me and saved me, so I feel that I need to extend the love to the next generation,” they said. “It’s important.” From the sales of Muholi’s work, 30 percent is used to fund philanthropic projects. To date, this has included supporting nearly 100 people to study at both the Market Photo Workshop and Orms Cape Town School of Photography. Since 2020, the project has been defined as the Muholi Art Institute, “a mobile art institute for young and upcoming visual artists from South Africa”, offering residencies, studios and exhibition spaces.

At the opening of the Tate show, Muholi referred to their multifaceted work as “tiring”. Jet-lagged from a Los Angeles-London flight, they said: “There’s a lot of work still to be done,” while also acknowledging the role that major institutions play in this work. “Tate is big business. A lot of education is taking place here. When children have access to art from an early age, they become better artists, they become well-informed adults.”

Trevyn McGowan, co-founder of the Cape Town and LA-based Southern Guild gallery, notes: “Muholi also sees their participation in their exhibitions as vital. They show up again and again and again.”

The LA show itself combines recent additions to the “Somnyama Ngonyama” series with bronze sculptures that range from the classically figurative to a bronze cast of their clitoris, produced on a monumental scale. “It’s a new body of work which speaks on visibility,” said Muholi. “I wanted to expand the practice and also to learn from that expansion.” Their new material is laden with art-historical references that are both channeled and subverted by Muholi. “There’s something about this massive piece of work…” they said. “It’s a way in which you claim the space. People won’t easily forget it.”"

But to American photographer and journalist Nick Pachelli, a tennis court is the harmonious union of surface, sound, and spectators, complemented by the natural elements and the inherent intensity of tennis.

“Tennis is our only sport where the canvas on which we play can change so dramatically,” Pachelli, a former top junior tennis player himself, told CNN, highlighting each court’s “unique persona,” as he describes in his new photobook, The Tennis Court.

During more than 500 days of travel, Pachelli visited over a thousand courts (of the roughly 200 in the book), crisscrossing more than 250 cities and towns in his pursuit of spotlighting the world’s most aesthetic, esteemed, and even idiosyncratic tennis courts.

The result was not only an anthology of captivating, vivid visuals and evocative essays, but also, essentially, a love letter to the sport and an homage to its patrons and communities.

“The book constantly asked this question of, what do we think about when we think about tennis?” said Pachelli, “We take that question as the spectator, the newcomer to the game, the die-hard player, the professional, the groundskeeper; every single role you could think of around this sport.”

Pachelli’s inclusive approach challenges historical preconceptions of elitism and inaccessibility which have long blemished tennis. In Pachelli’s view, tennis institutions must reckon with this convoluted history in order to advance the sport and elevate its global community. Pachelli gives the example of Lawn Tennis Clube da Foz in Porto, Portugal and the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Maryland as bastions of preserving tennis’ prestige while simultaneously uplifting their local communities through initiatives such as waiving fees for low-income youths, empowering female coaches and curating programs for disabled players.

The expansiveness of Pachelli’s journey is also a reflection of tennis’ surging popularity. In 2023, the ATP (the worldwide top-tier tennis tour for men organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (the principal organizing body of women’s professional tennis) tours recorded more than 1.84 billion in combined global audiences, while the United States Tennis Association marked four consecutive years of participation growth with nearly 24 million Americans playing the sport. Pachelli partially credits local grassroot initiatives with this surge, and also notes Hollywood’s recent investment in tennis with films such as King Richard and Challengers.

“There’s so much exciting grassroots tennis happening,” said Pachelli, “There are young tennis communities emerging that are finding their own tennis sensibility.”

style,‘Sponge’ cities combat urban flooding by letting nature do the work,2024-08-13,Christy Choi,"Editor’s Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting architectural solutions for communities displaced by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.

CNN —

Most architects look to control nature; Kongjian Yu wants it to take over.

Intense storms are on the rise and cities across the world are finding it difficult to cope with deluges of floodwater. But instead of using high-tech, concrete-based engineering solutions to defend against the vagaries of the climate crisis, the Chinese landscape architect and urban planner lets nature do the work.

For over a decade, Yu and his firm Turenscape have designed nature-based “sponge cities” intended to soak up and retain stormwater before releasing it back into the environment. Varied in form and scale, the projects create new parks, restore wetlands and install rain gardens and permeable pavements, among much else.

The problem with concrete- or pipe-based solutions that funnel water away from flooded areas is that they are expensive, lack flexibility and require constant maintenance, Yu said. They may also, counterintuitively, make places more “sensitive or vulnerable” to flooding, he argued, comparing cities that rely on conventional flood mitigation to a person whose veins and arteries have hardened. Just as reduced blood flow causes heart attacks, blockages and overflows in urban drainage systems can have devastating knock-on effects.

“There’s a misconception that if we can build a flood wall higher and higher, or if we build the dams higher and stronger, (then) we can protect a city from flooding,” Yu told CNN in a video call. “(We think) we can control the water… that is a mistake.”

The Nanchang Fish Tail Park, in China's Jiangxi province, saw Turenscape transform a polluted former fish farm and coal ash dump site into a 126-acre ""floating forest."" Small islands with dawn redwoods and two types of cypress help regulate storm water and provide a habitat for wildlife. Turenscape/Courtesy The Cultural Landscape Foundation

Yu’s proposal is this: Create areas with porous earth where local plants can thrive with little or no maintenance. If it rains, the earth and plants soak up the water and prevent some (or even all) of it from flooding nearby areas. Any excess water that is not absorbed will at least be slowed by the vegetation — unlike concrete, which can instead dangerously speed up water flow, Yu said.

Turenscape has planned and designed over 10,000 of these projects in more than 250 cities across the globe, completing over 1,000 of them. Many are found in mainland China, where more than 70 cities have implemented sponge city initiatives (not all are by Turenscape, as some local governments have used other firms) since the country incorporated the idea into national urban planning policy in 2015.

Floods present a growing problem in China, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping calling the task of controlling them “increasingly arduous” in late June. According to a 2021 World Bank report, 641 of China’s 654 largest cities face regular flooding. This has partly been attributed to rapid urban development, which has created sprawl that encases floodplains in impermeable concrete.

China’s vulnerability to flooding has been thrown in stark relief this summer. In June, southern parts of the country were hit by flash floods and deadly landslides following torrential rain, with tens of thousands of people evacuated. Last month, similar devastation played out across China’s heartlands as multiple provinces declared emergency alerts and dozens of people were killed amid scenes of deadly bridge collapses, cities submerged in water and emergency responders in speedboats racing to rescue stranded residents.

But whether this latest flooding crisis demonstrates the limitations of China’s sponge cities, or supports the case to expand them, is a matter of debate.

Cities ‘not spongy enough’

Yu wants cities to move away from the grand infrastructure solutions often favored by governments and construction companies, and towards smaller-scale alternatives. They may be cheaper, too: The sponge city program in Wuhan, for example, cost more than 4 billion yuan ($550 million) less than a concrete-based approach, according to a policy brief by the UK’s University of Leeds.

A successful sponge city should be designed with location in mind, considering factors like topography, rainfall patterns and the kinds of plants that would thrive there, as well as the needs of the community. It’s a tailored and holistic approach, rather than one-size-fits-all.

In China’s tropical island province of Hainan, for instance, Turenscape transformed an old concrete sea wall, a barren fish farm and a nearby brownfield site into a “breathing sea wall” that absorbs the force of the ocean and acts as a buffer against flooding for a nearby commercial district.

The sea wall was reshaped to accommodate terraced planters, while the fish farm’s ponds and dikes were turned into a mangrove habitat. Inland, porous green space helps slow the flow of water and absorb storm surges. It has withstood several tropical storms over the past two years, according to Turenscape.

Research carried out by Yu and his firm estimates that if 20% to 30% of a city’s land is given to sponge projects, it would be virtually safe from flooding. (However, if surrounding areas also flood, it may still be difficult for the sites to absorb all the excess water.) The firm has also said that one hectare (2.47 acres) of sponge land can naturally clean 800 tons of polluted water to the point that it is safe enough to swim in.

Yet, some experts have suggested that sponge city infrastructure struggles to cope when rain exceeds 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) a day. For example, Meizhou, in Guangdong, has been designated a sponge city but experienced some of the summer’s most severe flooding after heavy rains that saw one town experience 369.3 millimeters (14.5 inches) of rain in a single day, according to the Chinese state media outlet Global Times. (Turenscape did not create any of the sponge projects in the city.)

Speaking to CNN last month, Faith Chan, professor of geographical sciences at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, said that sponge city programs in China can typically “alleviate or reduce” the impact of medium or even large amounts of rainfall, but they are “not for extreme rain.” Sponge infrastructure must be supplemented with “hard engineering,” like dams and embankments, to tackle the heaviest rains, he continued, adding: “We need both measures to improve (cities’) resilience. We can’t just rely on one.”

When asked whether recent flooding undermined his thesis, Yu acknowledged that sponge cities can still overflow if projects aren’t properly designed or built, or if rainfall is too extreme. But he argued that flooding occurs in places that “are not spongy enough,” adding: “(They) just need more sponge (projects) to make the city more resilient.”

More than flood prevention

Beyond flood mitigation, sponge cities may offer other environmental benefits. Chan said that sponge parks could help reduce urban temperatures and address water shortages, as well as providing pleasant environments for residents.

“The government wants to restore the environment and… (improve) urban ecology,” he said. “But not just that — they want to … collect rain and use it, because water is very scarce in the city.”

In Wuhan, where more than 380 sponge projects — including urban gardens, parks and green spaces — absorb and divert rain water to artificial lakes, local air quality and biodiversity were found to have improved since they were constructed. Lower temperatures were also recorded at the city’s Yangtze River Beach Park, where 45,000 trees and other vegetation sequester an estimated 724 tonnes of carbon per year.

This may be another reason Yu’s services have been sought outside China. In Bangkok, Turenscape transformed the concrete ground of a former tobacco factory into a man-made wetland with mini islands. Competed in 2022, the Benjakitti Forest Park (which was designed alongside the Thai military and local firm Arsomsilp Community and Environmental Architect) can not only soak up an estimated 23 million gallons of stormwater from the surrounding areas during the rainy season — it has also become a popular spot for tourists and locals alike.

Last year, The Cultural Landscape Foundation awarded Yu the $100,000 Oberlander Prize in recognition of his pioneering work.

“He was one of the very first people, (and Turenscape) one of the first practices, to really work with these ideas that we have to understand and harness natural processes and make landscapes that do (the) work, like cleaning water, mitigating floods, reducing urban temperature or stabilizing fragile soils,” Elizabeth Mossop, chair of the prize’s jury and dean of the University of Technology Sydney’s School of Design, Architecture and Building.

She added that Yu’s work stands apart from that of his contemporaries because of the sheer scale of his projects and the change he has been able to affect.

“The threats and the impact of climate change, and the experience of climate uncertainty is absolutely on top of us right now,” Mossop said. “We actually do know how to do a lot of these things, we do have that kind of data. We are being slowed down by political and social and cultural processes.”

Like Yu, she suggested that sponge cities’ shortcoming is that they are not, yet, far-reaching enough.

“I think the frustration is that we feel like we have the answers… If these ideas could be adopted more widely, they would go a long way to addressing many of the current threats.”"
style,‘Sponge’ cities combat urban flooding by letting nature do the work,2024-08-13,Christy Choi,"Editor’s Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting architectural solutions for communities displaced by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.

CNN —

Most architects look to control nature; Kongjian Yu wants it to take over.

Intense storms are on the rise and cities across the world are finding it difficult to cope with deluges of floodwater. But instead of using high-tech, concrete-based engineering solutions to defend against the vagaries of the climate crisis, the Chinese landscape architect and urban planner lets nature do the work.

For over a decade, Yu and his firm Turenscape have designed nature-based “sponge cities” intended to soak up and retain stormwater before releasing it back into the environment. Varied in form and scale, the projects create new parks, restore wetlands and install rain gardens and permeable pavements, among much else.

The problem with concrete- or pipe-based solutions that funnel water away from flooded areas is that they are expensive, lack flexibility and require constant maintenance, Yu said. They may also, counterintuitively, make places more “sensitive or vulnerable” to flooding, he argued, comparing cities that rely on conventional flood mitigation to a person whose veins and arteries have hardened. Just as reduced blood flow causes heart attacks, blockages and overflows in urban drainage systems can have devastating knock-on effects.

“There’s a misconception that if we can build a flood wall higher and higher, or if we build the dams higher and stronger, (then) we can protect a city from flooding,” Yu told CNN in a video call. “(We think) we can control the water… that is a mistake.”

Yu’s proposal is this: Create areas with porous earth where local plants can thrive with little or no maintenance. If it rains, the earth and plants soak up the water and prevent some (or even all) of it from flooding nearby areas. Any excess water that is not absorbed will at least be slowed by the vegetation — unlike concrete, which can instead dangerously speed up water flow, Yu said.

Turenscape has planned and designed over 10,000 of these projects in more than 250 cities across the globe, completing over 1,000 of them. Many are found in mainland China, where more than 70 cities have implemented sponge city initiatives (not all are by Turenscape, as some local governments have used other firms) since the country incorporated the idea into national urban planning policy in 2015.

Floods present a growing problem in China, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping calling the task of controlling them “increasingly arduous” in late June. According to a 2021 World Bank report, 641 of China’s 654 largest cities face regular flooding. This has partly been attributed to rapid urban development, which has created sprawl that encases floodplains in impermeable concrete.

China’s vulnerability to flooding has been thrown in stark relief this summer. In June, southern parts of the country were hit by flash floods and deadly landslides following torrential rain, with tens of thousands of people evacuated. Last month, similar devastation played out across China’s heartlands as multiple provinces declared emergency alerts and dozens of people were killed amid scenes of deadly bridge collapses, cities submerged in water and emergency responders in speedboats racing to rescue stranded residents.

But whether this latest flooding crisis demonstrates the limitations of China’s sponge cities, or supports the case to expand them, is a matter of debate.

Cities ‘not spongy enough’

Yu wants cities to move away from the grand infrastructure solutions often favored by governments and construction companies, and towards smaller-scale alternatives. They may be cheaper, too: The sponge city program in Wuhan, for example, cost more than 4 billion yuan ($550 million) less than a concrete-based approach, according to a policy brief by the UK’s University of Leeds.

A successful sponge city should be designed with location in mind, considering factors like topography, rainfall patterns and the kinds of plants that would thrive there, as well as the needs of the community. It’s a tailored and holistic approach, rather than one-size-fits-all.

style,How the super-rich are building their luxury ‘safe house’ bunkers,2024-08-07,Simon Usborne,"Few things appear to soothe the existential anxieties of the super-rich like a bunker designed to withstand anything short of total nuclear Armageddon. Yet it’s no longer enough for the security-conscious billionaire to stick an impenetrable safe room in the basement where it might sit empty forever. In today’s uber-prime properties, bunkers have gone seriously upmarket and hi-tech, in some cases growing to the extent that whole homes are becoming 21st century fortresses.

“We’ve seen a lot more of a focus on entertainment,” said Al Corbi, who has been at the forefront of secure luxury for 50 years as the president and founder of SAFE (Strategically Armored & Fortified Environments), based in Virginia, in the US. “If you’re going to be able to survive underground, we want you to be having fun.”

Corbi, who helped secure a 27-floor private home in Mumbai for the billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani (whose son Anant recently made headlines with his lavish wedding celebrations), is currently working on a sprawling house on a 200-acre wooded plot, at an undisclosed location in the US (he is understandably tight-lipped about many aspects of his work).

The house itself, Corbi said in an interview via Zoom, is ultra-secure with the blast-proof doors, unbreakable windows and biometric door-entry systems. Then there’s the 30-foot-deep moat with a swing bridge, the water canons capable of taking out helicopters, drones or skydivers, and the film of flammable liquid that can be automatically deployed across the surface of the artificial lake and ignited to create a defensive ring of fire.

“Look at medieval times, a moat is one of the greatest deterrents,” said Corbi. “But they didn’t have jet skis back then.” Corbi’s client, a business mogul and avid watersports fan, saw a dual use for his moat and plans to use it as a race track for his alpha pals, too.

The very wealthy have always been targets, whether from intruders, kidnappers, or assassins. Now fears have grown to include “eat the rich” anti-capitalist activists, extreme weather caused by climate change, terrorists, unforeseen apocalyptic events — and a perennial pandemic threat that was made all too real in 2020.

‘Like the Ritz-Carlton, underground’

Corbi, who has also built underground escape tunnels that double as go-kart tracks, said there is no appetite among his clients for utilitarian design in safe spaces. Even 50 years ago, he says traditional bunkers looked like high-end hotels — “kind of like the Ritz Carlton, underground”. But now his richest clients would scoff at such modesty.

A spirit of one upmanship may partly be driving demand. Several specialists have reported a bump in inquiries since reports surfaced last year of a huge compound that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is building in Hawaii, which, public planning documents revealed, includes a 5,000 sq ft underground shelter with living space, a plant and mechanical room to keep the bunker operational, and an escape hatch. Bill Gates reportedly has bunkers under all of his many homes.

Graham Harris, a founding partner at SHH Architecture and Interior Design in London, one of the world’s leading high net worth design studios, said he, too, is responding to shifting demands. Not long ago, clients tended to build the bathrooms of their primary suites to withstand attacks. Interior walls would be made of concrete, and secure doors were designed to blend with the home’s decor. Better to be able to pop next door at night than try to race down to a far-off basement.

“Now they’ve really grown in size and stature,” said Harris, who often now secures the whole suite rather than just the bathroom, allowing clients to cocoon themselves with the flick of a bedside switch. “We also did a house in Highgate (an upmarket area of north London) where the cinema was actually the safe room with its own separate filtered air supply, secure doors, a kitchenette and a fully stocked area that could sustain a family for over a week.”

Another client turned his 3,000 sq ft art gallery into a safe room, which also had a separate power supply. To help keep such spaces comfortable, smart “skylights” can be installed in the ceiling to mimic the time and outside weather, bathing subterranean interiors in constantly changing “natural” light.

Shark tanks, shooting ranges and simulators

Secret doors and passageways have become as much a desirable novelty to show off to guests after dinner as a vital safety feature. Creative Home Engineering in Arizona — a company who specialize in creating and installing them for clients around the globe — recently built a giant working rotating fireplace that swivels to reveal the underground entrance to a shooting range. In another house, an old British phone booth has been engineered so that when the right code is entered on the keypad, the glass windows turn opaque, and the back wall opens to reveal a slide leading to a secure basement complex that includes a flight simulator and a shark tank.

Increasingly, the ultra wealthy are interested in features such as escape tunnels and medical rooms as seen on these renderings. SAFE say they have created some facilities to rival operating theatres at the best hospitals, with decontamination chambers and fully stocked pharmacies. Courtesy SAFE

Corbi said billionaires have always been wise to danger, but he has now noticed far more inquiries from millionaires who might traditionally have been content with standard security measures. For this market, existing rooms can be secured for a few thousand dollars. For hundreds of thousands, prefabricated modular steel bunkers can be dropped into the ground under a new-build house.

For all but the most secure systems, Corbi explained his clients are simply buying time: “If someone breaks in at night, they’re still going to get in, but they’re not going to be able to get into the bedroom, where the family is safe plenty long enough for the police to finish their coffee and donuts.”

At the richer end of the spectrum, billionaires are increasingly paranoid about threats to their health, whether from bioterror attacks, viral pandemics or old-fashioned heart failures and accidents. Covid gave a big boost to this part of SAFE’s business, which Corbi’s wife Naomi, a registered nurse, now heads up.

Some of the rooms she has overseen the creation of are as well-equipped as operating theatres at the best hospitals, with decontamination chambers, wardrobes of personal protective equipment and pharmacies stocked with emergency medicines as well as vitamin compounds tailored to residents to help them withstand long periods in isolation.

“Forget nuclear bombs, the thing we should be prepping for is real life,” Corbi said. “If I had a dollar to spend on a bunker or on medical preparedness, I know what I’d do. The days when you can throw a first aid kit in a prefab bunker and say you’re safe are long gone.”"

“I think I always see potential in things,” she told Architectural Digest for the magazine’s September cover story. “I just saw that there were some easy tweaks that could make it better, and I felt at home.”

The earthy, picturesque home, painted in hues of moss green, off-white and blush by Farrow & Ball, may offer a retreat from Jame’s home base in Brooklyn — when she has time. James is a visible figure in the fashion world. In addition to growing her line, worn by Beyoncé, Ayo Edebiri and Rosario Dawson, she’s also dedicated herself to holding the industry accountable through her nonprofit, the Fifteen Percent Pledge. The organization, which she founded in 2020, asks retailers and other companies to stock 15% of goods from Black-owned brands (Nordstrom, Sephora and Rent the Runway are among the companies listed on the organization’s site who have made the pledge).

James is socially and politically active in other significant ways, too, from teaming up with Michelle Obama’s nonprofit When We All Vote to produce “vote” crew socks in 2020, to dressing US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the much-talked-about “Tax the Rich” gown at the 2021 Met Gala.

Working on her three-bedroom home over the past four years has been an opportunity to exercise her personal creativity — especially since her self-described “catnip” is “being on the internet at 11 p.m., searching for a weird light,” she told AD.

In a 2022 interview with The Cut, James categorized her 60- to 80-hour work weeks as a “mad dash” but lately, striving for balance seems to be more her style. James recently replaced her home pilates and fitness studio with a serene sanctuary for sprawling out, with hanging lanterns by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and a float couch by Sarah Ellison (whose design studio also produced James’ sphere-legged bed and coffee table).

“It has been really nice to have a period of time where I could just make something that was, for sure, my own,” she told AD. “These days more than ever, I think creating a house with the intention of satisfying your own emotional, mental, physical well-being is really important.”

Other moments of zen include her greenery-framed stone and terracotta outdoor kitchen with a wood-burning oven, and a primary bathroom that features a blue welded conservatory-like shower. Less zen: the process of getting a 1,000-pound stone sink into her indoor kitchen.

But the overall effect is a home with ample visual interest, from her art collection featuring important contemporary Black artists like Tyler Mitchell, Mickalene Thomas and Tschabalala Self, to the unexpected details that enliven the space, like the wood and chartreuse stairs that lead to the second floor.

“I don’t think that houses are ever done,” she said. “That’s part of the reason why it took me four years to do this, because I kept waiting for it to be ‘done.’”

She calls her home a “snapshot” of her life now – but it’s not necessarily set in stone. “Sometimes you have to just do what’s right for you right now. It doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to stay that way forever.”"

In addition to growing her line, worn by Beyoncé, Ayo Edebiri and Rosario Dawson, she’s also dedicated herself to holding the industry accountable through her nonprofit, the Fifteen Percent Pledge. The organization, which she founded in 2020, asks retailers and other companies to stock 15% of goods from Black-owned brands (Nordstrom, Sephora and Rent the Runway are among the companies listed on the organization’s site who have made the pledge).

James is socially and politically active in other significant ways, too, from teaming up with Michelle Obama’s nonprofit When We All Vote to produce “vote” crew socks in 2020, to dressing US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the much-talked-about “Tax the Rich” gown at the 2021 Met Gala.

Working on her three-bedroom home over the past four years has been an opportunity to exercise her personal creativity — especially since her self-described “catnip” is “being on the internet at 11 p.m., searching for a weird light,” she told AD.

In a 2022 interview with The Cut, James categorized her 60- to 80-hour work weeks as a “mad dash” but lately, striving for balance seems to be more her style. James recently replaced her home pilates and fitness studio with a serene sanctuary for sprawling out, with hanging lanterns by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and a float couch by Sarah Ellison (whose design studio also produced James’ sphere-legged bed and coffee table).

“It has been really nice to have a period of time where I could just make something that was, for sure, my own,” she told AD. “These days more than ever, I think creating a house with the intention of satisfying your own emotional, mental, physical well-being is really important.”

Other moments of zen include her greenery-framed stone and terracotta outdoor kitchen with a wood-burning oven, and a primary bathroom that features a blue welded conservatory-like shower. Less zen: the process of getting a 1,000-pound stone sink into her indoor kitchen.

But the overall effect is a home with ample visual interest, from her art collection featuring important contemporary Black artists like Tyler Mitchell, Mickalene Thomas and Tschabalala Self, to the unexpected details that enliven the space, like the wood and chartreuse stairs that lead to the second floor.

“I don’t think that houses are ever done,” she said. “That’s part of the reason why it took me four years to do this, because I kept waiting for it to be ‘done.’”

She calls her home a “snapshot” of her life now – but it’s not necessarily set in stone. “Sometimes you have to just do what’s right for you right now. It doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to stay that way forever.”"
style,Venice Film Festival red carpet showcases old Hollywood glamour,2024-08-30,Leah Dolan,"What year is it again? Some of the looks on the red carpet at the 81st Venice Film Festival could suggest the year was 1924, rather than 2024. Since the 11 day event began on August 28, attendees have given elegant nods to old Hollywood glamour: from time-honored dress silhouettes to vintage-inspired accessories.

Yesterday, Tilda Swinton was seen stepping out of a Venetian water taxi in a custom navy Delpozo silk set — complete with a pair of capris that would make Audrey Hepburn envious. While last week at the premiere for Pablo Larrian’s “Maria” — a biopic following the tumultuous life of 20th century soprano Maria Callas — leading lady Angelina Jolie seemed to channel her on-screen counterpart. Dressed in a nude-toned custom Tamara Ralph gown, Jolie finished off her look with a 1930s-style faux fur shrug, a golden rose-shaped brooch and a deep red lipstick. While Jolie’s piece is a dead ringer for the shrugs worn by the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo, Tamara Ralph’s faux reimagining brings the antiquated accessory into the modern day.

But Jolie wasn’t the only guest at the “Maria” screening taking cues from the starlets of yore. Taylor Russell floated across the carpet in a pale yellow silk crepon dress with a matching scarf attached to the train. The look, a custom creation from Loewe, had a distinct 1930’s feel thanks to the artfully draped evening scarf and conjured Marilyn Monroe in the 1953 film “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” — where Monroe wears a fiery bejeweled gown elevated by an orange chiffon scarf. Coco Chanel, too, in her Spring-Summer 1930 collection topped silk crepe dresses with an extra yard of fabric styled gracefully around the neck.

Isabelle Huppert, the festival’s jury president, fast-forwarded a couple of decades for her “Beetlejuice” premiere look. According to British Vogue, the “pope red” opera coat was inspired by 1950s theater goers. Lifted from Balenciaga’s 50th couture collection designed in 2021, Huppert paired the evening gown with white elbow gloves and a stack of Cartier bracelets on each wrist.

Chilean actor Mariana di Girolamo similarly resurrected a vintage silhouette for her Venice Film Festival appearance. Her black embellished Chanel cape dress, worn to the screening of “El Jockey” was a masterclass in harnessing fashion history — since the house has been designing dramatic evening capes for almost a century. Di Girolamo’s version was glamorous yet understated, with an outline of sparkle made from embroidered beads and sequins.

style,Joe Ando: Meet the TikToker behind Ella Emhoff’s internet-breaking DNC dress,2024-08-29,Leah Dolan,"“It was cool,” says the 28-year-old viral TikToker and Fashion Institute of Technology graduate Joe Ando, on seeing his creation live on TV at the Democratic National Convention last week. “I wish I had a better word to describe it than cool.”

It was the dress of the night — a pale blue silk off-the-shoulder bodice and a hand-ruched tulle midi skirt. Its wearer, of course, was Ella Emhoff, Vice President Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter and potential next first daughter of the US. “My brain is always under the assumption it’s not that big of a deal,” Ando told CNN via Zoom from his home in Brooklyn, New York. “She needs a dress and she wears it, and people will watch this event but it won’t really be about what she’s wearing. But this was so public.”

The dress was deemed “White House-worthy” by streetwear and fashion blog Highsnobiety, while Vogue mused whether it solidified Emhoff as one of “America’s next fashion ambassadors.” The 25-year-old’s gown seemed to embody a new era of power dressing — one where women don’t need to dress masculine in order to look and feel strong. “I wanted her to stick out, but in a way that was still very elegant and distinguished, and not obnoxious,” said Ando, who said the dress took between 70 and 90 hours to make. “We wanted it to feel like an elegant tea party… a modern princess moment.”

But Ando didn’t see the final look until it was broadcast live on TV, since his and Emhoff’s schedules aligned for just one midnight fitting before her morning flight to Chicago. “She did the fitting with us at midnight, then there were like four hours worth of edits that had to be made,” he said. “I went back to my studio, got it to her at 7 a.m. and then I only got to really see if those edits worked when she walked on stage.”

Outfits by independent designers can sometimes be found on political campaign trails, for those keen-eyed enough to spot them. Eschewing the traditional names of Ralph Lauren, Carolina Herrera and Oscar de la Renta, smaller brands can help those in the limelight to communicate nuanced messaging by supporting emerging talent. At the 2021 inauguration of President Joe Biden, Harris arrived in a Pyer Moss camel coat by Kerby Jean-Raymond — a young Black designer rewriting social narratives around race. First Lady Dr. Jill Biden regularly made a point of wearing smaller, homegrown New York-based designers such as Markarian and Adam Lippes during a time when the industry was recovering from the fallout of COVID-19.

Not only did Emhoff, who is a knitwear designer herself, choose to wear an independent label on the final day of the convention; she had a heavy hand in the finished product. “It was super collaborative,” said Ando, who usually receives minimal feedback from his clients. “But with her, she was very involved.” He sent her several skirt silhouette variations and every fabric option, no matter how slight the difference. “She wanted to see everything. She gave a lot of time to it and was a big part of the design, honestly.”

Before he was designing for the family member of a presidential nominee, Ando was fashioning one-of-a-kind dresses for any celebrity he could find. Armed with a tiny mic, a bashful attitude and an impressive 2.9 million TikTok followers, Ando filmed himself approaching celebrities asking if he could make them a dress. His videos feature everyone from actors Dakota Johnson to Rachel Zegler and Keke Palmer. What ensues is a homespun montage of his sewing process, and often followed by a gratifying try-on reveal.

While he still posts his clumsy dressmaking advances onlines, in reality most of Ando’s work today comes from direct requests made by movie studios and record labels. He also has a lot of clients that he can’t talk about. “A lot of celebrities have a lot of things to worry about,” he said. “(They) have contracts with big fashion brands where a lot of the time they can’t wear other brands at risk of being sued. There’s so many moving parts.” Not every A-lister is up to the task of appearing in one of his TikTok videos either. “For those people, as nice as they are and as gracious as I am that they hired me to do stuff, they might not want to dance in front of a camera. And that’s so reasonable.”

Most young designers get their start through traditional runway shows, with only a lucky few going on to dress celebrities for the odd red carpet event. Ando, by contrast, has built an impressively starry client roster and millions of followers before even launching a brand. (His namesake label will eventually launch in Spring 2025). “Yeah, we did it flipped,” he said.

While Emhoff’s princess frock spawned headlines across the internet, many attributed the look simply to “That TikTok Guy” — a reduction that doesn’t seem to bother Ando. “I don’t need to be Rick Owens,” he said. “I don’t even need you to know my name. I just want you to see the thing and hopefully you appreciate it.”

“People might not take me seriously. I’m very insecure about that,” he added. “But it’s also the most important thing, because people not taking me seriously allows me to just fully dive in. Like if they’re not going seriously to respect me, I kind of have nothing to lose.”"

style,"Adam Sandler, Hollywood’s ultimate dad dresser, doles out fashion advice",2024-08-28,Amarachi Orie,"There’s dadcore, and then there’s Adam Sandler core. And while there is a family resemblance, the two should not be confused.

Dadcore is a fashion trend that prioritizes functional, casual and gently tongue-in-cheek clothing pieces over overtly high-fashion garments. It’s Cole Sprouse in a JW Anderson baseball cap and a blazer; or A$AP Rocky pairing a tie and shirt with jeans. In the dadcore bible — which borrows heavily from menswear trends of the ’80s and ‘90s — comfort may be king, but the sensible sartorial approach is never without thought or style.

Sandler meanwhile, despite earlier this week being spotted with a shopping bag from quiet luxury label Khaite, is mostly just doing Dad: His Fila jacket, basketball shorts and calve-high socks are disarmingly sincere, not ironic.

Yet in a TikTok video posted Monday, the actor and comedian was still asked to dish out his own style advice. “Adam, always got that drip,” says a TikToker who goes by the name “Mystery Fashionist” in the video that has garnered more than 12 million views and more than 2 million likes.

“It just happened, I really didn’t think it through,” Sandler replies. “There’s sneakers, there’s some goofy shorts.” It’s clear the actor — whose eclectic taste has earned him a loyal Gen Z fanbase, with many chronicling their favorite examples of his outfits on TikTok — is authentically unbothered about his newfound fashion credentials. “Whatever is in the closet, I grab it,” he says.

“I think I got a bunch of the same socks, underwear’s kinda similar too. I grab it, I don’t think about it much. Most people make fun of me and my family, but I keep moving,” Sandler adds with a chuckle.

Still, pressed for the five fashion pieces he can’t live without, Sandler replies, “Sometimes my wife gives me nice socks that I throw on — you know, I got my kids on them and stuff.”

Moving onto his color-clashing footwear, Sandler lists his top priority: “Sneakers that fit,” he says. “It don’t matter if they’re dirty or not, as long as they’re fitting and not hurting.” A key dadcore maxim.

Many viewers responded to the video by commenting on how “humble” and “down to earth” Sandler comes across, despite his celebrity status.

“He’s just a normal middle aged dad,” wrote one TikTok user. “Grabs anything from the wardrobe, doesn’t care what it looks like as long as it’s comfy. I love him.”

“He reminds me of my dad lol,” wrote another user.

And though dadcore is nothing new, dads are seemingly having a moment. TikTok’s doting reaction to Sandler compares to how former US President Barack Obama responded to “America’s Dad” Tim Walz relatable off-duty style of flannel shirts and plaid.

Obama joked at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, “I love this guy. Tim is the kind of person who should be in politics,” adding: “You can tell those flannel shirts he wears don’t come from some political consultant. They come from his closet. And they have been through some stuff.”"

style,Naomi Osaka’s subversive US Open walk-on look reclaims girl power,2024-08-27,Leah Dolan,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.

CNN —

For her highly-anticipated return to the US Open, Naomi Osaka is hoping to evoke a touch of magic. The 26-year-old tennis player’s new looks for the court might surprise you.

While modern tennis-wear is typically streamlined, Osaka’s walk-on skirt puffs out wide thanks to a tulle petticoat. In images released ahead of the tournament, she posed in high-shine black bomber jacket adorned with an oversized white bow. There’s a lighter, lime version, too, which she wore in her entrance for her first round against Jeļena Ostapenko. Though she removed the jacket to win the match, she still had bows to spare — one was knotted on the back of her vibrant green tiered skirt, and two more adorning the heels of her sneakers.

“The inspiration that fueled the look for me — and this might be a Japanese term — is feeling like a ‘magical girl’ on the court,” she said in a Nike press statement. “There’s a moment of transformation for me when I walk onto the court, and I have a lot of fun playing, so wanting everyone who sees the outfit to connect with that feeling is a really big motivation for me.”

The frilly, coquettish look — which was custom created by designer Yoon Ahn for Nike — is perhaps a kind of subversive armor for the Japanese star.

Since withdrawing from both the French Open and Wimbledon in 2021, and exiting the US Open at Round 3, the four-time Grand Slam singles champion has taken extended breaks from competitive tennis, prioritizing her mental health and then becoming a mother.

After losing in the qualifiers for the Cincinnati Open earlier this month, the player posted a vulnerable statement to Instagram revealing her internal struggles on the court since having her daughter, Shai, in July 2023.

“My biggest issue currently isn’t losses though, my biggest issue is that I don’t feel like I’m in my body,” she wrote to her 2.8 million followers. “It’s a strange feeling, missing balls I shouldn’t miss, hitting balls softer than I remember I used to… The only feeling I could liken how I feel right now is being postpartum.”

Despite these frustrations, Osaka said she sees the adjustment as a process and that she will continue to put in the work to get where she wants to be. She is playing the US Open for the first time since 2022.

According to Ahn, Osaka’s moodboard for the outfits was largely rooted in the “Lolita goth” community — a lacey, anime-inspired style of dressing that was popularized in 1990s Japan but continues to inspire young people around the world today, with over 31,000 posts on TikTok. “They go out and wear pink, frills, bows, lace,” Ahn told the New York Times. “It’s really about owning the cutesy-ness and the girly-hood.”

In the current fashion landscape, girlhood is having a moment. From the ribbon-laced hiking sneakers of the sold out Sandy Liang x Salomon collaboration to the high-fashion bows of Simone Rocha, Prada and Chanel — overt symbols of youthful femininity are no longer considered reductive or diminishing, but worn with pride and a wink.

“I wouldn’t automatically associate myself with being girlish when I’m on the court,” Osaka told the New York Times. “But I tend to gravitate toward really beautiful and cute things. I think there’s something quite cool in making that an emphasis, especially here in New York. In New York, the tennis court is more like a stage.”

And where there’s ribbon, there’s usually tulle. Just a few days ago, Vice President Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhoff made headlines for the baby blue and white tulle dress she wore on the last day of the Democratic National Convention. Standing alongside Harris’ goddaughter and niece, Emhoff’s frothy look signals a new form of power dressing: Brave in its rejection of expectation and traditional dress codes. Osaka, also embracing tulle, seems to be doing the same.

“We live in a girls’ world, and I wanted to embody that in Naomi’s on-court look,” Ahn said in the press release. The designer has also created a ready-to-wear line for Nike Women that is launching Tuesday. “The collection is an extension of that idea, allowing women to bring out their character and enhance their own personal styles.”

This story was updated with details of Osaka’s first tournament look.

After losing in the qualifiers for the Cincinnati Open earlier this month, the player posted a vulnerable statement to Instagram revealing her internal struggles on the court since having her daughter, Shai, in July 2023.

“My biggest issue currently isn’t losses though, my biggest issue is that I don’t feel like I’m in my body,” she wrote to her 2.8 million followers. “It’s a strange feeling, missing balls I shouldn’t miss, hitting balls softer than I remember I used to… The only feeling I could liken how I feel right now is being postpartum.”

Despite these frustrations, Osaka said she sees the adjustment as a process and that she will continue to put in the work to get where she wants to be. She is playing the US Open for the first time since 2022.

According to Ahn, Osaka’s moodboard for the outfits was largely rooted in the “Lolita goth” community — a lacey, anime-inspired style of dressing that was popularized in 1990s Japan but continues to inspire young people around the world today, with over 31,000 posts on TikTok. “They go out and wear pink, frills, bows, lace,” Ahn told the New York Times. “It’s really about owning the cutesy-ness and the girly-hood.”

In the current fashion landscape, girlhood is having a moment. From the ribbon-laced hiking sneakers of the sold out Sandy Liang x Salomon collaboration to the high-fashion bows of Simone Rocha, Prada and Chanel — overt symbols of youthful femininity are no longer considered reductive or diminishing, but worn with pride and a wink.

“I wouldn’t automatically associate myself with being girlish when I’m on the court,” Osaka told the New York Times. “But I tend to gravitate toward really beautiful and cute things. I think there’s something quite cool in making that an emphasis, especially here in New York. In New York, the tennis court is more like a stage.”

And where there’s ribbon, there’s usually tulle. Just a few days ago, Vice President Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhoff made headlines for the baby blue and white tulle dress she wore on the last day of the Democratic National Convention. Standing alongside Harris’ goddaughter and niece, Emhoff’s frothy look signals a new form of power dressing: Brave in its rejection of expectation and traditional dress codes. Osaka, also embracing tulle, seems to be doing the same.

“We live in a girls’ world, and I wanted to embody that in Naomi’s on-court look,” Ahn said in the press release. The designer has also created a ready-to-wear line for Nike Women that is launching Tuesday. “The collection is an extension of that idea, allowing women to bring out their character and enhance their own personal styles.”

This story was updated with details of Osaka’s first tournament look.

That should come as no surprise to anyone who’s followed Emhoff since Harris took office. Emhoff, who is signed to IMG models and is an artist and fashion designer, has been a boon for high fashion and is poised to only become more influential if she becomes part of the official first family.

However, Emhoff is already affectionately known as the “First Daughter of Bushwick” — Brooklyn’s home for artsy, stick-and-poke-tattooed twentysomethings — having modeled for designers including Proenza Schouler and Maisie Wilen since her breakout moment in an embellished houndstooth ensemble at President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021.

Over the past few nights, the 25-year-old has given clear examples of what we can expect from her if she steps into the role of “first daughter.” On Monday, she wore a sleeveless Helmut Lang scarf top and pleated pants, paired with the campaign’s possibly Chappell Roan-coded camo hunter camp. The next night, it was classic Thom Browne plaid suiting with her naturally curly hair slicked back, carrying a cookie bag from cult brand Puppets and Puppets. “If you saw me cry on tv NO YOU DIDN’T,” she wrote on Instagram that night, showing a clip of her tearing up over her father, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, taking the stage.

On Thursday, Emhoff addressed the convention, telling the crowd that her “Momala” came into her life at 14 years old — “famously a very easy time for a teenager,” she joked, before praising the vice president.

“Like a lot of young people, I didn’t always understand what I was feeling, but no matter what, Kamala was there for me. She was patient, caring and always took me seriously. She’s never stopped listening to me and she’s not going to stop listening to all of us.”

She appeared on the stage with Harris’s niece and goddaughter — reinforcing one of the convention’s themes: the importance of family.

For her speech, she wore an off-the-shoulder asymmetric baby blue and white drop-waist gown with a hand-ruched tulle skirt. It was an undeniably girlish choice for a convention that has showcased myriad twists on feminine power dressing, yet it remained up-to-the-minute stylish. Emhoff paired the look with Gen Z’s favorite combination of tall white socks and black Mary Jane flats, while the bodice was cut just right to expose her patchwork tattoos.

The frock was created by social media personality, actor and designer Joe Ando (who had teased the dress for days online and promptly posted a gleeful reaction video). Ando wrote on Instagram that the dress took three days to make and that Emhoff herself crocheted the piece’s flower detail on the shoulder strap.

What better signal could there be to encourage designers to rethink the dress codes to which female leaders, first ladies and first daughters have previously abided — and usher in a new era of young and modern political power-dressing."

More than halfway through its run, the Eras Tour is now officially the highest-grossing string of concerts of all time, having earnt over $1 billion in revenue from more than four million ticket sales worldwide. So astronomical is Swift’s success, she is less a music megastar than an economic tour de force — with her gigs generating more than $5 billion for local economies, according to the US Travel Association.

Performing a musical oeuvre that spans 18 years, Swift’s three-and-a-half-hour-long set might be a sonic mash-up, but it’s filled with a consistent level of sparkle: Zuhair Murad bodysuits (the latest one unveiled at London featured over 10,000 beads), Ashish sequined T-shirts and Roberto Cavalli crystal embellished skater skirts and bustiers, to name a few. Over the last year, fans have diligently matched Swift’s energy, arriving to shows dripping in sequins, crystals and glitter.

But there have been more than bedazzled leotards on show, too. Swift has donned everything from military jackets to the airy, diaphanous Alberta Ferretti frocks and regal Nicole + Felicia ballgowns — plus we’ve seen a few curveballs from her army of support acts, including Florence Welch, Suki Waterhouse, Hayley Williams and Sabrina Carpenter.

style,Is Kamala Harris’ tan Chloé suit a playful nod to President Obama?,2024-08-20,Oscar Holland,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.

CNN —

In American politics, a tan suit is no longer just a tan suit.

So, when Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention wearing one on Monday evening, the country’s collective memory — or social media’s, at least — instantly recalled one of the shade’s defining moments: Tan-gate.

A decade ago, almost to the day, President Barack Obama enraged a handful of conservative commentators by briefing the press in a light-colored suit. Critics felt his sartorial choice was out of keeping with the gravity of the topic being discussed (namely the US military’s response to a then-flourishing ISIS).

At the time, New York Rep. Peter King told CNN that the suit was a metaphor for Obama’s “lack of seriousness.” Vociferous birtherist Lou Dobbs meanwhile, slammed the outfit as “un-presidential” on Fox News, suggesting on air that it may be transmitting some sort of hidden message, possibly to America’s enemies.

Whether or not Harris intended to evoke a moment now associated with Republican-baiting is a matter of debate. Perhaps that was the point. But when the vice president entered the stage to Beyoncé’s “Freedom” wearing a tan pantsuit and laughing (another source of jibes from her opponents), she almost appeared to be daring critics to call her un-presidential.

Posting to X, comedian John Fugelsang wrote that the outfit would “trigger all the right people.” Meanwhile, former spokesman for Jeb Bush and expert in opposition research Tim Miller suggested she was “baiting Fox (News) into an entire week of tan suit coverage.” Novelist Michael Marshall Smith described the wardrobe decision as “deep cut trolling.”

A less confrontational explanation is that the suit, which Harris paired with a white lavalière blouse, was a fun allusion to an ultimately trivial piece of political history. In a slow August 2014 news week, media outlets embraced tan-gate with headlines like “Yes We Tan!” and “The Audacity of Taupe” (playing on Obama’s slogan and memoir, respectively) and digging up old images of Republican President Ronald Reagan wearing a similar shade. Indeed, if this DNC had been a week later, Harris could have hit the 10-year anniversary on the nose and really set social media ablaze.

Despite having worn a tan suit before, President Barack Obama's light-colored two-piece broke the internet when he wore it in August 2014 to deliver a White House press briefing about the economy, Iraq, and Ukraine. Evan Vucci/AP

Such a nod would be in keeping with a presidential campaign that has thus far benefited from seemingly intentional, meme-able cultural references — from Harris’ embrace of Charli XCX’s “Brat” green to campaign hats that appeared to resemble those produced by pop star Chappell Roan.

Emerging fashion credentials

Of course, the choice of shade may have been purely coincidental. It was not even the only time Harris wore a tan suit in the past week, having done so in Maryland last Thursday when she appeared alongside President Joe Biden for the first time since he announced he will not stand for re-election (though, that time, she paired the two-piece with a black top a chunky gold necklace).

Several online commentators also argued that her DNC outfit was darker than Obama’s, and was in fact camel, not tan. French label Chloé, whose creative director Chemena Kamali custom-designed the wool two-piece, simply described the shade as “brown.”

Color aside, there was plenty else to be read into Harris’ choice of outfit. For one, it marks what appears to be her blossoming relationship with Chloé and Kamali, who in May dressed the vice president in a custom floor-length gown and matching jacket cape for a White House state dinner.

The emerging partnership may be mutually beneficial. Chloé is having something of a cultural moment, with Kamali garnering praise for reinterpreting the codes of modern womenswear since taking the helm in October. In many ways, Harris is her ideal model: A powerful woman of color aiming to dress for an office that has, until now, only known menswear.

For Harris, meanwhile, associating with the French label may help subtly rebut her reputation for unadventurous dressing. Since taking office in 2020, she has sported many variations of the same pantsuit, in various muted colors and for all manner of occasions. But while her DNC suit was still broadly a signature Harris cut in a safe, inoffensive shade, Chloé’s wide lapels and gently flared, floor-length pants made it feel somehow less corporate.

This may be as far as Harris pushes the envelope. And perhaps for good reason. Hillary Clinton, who took to the DNC stage on Monday wearing a not-too-dissimilar shade of cream, wrote in her 2017 memoir: “As a woman running for president, I liked the visual cue that I was different from the men but also familiar. A uniform was also an anti-distraction technique: since there wasn’t much to say or report on what I wore, maybe people would focus on what I was saying instead.”

With Harris set to deliver her keynote convention speech on Thursday, she may, similarly, be hoping her early tan-suited cameo satisfies style commentators and leaves her politics to do the talking."

style,How much is too much to spend on jeans?,2024-08-18,Fiona Sinclair Scott,"Editor’s Note: ‘How Much is too Much?’ offers a guide to making informed shopping decisions across a range of categories including fashion, beauty and luxury.

CNN —

When actor Blake Lively wore a pair of $19,000 designer jeans to a screening of her latest movie, “It Ends with Us,” earlier this summer, the look — covered by several media outlets — attracted plenty of attention. And the price did not go unnoticed. Of course, there were the aghast social media comments, those are to be expected, but the moment also inspired a reasonable question: How much is too much to spend on jeans?

Featuring thigh-to-heel cut-outs and hibiscus-shaped embroidery, the denim pants by Italian fashion house Valentino, were styled with a simple white tank, Christian Louboutin heels, hoop earrings and Lively’s signature long tousled hair. These jeans are something of an outlier, having been designed — undoubtedly — with celebrities and the 1% in mind. They are a conversation starter; they are about fantasy, they are not for the school drop-off.

On fashion retail websites including Net-a-Porter and Ssense, the most expensive jeans listed are nowhere near as pricey, with top figures mostly in the $2,500 to $3,500 range for brands like Jean Paul Gaultier, Dolce & Gabbana and Ralph Lauren. On Valentino’s own site at the time, the next most expensive pair was priced at $2,700 (reduced from $4,500). Still, granted, a lot of money for most people.

Cheaper options are plentiful across the market — from classic $100 Levi’s to newer denim brands, such as MUD Jeans or ELV Denim, emphasizing their sustainable or circular credentials (jeans in this category tend to be priced around $200 to $500.)

So, perhaps the real question is: With such a range in prices, and so many options, how should you decide which jeans are right for you? And what are you really getting for your money?

A brief buyer’s guide

Shopping for a new pair of jeans can be an overwhelming process and — from the style of cut to the wash of the denim — there are many considerations beyond price.

For stylist Becky Malinsky, it’s important to know what you are using your jeans for: “are they for work, or for hanging out with your kids, or are they for going out to dinner,” she said during a phone interview.

A simple Google search generates an overwhelming number of brands and styles to choose from. Malinsky, who also writes the popular “5 Things You Should Buy” newsletter, looks to a few “standout” denim brands to see what they are doing with shape, silhouette and color. From there, “think about where your body type fits within some of these trends,” she said.

“I always look to brands like Citizens of Humanity — I think they do a really good job of fashion and fit. I’m a classic Levi’s wearer and I recommend it to clients all the time. I think the price is right. I also look at what the designers are doing…The Row is really prolific in denim now,” she said.

When shopping, don’t just try the jeans on — stand, walk and sit in them. Comfort is essential if you plan to wear your new purchase in heavy rotation.

Malinsky also emphasized understanding how to strike a balance between style and comfort. Typically, more stretch equates to higher levels of comfort, but too much stretch will compromise shape.

“For someone who still wants a little bit of stretch in their jean I always say look for a straight leg jean or something that’s even a little bit wider. So you can get that comfort factor in your waist…but it’s not going to stretch out like a jegging.”

You may also want to consider sizing up and getting the jeans altered to your specific body shape. Whether you are tall and slim, or short and curvy, finding a good tailor can be transformative when it comes to ensuring any item of clothing is the perfect fit for you.

If you’re wondering how to judge the quality of a denim item, Malinsky said “hand feel” is very important. “Anything that’s too soft, that makes you feel like you’re practically touching a T-shirt is not going to hold up. You want to look for something that has a little resistance to your hand.”

If you’re shopping for men’s jeans, Malinsky advised against the “fake worn” look, instead suggesting a clean, and classic cut in a darker wash. She pointed to Sid Marshall as a great option in the menswear category.

Generally speaking, if you’re looking for a pair that will stand the test of time (as we should all be if we want to be more thoughtful, sustainably-minded consumers), avoid exaggerated stylings such as super-skinny or ultra-wide legs, rips and embellishments. A straight- or sightly tapered-leg, mid-to-high-rise jean in a mid- or slightly darker-toned wash will never go out of style.

The case for spending (a little) more

While there’s no suggestion you should forgo a down payment on your first apartment for a pair of jeans, there is an argument for spending a little more.

“It takes a lot of resources, and many hands, to produce a pair of jeans,” said Sandra Capponi, co-founder of the sustainable fashion site Good on You. “So if we’re buying denim at dirt-cheap prices, then someone or something is paying the price.

“And when you take into account the cost per wear, spending money upfront on high-quality items you’ll wear again and again is often the best choice for your wallet, and for the planet,” she added.

The Good on You website includes a directory of brands, categorized by price and ethical credentials. The site currently features 21 “Great” denim brands (the highest rank, which goes from “Great” down to “We avoid.”)

“It’s incredible, the range for denim,” said Ani Wells, a spokesperson for denim industry watchdog Transformers Foundation, over Zoom. “You can find a pair for $20 and you can find a pair for $20,000. Obviously if you’re looking at a $20 pair of jeans you can imagine that the labor behind it probably wasn’t to the standards that we like to uphold if you’re thinking about the hundreds of hands that touched that pair of jeans; you can imagine that people aren’t getting paid fairly at the other end. You can also imagine that materials used are much cheaper… to get you that price.

Wells believes that $100 to $400 is the “sweet spot” for jeans. “I feel, personally, there are many sustainable brands out there that are producing a really good pair of jeans for around $150 to $200. Once you get past that $400 mark though… I believe you’re really paying for branding.”

Malinsky broadly agreed with this assessment, while echoing the warnings about how very cheap jeans are typically made.

As a consumer, is it OK to pay a premium to buy into your favorite brands? Sure. If money is no object, or you’re feeling flush, treat yourself to a pair of luxury jeans or even Lively’s Valentinos (but you’ll have to be quick, as they are already out of stock in various sizes online).

“For some people (the price of designer denim) is worth it if you’re going to be wearing this jean a ton and this is the foundation of your outfit,” said Malinsky.

Ultimately, you can’t put a price on your very own perfect pair of jeans — those you slide into multiple times a week and always make you feel great. So, shop thoughtfully, question prices under $100, try on everything and don’t worry about what other people are spending.

That said, if you’re still shaking your head at $19,000 jeans in quiet disbelief, remember: Last year, somebody bought a pair of Kurt Cobain’s beat up Levi’s for over $400,000."
style,How much is too much to spend on jeans?,2024-08-18,Fiona Sinclair Scott,"Editor’s Note: ‘How Much is too Much?’ offers a guide to making informed shopping decisions across a range of categories including fashion, beauty and luxury.

CNN —

When actor Blake Lively wore a pair of $19,000 designer jeans to a screening of her latest movie, “It Ends with Us,” earlier this summer, the look — covered by several media outlets — attracted plenty of attention. And the price did not go unnoticed. Of course, there were the aghast social media comments, those are to be expected, but the moment also inspired a reasonable question: How much is too much to spend on jeans?

Featuring thigh-to-heel cut-outs and hibiscus-shaped embroidery, the denim pants by Italian fashion house Valentino, were styled with a simple white tank, Christian Louboutin heels, hoop earrings and Lively’s signature long tousled hair. These jeans are something of an outlier, having been designed — undoubtedly — with celebrities and the 1% in mind. They are a conversation starter; they are about fantasy, they are not for the school drop-off.

On fashion retail websites including Net-a-Porter and Ssense, the most expensive jeans listed are nowhere near as pricey, with top figures mostly in the $2,500 to $3,500 range for brands like Jean Paul Gaultier, Dolce & Gabbana and Ralph Lauren. On Valentino’s own site at the time, the next most expensive pair was priced at $2,700 (reduced from $4,500). Still, granted, a lot of money for most people.

Cheaper options are plentiful across the market — from classic $100 Levi’s to newer denim brands, such as MUD Jeans or ELV Denim, emphasizing their sustainable or circular credentials (jeans in this category tend to be priced around $200 to $500.)

So, perhaps the real question is: With such a range in prices, and so many options, how should you decide which jeans are right for you? And what are you really getting for your money?

A brief buyer’s guide

Shopping for a new pair of jeans can be an overwhelming process and — from the style of cut to the wash of the denim — there are many considerations beyond price.

For stylist Becky Malinsky, it’s important to know what you are using your jeans for: “are they for work, or for hanging out with your kids, or are they for going out to dinner,” she said during a phone interview.

A simple Google search generates an overwhelming number of brands and styles to choose from. Malinsky, who also writes the popular “5 Things You Should Buy” newsletter, looks to a few “standout” denim brands to see what they are doing with shape, silhouette and color. From there, “think about where your body type fits within some of these trends,” she said.

“I always look to brands like Citizens of Humanity — I think they do a really good job of fashion and fit. I’m a classic Levi’s wearer and I recommend it to clients all the time. I think the price is right. I also look at what the designers are doing…The Row is really prolific in denim now,” she said.

When shopping, don’t just try the jeans on — stand, walk and sit in them. Comfort is essential if you plan to wear your new purchase in heavy rotation.

Malinsky also emphasized understanding how to strike a balance between style and comfort. Typically, more stretch equates to higher levels of comfort, but too much stretch will compromise shape.

“For someone who still wants a little bit of stretch in their jean I always say look for a straight leg jean or something that’s even a little bit wider. So you can get that comfort factor in your waist…but it’s not going to stretch out like a jegging.”

style,"The Volkswagen Beetle is hailed as a cult classic, but in Mexico it’s never gone away",2024-08-25,Gordon Cole-Schmidt,"﻿In today’s world of autonomous cars, keyless ignitions and charging ports, it’s hard to imagine just how big the tiny, two-door Volkswagen Beetle once was.

But in Mexico, where the last Beetle rolled off the production line at Volkswagen’s flagship factory in Puebla in 2003, the plucky car lives on. Reinvented and reinvigorated by its cultural legacy, Mexico is one of the few remaining places where a taste of Beetle-fever still exists.

The car’s curvy, colorful exterior and air-cooled, rear engine propelled it to a level of fame and cult status which no petrol car will achieve again. While fond stories of the lovable vehicle roam in our memories, what was once the world’s best-selling car has all but disappeared from American roads, consigned to automotive museums and collector’s forecourts.

Patrolling the sprawling streets of Mexico City, traversing hair-raising mountain roads in Oaxaca’s Sierra Norte, and operating as a converted food truck serving Mexican delicacies, the “Vocho,” as the Beetle is known in Mexico, never left the stage.

Moments before he was interrupted by the signature rumble of a Vocho arriving at the largest Volkswagen event in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, President of the ‘Ixmi Volks Club’, Jesus Delgado told CNN: “When I hear a Vocho’s engine, I see my wife waving goodbye to me on her way to the shops. I see the excitement on my son’s face as I took him for his first driving lesson.” Delgado’s wife died of Covid in 2020, and his sons are all grown up, but according to him, “the emotional memories feel even more real when he’s around the car.”

The first Beetle arrived on Mexican shores in 1954 as part of an exhibition to showcase Germany’s industrial growth. Sales were increasing slowly in the United States, but Volkswagen was battling against post-war anti-German sentiment for the car, which had been conceived under Adolf Hitler’s direction in 1934.

Hitler had entrusted the job of manufacturing a small, affordable car to carmaker Ferdinand Porsche, but the outbreak of World War II halted commercial production. It didn’t restart until 1945, when allied forces discovered the bombed-out remains of a car factory in northern Germany, where a lone Volkswagen Beetle was parked amongst the rubble.

It took a spark of brilliance from Jewish-American advertising executive Julian Koenig for Volkswagen’s tides to change. Alongside his team of sharp-suited Madison Avenue ad-men, he launched their legendary minimalist advertising campaign “Thinking Small”, which shifted the American public away from expensive family wagons to a new reality of small, more fuel-efficient and affordable cars for the masses.

But nobody could have predicted the Beetle’s improbable evolution into a counterculture symbol and talisman of the flower power movement in the US.

As the Vietnam War raged, the Beetle had grown to embody a powerful social movement spawned from anti-war protests across America, and then continued to represent “peace and love” throughout the era, as Beetles arrived in droves at Woodstock Festival 1969. It was an underdog, unapologetically simple and a symbol of anti-capitalist structures lovingly embraced by hippie countercultures. It had, in many ways, grown to represent everything that Nazi Germany would have hated.

A vibrant heritage

By 1972, it was the world’s most-produced car benefiting from the mainstream fame of Disney’s “The Love Bug” and a strong supply chain which included a new factory in Puebla, Mexico, from where it was shipped around the world.

By the time Volkswagen called time on the car’s production in 2003 due to declining sales and a desire to build more modern alternatives, the Beetle had been manufactured in Mexico for more years than it had in Germany.

Shortly after the announcement, BBC News reported that “it has become obvious that its heritage will remain vibrant.”

But since then, tougher air pollution laws and rising fuel costs have gradually taken it off the roads of Europe and in the United States, where the car is serving its final stately chapter away from the public eye, holding its own as a toy for the rich and famous.

Actor, Chris Pratt restored his own 1965 Beetle back in 2016 describing it “as a dream to roll through the Hollywood hills in.” In the same year, comedian, Jerry Seinfeld sold his white 1960 model, equipped with a 36hp engine for $121,000, setting a world record for a Beetle sale. Three years later, fellow Hollywood star, Ewan McGregor spent over $30,000 to convert his Beetle to become fully electric.

But in Mexico, you’re never far from catching a glimpse of the original car signature’s curves and rear engine growl.

Jose Luis, who has been restoring Vochos for 40 years, described how he was “deeply saddened” when the decision was made to stop producing the car. He argued, that “although parts are now more expensive and much harder to find, the appetite for people to own and drive them in Mexico remains unchanged.”

For world-renowned Mexican visual artist, Betsabeé Romero, the car has been instrumental in her career. In her studio in the outskirts of Mexico City, Romero is perched next to one of five hollowed out Vocho shells she will shortly meld together to create a bridge representing the migrant journey.

“The Vocho is a symbol of our heritage and one we can all relate to,” she said. “Every car is a piece of design history; it is uniquely democratic… Many people might have a favorite building but not know the architect or enjoy a style of art but couldn’t tell you about who or when it was created. That’s not the case with the car. We all have a favorite, and we each have a story to tell about it.”

Modern carmakers face a huge challenge in creating a car which can garner a similar level of global attention, but whether it will ever be possible to recreate the Volkswagen Beetle’s unparalleled cult-status remains to be seen."

style,New York City is one step closer to getting its long-awaited floating + POOL,2024-08-15,Jacqui Palumbo,"For nearly a decade and a half, New Yorkers have awaited the arrival of a self-filtering, cross-shaped pool floating in the city’s East River after the proposal was partially crowdfunded and eventually approved by the city.

Now the futuristic design has an official home. Last week, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams announced that the summertime facility, called + POOL, will be built at Pier 35, near Manhattan’s Lower East Side — though swimmers may need to wait until summer 2026 for opening day.

The pool’s filtration system, which is expected to clean more than a million gallons of river water daily without the use of chemicals or additives, per a project press release, will undergo two rounds of testing. The first will begin this month on a floating barge in the waters close to Pier 35; next year, a portion of the open-air pool will be built to carry out the final tests.

This past January, Governor Hochul announced a major breakthrough for the project by way of $16 million in joint city and state funding, part of a statewide $150 million initiative called NY SWIMS. Mayor Adams said in a press statement that + POOL will help expand “equitable access to swimming for all New Yorkers, especially our children.”

The city of more than 8.3 million people only maintains around 50 public pools deep enough to swim in, according to New York City Council data from 2022, creating long lines during summers amid longer and more intense heat waves.

+ POOL's design can be configured multiple ways, hosting up to 300 swimmers at a time. + POOL rendering. Designed by Family New York & Playlab, Inc. Image by Family New York

Originally the idea of architect Dong-Ping Wong, who collaborated with designers from the creative studio PlayLab and the now-defunct firm Family, + POOL was conceived as an ambitious and eye-catching way to open the city’s waterways for public use. Once built, the 9,000-square-foot cross-shaped pool will be able to accommodate up to 300 swimmers at a time and can be divided into four sections for activities such as children’s swimming, lounging, laps and sports. The design can also be configured lengthwise to offer Olympic-sized lanes, or the four “arms” of the cross can be connected into a single large pool.

Layers of “filtration membranes” will not only make the water safe for swimming but will clean the surrounding river, too, according to Friends of + POOL, the nonprofit organization that the designers co-founded in 2015 as they expanded their team and appointed new board members.

Keeping community focus

The pool was the first civic architecture proposal to launch through Kickstarter, according to the project, which raised over $300,000 through the crowdfunding site between 2011 and 2014 to fund testing. An early estimate in 2011 put the total cost of the project at $21 million, though Kara Meyer, managing director of Friends of + POOL, told CNN over email that this figure has since increased to around $50 million, with a more detailed cost estimate still to come.

“One of the most beautiful things about this project is that it has truly been community-driven,” Meyer said. “We kickstarted the project with thousands of small donations and the nonprofit continues to raise small-level funds from a vast array of community members that want access to their rivers and believe in the work we are doing around water safety education and water stewardship.”

But, following Governor Hochul’s announcement in January, Wong wrote an Instagram post expressing various concerns, including a “lack of diversity” on the + POOL board. While he welcomed the $16 million funding as “a huge and commendable commitment from the City and State,” he questioned whether the public facility would properly serve the nearby Chinatown community, “the majority of whom are people of color and lower income,” he explained.

After last week’s announcement, Wong told CNN in an email that he has been replaced on the project by other architects. Meyer refuted the claim he had been “frozen out,” telling CNN the project had evolved beyond the design stage, which Wong had “focused on,” to encompass engineering, programming and advocacy work. “From the organization’s perspective, up until he declared publicly he was not, he was always a key part of the project,” said Meyer. Wong’s name still appears on the +POOL website.

Meyer added that four of the nonprofit’s 10 board members “identify as women and people of color,” and pointed to the organization’s community partnerships, including free swim lessons for local schoolchildren and workforce programs for residents, who she said will be trained for roles in lifeguarding, filtration system maintenance and water-quality testing, among others.

“Considering the horrific history of racial discrimination that has impacted America’s public pools, our commitment to accountability to the community and providing access where it’s lacking guides all of our decisions with the communities we serve,” she said.

Though New Yorkers should see the pool taking shape off of Pier 35 as testing finishes up next year, an exact timeline for its completion is yet to be announced. By helping filter a historically polluted river, organizers hope the project will offer “new frameworks” for the city to make use of its rivers in creative ways.

“One of the most beautiful things about this project is that it has truly been community-driven,” Meyer said. “We kickstarted the project with thousands of small donations and the nonprofit continues to raise small-level funds from a vast array of community members that want access to their rivers and believe in the work we are doing around water safety education and water stewardship.”

But, following Governor Hochul’s announcement in January, Wong wrote an Instagram post expressing various concerns, including a “lack of diversity” on the + POOL board. While he welcomed the $16 million funding as “a huge and commendable commitment from the City and State,” he questioned whether the public facility would properly serve the nearby Chinatown community, “the majority of whom are people of color and lower income,” he explained.

After last week’s announcement, Wong told CNN in an email that he has been replaced on the project by other architects. Meyer refuted the claim he had been “frozen out,” telling CNN the project had evolved beyond the design stage, which Wong had “focused on,” to encompass engineering, programming and advocacy work. “From the organization’s perspective, up until he declared publicly he was not, he was always a key part of the project,” said Meyer. Wong’s name still appears on the +POOL website.

Meyer added that four of the nonprofit’s 10 board members “identify as women and people of color,” and pointed to the organization’s community partnerships, including free swim lessons for local schoolchildren and workforce programs for residents, who she said will be trained for roles in lifeguarding, filtration system maintenance and water-quality testing, among others.

“Considering the horrific history of racial discrimination that has impacted America’s public pools, our commitment to accountability to the community and providing access where it’s lacking guides all of our decisions with the communities we serve,” she said.

Though New Yorkers should see the pool taking shape off of Pier 35 as testing finishes up next year, an exact timeline for its completion is yet to be announced. By helping filter a historically polluted river, organizers hope the project will offer “new frameworks” for the city to make use of its rivers in creative ways.

style,What is Brat summer? How an ‘off-putting’ shade of green shaded the internet and beyond,2024-07-23,Leah Dolan,"A specific shade of retina-singeing chartreuse has become the defining color of summer 2024. Similar to the text message bubble sent from your iPhone, the vivid hue sits somewhere between 360 and 375 on the Pantone color chart. It is, of course, Brat green.

Now synonymous with British pop star Charli XCX’s chart-topping studio album, the cultural influence of “Brat” green knows no bounds. Last week, the official X account of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority alerted commuters of train repairs using a “Brat” green graphic. 65-year-old Golden Globe-winning actor Kyle McLachlan posted an “unofficial music video” of himself lip syncing to a track from the album in a fluorescent green shirt.

It has even crept into Vice President Kamala Harris’ universe. After President Joe Biden announced he would no longer be seeking re-election and instead endorsing Kamala Harris, Charli XCX took to X to offer her own seal of approval, proclaiming: “kamala IS brat.” Memes swiftly followed, as well as impossibly fast t-shirts with Harris’ name printed in the style of the “Brat” album cover. Even the Vice President’s official rapid response account on X, @kamalahq, is now topped with a “Brat” style banner.

Brat girl summer

The hashtag #Bratsummer has been tagged in over 40,000 videos on TikTok and 12,000 posts on Instagram. The term has also been on a steady incline worldwide, according to Google Trends, since the first week of June. Google even predicts searches for “Brat summer” will reach their maximum popularity this week.

The term “Brat girl summer” can be understood best as a battle cry — uniting all hedonists, fun-lovers and “365 Party Girls.” Last month, Charli XCX outlined the ingredients for a Brat girl summer to the BBC, citing “a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.” Some might consider Kamala Harris becoming the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major party ticket as Brat, because it’s boundary-breaking, feminine and intersectional. At its core, embracing Brat culture is about messy, imperfect self-acceptance — and it’s the easiest way right now to engage the under-30 demographic.

As a result, the past weeks have become awash with lurid green, and fast. “It used to be that brands picked a color, but then it would be years before somebody associates that color with your brand,” said Sunita Yeomans, leader of the Graphic Branding and Identity course at London College of Communication, in a video interview. Yeoman believes Charli XCX has managed to fast-track the process with “spectacular” success. She recently noticed a colleague was inadvertently wearing Brat green during an art gallery board meeting. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, she doesn’t even realize she’s wearing that color.’ It got me thinking about when people don’t even realize that they’re endorsing (something).”

This isn’t the first summer to have been color-coded by pop culture, either; it’s the second in a row. Last year, moviegoers worldwide sported Barbie pink looks to see Greta Gerwig’s record-smashing “Barbie” film, and it also hit red carpets and shaded music videos including Ice Spice’s pink dreamhouse backdrop in “Princess Diana.” Pinterest searches for “Barbie pink” in both the US and UK were up 100% in 2023 compared to 2024, and fashion search engine Lyst named pink their trend of the year in 2022, thanks to a 416% increase in searches for hot pink clothing.

But what goes into creating an era-defining shade? “Color is a language,” said Laurie Pressman, vice president of Pantone. “We gravitate towards color, and our relationship with color oftentimes happens outside of our consciousness.”

The color authority was partly responsible for the world domination of Barbie pink months before the film even premiered. For Valentino’s fall-winter runway in March 2022, Pressman and her team collaborated with Pier Paolo Piccioli, the fashion house’s creative director at the time, for the hue “Pink PP” (colloquially known as “Valentino pink”) — the sole color used in the collection. It became the shade du jour: Florence Pugh made headlines in a sheer tulle Valentino Pink number for the label’s haute couture show in that July; while earlier in the year, not one but three celebrities arrived at the Met Gala dressed in the shade.

“(Piccioli) wanted this (color) to be a cultural touchstone,” Pressman told CNN in a video interview, adding that it’s “about being bold” and “standing out.” And, as a sister shade to red, she pointed out, it expanded the brand’s legacy with the color Rosso Valentino.

Although Pantone were also the ones who standardized 219C — better known as Barbie pink — in the 1990s, Pressman insists Valentino pink’s serendipitous overlap with the “Barbie” marketing machine was “a complete coincidence.” Plus, the two shades are different, with Barbie pink being “a little bit more neon,” she said.

Building the ‘Bratosphere’

While Barbie pink has a long, storied history, Brat green is fresh out the gates. It was created by design studio Special Offer Inc., who spent months discussing the shade, eventually selecting Brat green from around 500 options, according to founder Brent David Freaney.

“Charli knew exactly what she wanted, probably long before she even engaged with us,” Freaney told CNN in a phone interview. “We spent months just talking about color and color references. ‘What does this shade of green mean versus this shade of green? What’s the connotation?’” While walking around New York City, Freaney would stop to take photos of any green object that might fit in the ‘bratosphere’ — a term coined by Charli XCX herself. “Then I’d take (these pictures) to my computer and use the (Photoshop) eyedropper tool to make that green and present it. Like, ‘I saw this traffic cone outside. What do we think about that?’”

Fans on social media are documenting the verdant shade out in the wild. @accidentallybrat/Instagram

For Yeoman, the science of a summer-stealing color mostly boils down to how a shade performs online and IRL. “If you look at Brat green on a screen, it zings,” she said. “Barbie pink does the same thing. It’s about finding a shade that works both when it’s backlit on a screen and also in real life.”

Freaney says they didn’t want a shade that felt conventional. “We knew we didn’t want a darker green or a mint green,” he told CNN. “We were like, ‘Let’s choose something that feels really off-putting.”

Because of the color’s specificity, spotting it out in the wild — much like Freaney’s research process — has become a surefire way to go viral and add to the bratosphere. Stephanie, a Charli XCX fan based in New York, created the Instagram account @accidentallybrat in June, just after the album’s release, and now receives photo submissions of Brat green sightings from friends and other fans. Her posts include a stack of Lime bikes, an estate sale poster and a pyromorphite mineral in a science museum.

“It’s just so fun,” she told CNN over email. “Every time I’m with a friend walking on the street someone stops to yell, ‘Brat!’ when we see anything green. It’s so iconic and eye-catching — if you see anything online with that color you immediately know what it’s referencing.”

A colorful future

Though Pantone has been quietly creating specific shades for musicians for decades — Pressman has standardized everything from Rolling Stones red to Prince purple, though it’s up to brands if they want to enter into the elusive trademarking process themselves — Pressman thinks both artists and audiences are increasingly paying attention to color.

The specific shade of lavender Olivia Rodrgio has worn on several red carpets, including the 2022 Met Gala, is the same hue of her latest album “Guts,” and the color of most of her merchandise. Ice Spice, too, has become synonymous with her mop of fiery orange hair — and often matches her step-and-repeat looks to the shade. “Some of these very young artists who are really looking to express themselves and are turning to color as one more way to get their message out,” Pressman said. “Which I think is very savvy.”

Brat green might have claimed this summer, but the color wheel will spin again before long. “That’s just the way the design industry works,” said Yeomans, who believes more labels will scramble to brand summer 2025. “Everyone always catches onto a trend, and then everyone tries to do it, but only a handful will actually succeed.”"

style,"The Volkswagen Beetle is hailed as a cult classic, but in Mexico it’s never gone away",2024-08-25,Gordon Cole-Schmidt,"﻿In today’s world of autonomous cars, keyless ignitions and charging ports, it’s hard to imagine just how big the tiny, two-door Volkswagen Beetle once was.

But in Mexico, where the last Beetle rolled off the production line at Volkswagen’s flagship factory in Puebla in 2003, the plucky car lives on. Reinvented and reinvigorated by its cultural legacy, Mexico is one of the few remaining places where a taste of Beetle-fever still exists.

The car’s curvy, colorful exterior and air-cooled, rear engine propelled it to a level of fame and cult status which no petrol car will achieve again. While fond stories of the lovable vehicle roam in our memories, what was once the world’s best-selling car has all but disappeared from American roads, consigned to automotive museums and collector’s forecourts.

Patrolling the sprawling streets of Mexico City, traversing hair-raising mountain roads in Oaxaca’s Sierra Norte, and operating as a converted food truck serving Mexican delicacies, the “Vocho,” as the Beetle is known in Mexico, never left the stage.

Moments before he was interrupted by the signature rumble of a Vocho arriving at the largest Volkswagen event in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, President of the ‘Ixmi Volks Club’, Jesus Delgado told CNN: “When I hear a Vocho’s engine, I see my wife waving goodbye to me on her way to the shops. I see the excitement on my son’s face as I took him for his first driving lesson.” Delgado’s wife died of Covid in 2020, and his sons are all grown up, but according to him, “the emotional memories feel even more real when he’s around the car.”

The first Beetle arrived on Mexican shores in 1954 as part of an exhibition to showcase Germany’s industrial growth. Sales were increasing slowly in the United States, but Volkswagen was battling against post-war anti-German sentiment for the car, which had been conceived under Adolf Hitler’s direction in 1934.

Hitler had entrusted the job of manufacturing a small, affordable car to carmaker Ferdinand Porsche, but the outbreak of World War II halted commercial production. It didn’t restart until 1945, when allied forces discovered the bombed-out remains of a car factory in northern Germany, where a lone Volkswagen Beetle was parked amongst the rubble.

It took a spark of brilliance from Jewish-American advertising executive Julian Koenig for Volkswagen’s tides to change. Alongside his team of sharp-suited Madison Avenue ad-men, he launched their legendary minimalist advertising campaign “Thinking Small”, which shifted the American public away from expensive family wagons to a new reality of small, more fuel-efficient and affordable cars for the masses.

But nobody could have predicted the Beetle’s improbable evolution into a counterculture symbol and talisman of the flower power movement in the US.

As the Vietnam War raged, the Beetle had grown to embody a powerful social movement spawned from anti-war protests across America, and then continued to represent “peace and love” throughout the era, as Beetles arrived in droves at Woodstock Festival 1969. It was an underdog, unapologetically simple and a symbol of anti-capitalist structures lovingly embraced by hippie countercultures. It had, in many ways, grown to represent everything that Nazi Germany would have hated.

A vibrant heritage

By 1972, it was the world’s most-produced car benefiting from the mainstream fame of Disney’s “The Love Bug” and a strong supply chain which included a new factory in Puebla, Mexico, from where it was shipped around the world.

By the time Volkswagen called time on the car’s production in 2003 due to declining sales and a desire to build more modern alternatives, the Beetle had been manufactured in Mexico for more years than it had in Germany.

Shortly after the announcement, BBC News reported that “it has become obvious that its heritage will remain vibrant.”

But since then, tougher air pollution laws and rising fuel costs have gradually taken it off the roads of Europe and in the United States, where the car is serving its final stately chapter away from the public eye, holding its own as a toy for the rich and famous.

Actor, Chris Pratt restored his own 1965 Beetle back in 2016 describing it “as a dream to roll through the Hollywood hills in.” In the same year, comedian, Jerry Seinfeld sold his white 1960 model, equipped with a 36hp engine for $121,000, setting a world record for a Beetle sale. Three years later, fellow Hollywood star, Ewan McGregor spent over $30,000 to convert his Beetle to become fully electric.

But in Mexico, you’re never far from catching a glimpse of the original car signature’s curves and rear engine growl.

Jose Luis, who has been restoring Vochos for 40 years, described how he was “deeply saddened” when the decision was made to stop producing the car. He argued, that “although parts are now more expensive and much harder to find, the appetite for people to own and drive them in Mexico remains unchanged.”

For world-renowned Mexican visual artist, Betsabeé Romero, the car has been instrumental in her career. In her studio in the outskirts of Mexico City, Romero is perched next to one of five hollowed out Vocho shells she will shortly meld together to create a bridge representing the migrant journey.

“The Vocho is a symbol of our heritage and one we can all relate to,” she said. “Every car is a piece of design history; it is uniquely democratic… Many people might have a favorite building but not know the architect or enjoy a style of art but couldn’t tell you about who or when it was created. That’s not the case with the car. We all have a favorite, and we each have a story to tell about it.”

Modern carmakers face a huge challenge in creating a car which can garner a similar level of global attention, but whether it will ever be possible to recreate the Volkswagen Beetle’s unparalleled cult-status remains to be seen."

For world-renowned Mexican visual artist, Betsabeé Romero, the car has been instrumental in her career. In her studio in the outskirts of Mexico City, Romero is perched next to one of five hollowed out Vocho shells she will shortly meld together to create a bridge representing the migrant journey.

“The Vocho is a symbol of our heritage and one we can all relate to,” she said. “Every car is a piece of design history; it is uniquely democratic… Many people might have a favorite building but not know the architect or enjoy a style of art but couldn’t tell you about who or when it was created. That’s not the case with the car. We all have a favorite, and we each have a story to tell about it.”

Modern carmakers face a huge challenge in creating a car which can garner a similar level of global attention, but whether it will ever be possible to recreate the Volkswagen Beetle’s unparalleled cult-status remains to be seen."
style,New York City is one step closer to getting its long-awaited floating + POOL,2024-08-15,Jacqui Palumbo,"For nearly a decade and a half, New Yorkers have awaited the arrival of a self-filtering, cross-shaped pool floating in the city’s East River after the proposal was partially crowdfunded and eventually approved by the city.

Now the futuristic design has an official home. Last week, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams announced that the summertime facility, called + POOL, will be built at Pier 35, near Manhattan’s Lower East Side — though swimmers may need to wait until summer 2026 for opening day.

The pool’s filtration system, which is expected to clean more than a million gallons of river water daily without the use of chemicals or additives, per a project press release, will undergo two rounds of testing. The first will begin this month on a floating barge in the waters close to Pier 35; next year, a portion of the open-air pool will be built to carry out the final tests.

This past January, Governor Hochul announced a major breakthrough for the project by way of $16 million in joint city and state funding, part of a statewide $150 million initiative called NY SWIMS. Mayor Adams said in a press statement that + POOL will help expand “equitable access to swimming for all New Yorkers, especially our children.”

The city of more than 8.3 million people only maintains around 50 public pools deep enough to swim in, according to New York City Council data from 2022, creating long lines during summers amid longer and more intense heat waves.

+ POOL's design can be configured multiple ways, hosting up to 300 swimmers at a time. + POOL rendering. Designed by Family New York & Playlab, Inc. Image by Family New York

Originally the idea of architect Dong-Ping Wong, who collaborated with designers from the creative studio PlayLab and the now-defunct firm Family, + POOL was conceived as an ambitious and eye-catching way to open the city’s waterways for public use. Once built, the 9,000-square-foot cross-shaped pool will be able to accommodate up to 300 swimmers at a time and can be divided into four sections for activities such as children’s swimming, lounging, laps and sports. The design can also be configured lengthwise to offer Olympic-sized lanes, or the four “arms” of the cross can be connected into a single large pool.

Layers of “filtration membranes” will not only make the water safe for swimming but will clean the surrounding river, too, according to Friends of + POOL, the nonprofit organization that the designers co-founded in 2015 as they expanded their team and appointed new board members.

Keeping community focus

The pool was the first civic architecture proposal to launch through Kickstarter, according to the project, which raised over $300,000 through the crowdfunding site between 2011 and 2014 to fund testing. An early estimate in 2011 put the total cost of the project at $21 million, though Kara Meyer, managing director of Friends of + POOL, told CNN over email that this figure has since increased to around $50 million, with a more detailed cost estimate still to come.

“One of the most beautiful things about this project is that it has truly been community-driven,” Meyer said. “We kickstarted the project with thousands of small donations and the nonprofit continues to raise small-level funds from a vast array of community members that want access to their rivers and believe in the work we are doing around water safety education and water stewardship.”

But, following Governor Hochul’s announcement in January, Wong wrote an Instagram post expressing various concerns, including a “lack of diversity” on the + POOL board. While he welcomed the $16 million funding as “a huge and commendable commitment from the City and State,” he questioned whether the public facility would properly serve the nearby Chinatown community, “the majority of whom are people of color and lower income,” he explained.

After last week’s announcement, Wong told CNN in an email that he has been replaced on the project by other architects. Meyer refuted the claim he had been “frozen out,” telling CNN the project had evolved beyond the design stage, which Wong had “focused on,” to encompass engineering, programming and advocacy work. “From the organization’s perspective, up until he declared publicly he was not, he was always a key part of the project,” said Meyer. Wong’s name still appears on the +POOL website.

Meyer added that four of the nonprofit’s 10 board members “identify as women and people of color,” and pointed to the organization’s community partnerships, including free swim lessons for local schoolchildren and workforce programs for residents, who she said will be trained for roles in lifeguarding, filtration system maintenance and water-quality testing, among others.

“Considering the horrific history of racial discrimination that has impacted America’s public pools, our commitment to accountability to the community and providing access where it’s lacking guides all of our decisions with the communities we serve,” she said.

Though New Yorkers should see the pool taking shape off of Pier 35 as testing finishes up next year, an exact timeline for its completion is yet to be announced. By helping filter a historically polluted river, organizers hope the project will offer “new frameworks” for the city to make use of its rivers in creative ways.

style,What is Brat summer? How an ‘off-putting’ shade of green shaded the internet and beyond,2024-07-23,Leah Dolan,"A specific shade of retina-singeing chartreuse has become the defining color of summer 2024. Similar to the text message bubble sent from your iPhone, the vivid hue sits somewhere between 360 and 375 on the Pantone color chart. It is, of course, Brat green.

Now synonymous with British pop star Charli XCX’s chart-topping studio album, the cultural influence of “Brat” green knows no bounds. Last week, the official X account of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority alerted commuters of train repairs using a “Brat” green graphic. 65-year-old Golden Globe-winning actor Kyle McLachlan posted an “unofficial music video” of himself lip syncing to a track from the album in a fluorescent green shirt.

It has even crept into Vice President Kamala Harris’ universe. After President Joe Biden announced he would no longer be seeking re-election and instead endorsing Kamala Harris, Charli XCX took to X to offer her own seal of approval, proclaiming: “kamala IS brat.” Memes swiftly followed, as well as impossibly fast t-shirts with Harris’ name printed in the style of the “Brat” album cover. Even the Vice President’s official rapid response account on X, @kamalahq, is now topped with a “Brat” style banner.

Brat girl summer

The hashtag #Bratsummer has been tagged in over 40,000 videos on TikTok and 12,000 posts on Instagram. The term has also been on a steady incline worldwide, according to Google Trends, since the first week of June. Google even predicts searches for “Brat summer” will reach their maximum popularity this week.

The term “Brat girl summer” can be understood best as a battle cry — uniting all hedonists, fun-lovers and “365 Party Girls.” Last month, Charli XCX outlined the ingredients for a Brat girl summer to the BBC, citing “a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.” Some might consider Kamala Harris becoming the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major party ticket as Brat, because it’s boundary-breaking, feminine and intersectional. At its core, embracing Brat culture is about messy, imperfect self-acceptance — and it’s the easiest way right now to engage the under-30 demographic.

As a result, the past weeks have become awash with lurid green, and fast. “It used to be that brands picked a color, but then it would be years before somebody associates that color with your brand,” said Sunita Yeomans, leader of the Graphic Branding and Identity course at London College of Communication, in a video interview. Yeoman believes Charli XCX has managed to fast-track the process with “spectacular” success. She recently noticed a colleague was inadvertently wearing Brat green during an art gallery board meeting. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, she doesn’t even realize she’s wearing that color.’ It got me thinking about when people don’t even realize that they’re endorsing (something).”

This isn’t the first summer to have been color-coded by pop culture, either; it’s the second in a row. Last year, moviegoers worldwide sported Barbie pink looks to see Greta Gerwig’s record-smashing “Barbie” film, and it also hit red carpets and shaded music videos including Ice Spice’s pink dreamhouse backdrop in “Princess Diana.” Pinterest searches for “Barbie pink” in both the US and UK were up 100% in 2023 compared to 2024, and fashion search engine Lyst named pink their trend of the year in 2022, thanks to a 416% increase in searches for hot pink clothing.

But what goes into creating an era-defining shade? “Color is a language,” said Laurie Pressman, vice president of Pantone. “We gravitate towards color, and our relationship with color oftentimes happens outside of our consciousness.”

The color authority was partly responsible for the world domination of Barbie pink months before the film even premiered. For Valentino’s fall-winter runway in March 2022, Pressman and her team collaborated with Pier Paolo Piccioli, the fashion house’s creative director at the time, for the hue “Pink PP” (colloquially known as “Valentino pink”) — the sole color used in the collection. It became the shade du jour: Florence Pugh made headlines in a sheer tulle Valentino Pink number for the label’s haute couture show in that July; while earlier in the year, not one but three celebrities arrived at the Met Gala dressed in the shade.

“(Piccioli) wanted this (color) to be a cultural touchstone,” Pressman told CNN in a video interview, adding that it’s “about being bold” and “standing out.” And, as a sister shade to red, she pointed out, it expanded the brand’s legacy with the color Rosso Valentino.

Although Pantone were also the ones who standardized 219C — better known as Barbie pink — in the 1990s, Pressman insists Valentino pink’s serendipitous overlap with the “Barbie” marketing machine was “a complete coincidence.” Plus, the two shades are different, with Barbie pink being “a little bit more neon,” she said.

Building the ‘Bratosphere’

While Barbie pink has a long, storied history, Brat green is fresh out the gates. It was created by design studio Special Offer Inc., who spent months discussing the shade, eventually selecting Brat green from around 500 options, according to founder Brent David Freaney.

“Charli knew exactly what she wanted, probably long before she even engaged with us,” Freaney told CNN in a phone interview. “We spent months just talking about color and color references. ‘What does this shade of green mean versus this shade of green? What’s the connotation?’” While walking around New York City, Freaney would stop to take photos of any green object that might fit in the ‘bratosphere’ — a term coined by Charli XCX herself. “Then I’d take (these pictures) to my computer and use the (Photoshop) eyedropper tool to make that green and present it. Like, ‘I saw this traffic cone outside. What do we think about that?’”

Fans on social media are documenting the verdant shade out in the wild. @accidentallybrat/Instagram

For Yeoman, the science of a summer-stealing color mostly boils down to how a shade performs online and IRL. “If you look at Brat green on a screen, it zings,” she said. “Barbie pink does the same thing. It’s about finding a shade that works both when it’s backlit on a screen and also in real life.”

Freaney says they didn’t want a shade that felt conventional. “We knew we didn’t want a darker green or a mint green,” he told CNN. “We were like, ‘Let’s choose something that feels really off-putting.”

Because of the color’s specificity, spotting it out in the wild — much like Freaney’s research process — has become a surefire way to go viral and add to the bratosphere. Stephanie, a Charli XCX fan based in New York, created the Instagram account @accidentallybrat in June, just after the album’s release, and now receives photo submissions of Brat green sightings from friends and other fans. Her posts include a stack of Lime bikes, an estate sale poster and a pyromorphite mineral in a science museum.

“It’s just so fun,” she told CNN over email. “Every time I’m with a friend walking on the street someone stops to yell, ‘Brat!’ when we see anything green. It’s so iconic and eye-catching — if you see anything online with that color you immediately know what it’s referencing.”

A colorful future

Though Pantone has been quietly creating specific shades for musicians for decades — Pressman has standardized everything from Rolling Stones red to Prince purple, though it’s up to brands if they want to enter into the elusive trademarking process themselves — Pressman thinks both artists and audiences are increasingly paying attention to color.

The specific shade of lavender Olivia Rodrgio has worn on several red carpets, including the 2022 Met Gala, is the same hue of her latest album “Guts,” and the color of most of her merchandise. Ice Spice, too, has become synonymous with her mop of fiery orange hair — and often matches her step-and-repeat looks to the shade. “Some of these very young artists who are really looking to express themselves and are turning to color as one more way to get their message out,” Pressman said. “Which I think is very savvy.”

Brat green might have claimed this summer, but the color wheel will spin again before long. “That’s just the way the design industry works,” said Yeomans, who believes more labels will scramble to brand summer 2025. “Everyone always catches onto a trend, and then everyone tries to do it, but only a handful will actually succeed.”"

Chidimma Adetshina, a beauty pageant contestant who faced a wave of hostility in South Africa after questions arose about her nationality, has been crowned Miss Universe Nigeria.

Adetshina, age 23, triumphed at the pageant held in Lagos on Saturday night. She will represent Nigeria in the Miss Universe competition in Mexico in November.

Last month, she quit the Miss South Africa contest after becoming the target of xenophobic online attacks and later accepted an invitation to compete in the Nigerian pageant.

Many South Africans had questioned her eligibility to participate in their country’s contest after reports emerged that she was born to a Nigerian father and a South African mother with Mozambican roots.

Organizers of Miss Universe Nigeria said at the time that Adetshina’s invitation was “an opportunity to represent her father’s native land on an international stage.” They added that her “journey in pageantry is far from over.”

Writing on Instagram after her victory, Adetshina said it was “a dream come true,” describing the crown as “not just a symbol of beauty” but “a call to action” for a united Africa.

“As I accept this honor, I want to share a vision that burns deeply within me, a vision of African unity and peaceful coexistence!” she wrote in a statement on her Instagram page.

“Let’s break down the barriers that divide us. Let’s foster a continent where every African can move freely without prejudice, pursue their dreams, and contribute to the growth and prosperity of our great continent,” the statement added.

South African authorities say they are working to clarify Adetshina’s citizenship status after the country’s Home Affairs department, which oversees immigration, said her mother may have committed identity fraud to obtain South African citizenship in 2001.

The department, however, exonerated Adetshina of any wrongdoing, saying she was just an infant at the time."

Organizers of Miss Universe Nigeria said at the time that Adetshina’s invitation was “an opportunity to represent her father’s native land on an international stage.” They added that her “journey in pageantry is far from over.”

Writing on Instagram after her victory, Adetshina said it was “a dream come true,” describing the crown as “not just a symbol of beauty” but “a call to action” for a united Africa.

“As I accept this honor, I want to share a vision that burns deeply within me, a vision of African unity and peaceful coexistence!” she wrote in a statement on her Instagram page.

“Let’s break down the barriers that divide us. Let’s foster a continent where every African can move freely without prejudice, pursue their dreams, and contribute to the growth and prosperity of our great continent,” the statement added.

South African authorities say they are working to clarify Adetshina’s citizenship status after the country’s Home Affairs department, which oversees immigration, said her mother may have committed identity fraud to obtain South African citizenship in 2001.

The department, however, exonerated Adetshina of any wrongdoing, saying she was just an infant at the time."
style,"Thin eyebrows are back, but should they be?",2024-08-22,Martha Alexander,"Good news for anyone who permanently decimated their eyebrows in the 1990s with a pair of tweezers and bad lighting: the barely-there brow is making a comeback.

Big browed beauties like Cara Delevingne and Zoe Kravitz have shaped grooming standards for well over a decade — but if trend forecasts and red carpets are anything to go by, less is more once again.

The 90s beauty redux is evident everywhere from TikTok to Paris Fashion Week where earlier this year, make-up artist Pat McGrath painted the finest of curved lines high on the models’ foreheads for the Maison Margiela show, concealing their natural eyebrows below. Then in May, the Met Gala was awash with barely-there brows, with Zendaya, FKA Twigs and Doja Cat each opting for either bleached out or wafer-thin styles.

But what suits the bone structure of supermodel or Hollywood starlet can often end up looking decidedly different on mere mortals.

“I’ve definitely noticed the return of the skinny brow, but today’s version focuses on sculpting and accentuating your features rather than tweezing them pencil thin,” says British brow artist Hollie Parkes. “If you’re considering slimming your brow, I highly recommend booking an appointment with an expert.”

While the skinny brow look is being increasingly seen on social media, brow expert Kamini Vaghela who has been threading the eyebrows of A-listers and royals from her London salon for over 35 years, warns against imitating anyone else when it comes to beauty.

Eyebrows are, she said, completely individual and need to be treated as such, no matter what fashion tells us to do. She recalls seeing an image of Twiggy at the height of her fame in the 1960s and honing in on her eyebrows.

“I took one look at her — she had thin pale eyebrows which suited her — and I knew so many women were going to copy her and look completely ludicrous,” she said in a phone interview. “I don’t believe in eyebrow trends at all. It’s about what suits the individual — no shape can suit everyone.”

Kamini, who was born and raised in Zimbabwe but is of Indian heritage, credits herself with bringing threading to the West in 2001 and works on the basis that eyebrow form should be based on bone structure, eye shape, skin tone and hair colour.

“My eyebrows have never recovered from their over-plucking in the 90s,” revealed Jenni Parks, 42, from London. “They grew back oddly shaped and uneven. I tried microblading (similar to a semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo) which was expensive and by the far the most painful cosmetic treatment I have ever had, only for the pigmentation to turn pink. I finally found a solution with permanent make up brows and for the first time ever I’m happy with them. So yes, I regret ever plucking them in the first place!”

A trend that’s waxed and waned

Eyebrow grooming is an extremely lucrative business: the eyebrow services industry in the US is currently estimated to be worth $180m.

But the shifting nature of eyebrow fashion is nothing new and can tell us a lot about the social and political backdrop of the era. “There is evidence as far back as ancient Greeks and Romans of particular eyebrow trends,” beauty historian Lucy Jane Santos told CNN. “They are cyclical and we’ll often see them swinging between extremes. In Ancient Greece and Rome it was thick dark eyebrows (that were favored) and even a monobrow was prized.”

Santos explains how, by contrast, sparse eyebrows were very popular in the Middle Ages: a trend that is evidenced in artworks from the time. Portraits of women from this period in history — Roger van der Weyden’s “Portrait of a Lady,” for instance, do not boast strong brow energy.

In those days women depilated not only the arches of their eyebrows but their hairlines as well, in a bid to create the look of an elongated forehead which was said to be a sign of intelligence.

“Women were plucking both their hairline and their eyebrows, partly to create the illusion of the elongated forehead,” she explained. “This was thought to be a sign of intelligence and beauty but it was also to make the face blank so as to draw attention to their decolletage.”

Santos explains that this practise was only among wealthy women rather than those who worked the fields: “Having the time to spend plucking your eyebrows denotes something about class and leisure time”.

During the 20th century the eyebrow trend cycle went much faster.

“In the 1920s (brows) were thin and plucked within an inch of their life,” said Santos. “Many historians believe this started with actresses in the silent film era when actresses relied on facial expressions and so a thin dark eyebrow was a strong, dramatic non-verbal communicator. Women were going to the cinema and seeing actresses with thin eyebrows and thick kohl liner and it (was) new, exciting and expressed modernity .”

But by the Second World War, women’s brows were thicker and less defined .

“There is a theory that during wartime ordinary women had more commitments and less time in general to spend on beauty,” Santos explained. “Why would you be spending time on frivolous things when you could be ‘digging for victory’? So, eyebrows were bigger and more natural during this time.”

Twiggy-style skinny brows dominated for the sixties and much of the seventies, but by the 1980s change was afoot once more: from Brooke Shields to Madonna, thick and slightly unruly brows were in vogue.

Men and their brows

Eyebrow grooming has traditionally pertained to women, certainly in the Europe and the West: in ancient Egypt men and women wore make up to accentuate their brows. Santos agrees that men’s eyebrows have not been subject to trends nearly as much as women’s, however she cites David Bowie shaving his off in 1974 and notes that this was not widely copied.

“[There] just seems to be not much of interest (in men’s eyebrow grooming) going on until eyebrow slits in the 80s,” she said.

Eyebrow slits — where a section of the eyebrow, usually towards the outer edge — is shaved out to form a clean, hairless, vertical line — are rooted in hip hop and gang culture. As such, slits are perceived as overtly masculine; a more socially “acceptable” way for men to groom their eyebrows than waxing, plucking and shaping.

Of course, like Bowie, there have been other men with notable brows such as Cristiano Ronaldo who is no stranger to facial topiary. But these men have been exceptions.

However there is plenty of evidence to suggest that eyebrow shaping and tidying is now becoming an important part of men’s grooming rituals, too.

“There tends to be two types of male clients who visit our UK salons,” explained Shavata Singh, founder of the Shavata Brow Studios, who counts Victoria Beckham, Elle Macpherson, Kate Hudson and Adele among her clients.

“Some men, whilst not following trends as such, prefer a more stylized, groomed-to-perfection brow with a high arch to maximise their eyes. Most however, want to retain an air of natural, rugged rather than ragged masculinity… Science has proven that a strong, full brow that gives the impression of natural masculinity, matched with the impression of a man who takes pride in his appearance, can be incredibly potent when attracting a mate”.

Of course, brands have responded with eyebrow grooming products geared specifically towards men: Chanel’s male makeup range Boy de Chanel offers a longwearing eyebrow pencil while Tom Ford for Men offers the Brow Definer, a gel which promises to tint and shape the natural brow.

Accentuating and working with what you already have seems like best way to go for everyone. But what if you’ve ruined what you were blessed with? What then?

If you’re looking to grow and thicken eyebrows, Kamini recommends applying castor oil “or any oil, at night,” over pricey growth serums, some of which can carry side effects. “Oil is good for stimulating eyebrow hair and it keeps them soft,” she added. “It’s magic.”

style,The creatives pushing nail art to sculptural new lengths,2024-08-19,Sandra Song,"When celebrity nail artist Juan Alvear first started doing nails in 2016, his deliberately “messy” and outlandish manicures would often extend through his clients’ hands and knuckles. There were large swatches of Barbie pink paint, abstract doodles rendered in glow-in-the-dark neons, and wiggly line work in deep blue polish that resembled a stormy sea.

Back then, Alvear was a student attending Cooper Union’s prestigious fine arts program in New York City, training to become a painter and sculptor. Like any good student, the majority of his time was spent inside a studio space he shared with six other classmates, painstakingly working on assignments.

At least until someone with a bottle of Sally Hansen from Duane Reade walked in, ready to be slathered with colors like “Beet It” or “O-Zone You Didn’t.”

“I wasn’t even doing those nails in a serious capacity,” Alvear told CNN with a laugh over a video call, describing those madcap manicures as “experiments” undertaken primarily for fun. And in return, he’d be able to keep leftover polish to use for his sketches and paintings — some of which were submitted as classwork — all while also creating content for his Instagram page, @byjuanalvear.

It was a win-win that satisfied both his oddball sense of whimsy and boundary-pushing art. Alvear’s designs are mind-bogglingly surreal, eye-catching and impressive; mixed-media creations that blend storybook fantasy, dystopian surrealism, and a distinctly Y2K aesthetic through gravity-defying shapes and the use of surprising materials, such as metal spikes, oversized gems, and glossy polishes.

Some of Alvear’s signature designs incorporate hyper-realistic versions of real-world oddities into a nail set — whether it be a Barbie head ice sculpture or a working hourglass — and turn an entire hand into a statement. Or as Alvear himself put it, a sort of “twisted fever dream” where everything “exists in excess for no reason.”

Soon enough, though, that social media side hustle had garnered Alvear a cult following, and acclaim that eclipsed his ‘traditional’ paint and sculpture works. Today, he is one the most sought-after manicurists in the industry, with his work regularly featured in luxury runway shows and on the hands of numerous A-listers like Lil Nas X, Rosalía, and Charli XCX, who’ve sported his nails on the red carpet, magazine spreads, and high-profile music videos.

Like most fashion trends and art movements, it’s hard to say when and where true nail sculpture began, although it’s safe to say that Black women pioneered statement acrylics after their invention in the 1950s. Superstars like Diana Ross and Donna Summer began wearing medium-length acrylics in the ‘70s; American track star Florence Griffith-Joiner becoming a style icon after famously breaking two world records at the 1988 Olympics, all while sporting a six-inch set of red, white, and blue acrylics. Throughout the ‘90s and aughts, statement nails continued to be a beauty staple for Black women, dominating hip-hop culture thanks to rappers like Missy Elliot and Lil Kim.

However, according to Isis Darks, curator of “ACRYLICS: Hidden Sculptural Art” a New York-based exhibition (now closed) and accompanying photobook, the more offbeat sculptural sets seemingly emerged around the early aughts in Tokyo’s fashionable Shibuya District. In the years since, they’ve laid the “foundation for some of the leading 3D creations,” with pioneering nail artist, Mei Kawajiri, being one of the first to open a “Shibuya style” nail salon in the city during the mid-aughts, where she made 3D sculpture of sweets, strawberries, eggplants and other playful subject matter — much of which was influenced her own love of “tiny miniature stuff.”

Now based in New York, Kawajiri continues to create sculptures inspired by ordinary, everyday objects — pasta, snails, toys and remote controls. Like Alvear, Kawajiri has accrued a large online following, which has landed her editorial gigs, couture fashion campaigns, and a large roster of celebrity clients like Emily Ratajkowski, Jonathan Van Ness, and even Kim Kardashian, who Kawajiri claimed once requested some “pierced toenails.”

For the most part though, she prefers more “practical” designs that allow her clients to go about their days relatively unimpeded, while Alvear creates ostentatious sculptural creations that aren’t at all suitable for everyday wear.

Despite their inconvenience, Kawajiri told CNN that she saw Alvear-inspired designs popping up all over TikTok and Instagram during Covid-19 lockdowns, when people began doing their own experimental manis at home and long nails were less of an issue. In fact, Kawajiri credits Alvear as the artist who made sculptural nail art “go viral” during this time, supporting Darks’ theory about the pandemic’s impact on social media subcultures (and culture at-large) causing “a major shift in the contribution to nail art, conversation, and the growth of the community.”

As a result, interest in sculptural nails has skyrocketed, with over 34.4 million TikToks hashtagged “#3DNailArt,” celebrities making headlines with their surrealist nails, and the discovery of new artists like Morgan Gilbertson, who went viral last year for her intricate tea set nails.

For Alvear though, the acclaim still feels a little odd.

“I’m thinking that it’s just this weird thing that I kind of stumbled into,” Alvear continued, noting that he’d long been conditioned by more traditional expectations of what constitutes ‘art’. Beauty has long been “correlated with self-care and maintenance,” Darks explained, rather than as an interpretation of the body as a canvas. With its primary presentation being on a “human subject,” there’s a “lack of acknowledgement for hairstylists, make-up artists, and nail artists in ‘white cube’ spaces.”

One could argue that nails are the least appreciated among the three, as hairstyling has already been the focus of shows at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Meanwhile, makeup artistry has also appeared inside the white cube via in-depth exhibitions examining the link between makeup and politics, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s multiple collaborations with the likes of Pat McGrath Labs, Le Labo, and Estée Lauder on limited-edition beauty products inspired by temporary exhibitions and the institution’s permanent collection. In comparison, nail art displays are often held at independent galleries — DegreeArt.com’s modest show in 2011 or the CND-sponsored exhibit at the Oceanside Museum of Art in 2019 — both of which were focused on painted sets, rather than sculptural pieces.

But, some believe this is changing. Recent exhibitions like “ACRYLICS” have sought to put the practise on a pedestal — or a gallery plinth, rather. Alvear has exhibited work including several standalone fingernail sculptures in a solo show at the Treize Gallery in Paris, which was said to deftly combine the “often separate realms of fine art, design and (the) beauty industry.”

“I think the shift is this public acknowledgment and participation in understanding that nail artists aren’t simply doing something ‘low-brow,’” Darks said, noting that “these artists are recreating Basquiat, Van Gogh, and realism portraits” on tiny surfaces.

“(It’s) opening the doors and conversations for galleries and curators in the art industry to consider multimedia concepts from these beauty-led mediums,” she said — a sentiment echoed by both Alvear and Kawajiri. The only real difference, after all, is the substitution of a tube of traditional acrylic paint for a little pot of acrylic sculpting gel."

“I think the shift is this public acknowledgment and participation in understanding that nail artists aren’t simply doing something ‘low-brow,’” Darks said, noting that “these artists are recreating Basquiat, Van Gogh, and realism portraits” on tiny surfaces.

“(It’s) opening the doors and conversations for galleries and curators in the art industry to consider multimedia concepts from these beauty-led mediums,” she said — a sentiment echoed by both Alvear and Kawajiri. The only real difference, after all, is the substitution of a tube of traditional acrylic paint for a little pot of acrylic sculpting gel."

CNN —

When former “facialist to the stars” Dawn DaLuise received a sudden stream of text messages in late June, it triggered memories of the months-long stalking campaign that derailed her beauty career and landed her in jail charged with soliciting murder.

A decade earlier, the messages might have contained threats from unknown senders, or responses to fliers offering “free” sex that had been printed with her contact details (alongside images of her and her daughters’ faces superimposed onto X-rated photos) and distributed on Santa Monica Boulevard.

As it happened, however, the texts were from friends and clients informing DaLuise of the latest chapter in a life story that came to resemble a Hollywood thriller: She was being portrayed by Elizabeth Banks in a new movie.

Hitting theaters today, “Skincare” tells the semi-fictional story of LA esthetician Hope Goodman (Banks), who becomes convinced that rival salon owner Angel Vergara (Luis Gerardo Méndez) is out to ruin her. Her tires are slashed, she receives creepy videos and nighttime phone calls, and a man shows up at her clinic after a classified ad invites strangers to fulfill her workplace rape fantasies.

“My phone was a receptacle for all sorts of harassment… during my ordeal, so when (all these messages) popped up, and the first thing I see is a trailer about my life, it caused me to revisit a bit of that trauma,” DaLuise told CNN in a video interview ahead of the movie’s release.

“Reputation is everything in this business,” Goodman observes in the movie, and hers is left in tatters by an explicit sexual email sent to her entire contact book from her account. Once-loyal customers flock over the street to Vergara’s booming salon, while an increasingly hysterical Goodman buys a gun for self-defense and follows her rival to his home. A friend’s offer of protection then takes a dramatic turn — as does her suspicion of who is really behind the harassment.

Art imitates life

Described in the movie’s opening credits as being “fictional” but “inspired by true events,” the story shares significant similarities with DaLuise’s.

Now 65, the esthetician once counted Jennifer Aniston and Sarah Michelle Gellar among the clients at her Hollywood clinic, Skin Refinery. Best-known for “galvanic” facials, which use small electrical currents to help beauty products penetrate the skin, DaLuise — much like the character Goodman — launched a skincare range and developed a media profile of her own.

In addition to the aforementioned fliers and texts, DaLuise’s tires were also slashed. She received hundreds of unwanted calls and multiple Craigslist ads were posted in her name claiming she was seeking a man to satisfy her sexual fantasies.

She, too, came to (erroneously) believe that an esthetician who opened a clinic next to hers, Gabriel Suarez, was behind the unsettling incidents.

“I was stunned and in awe of how precise everything (was), from the location (to) the mannerisms and the way in which our salons were both decked out,” DaLuise said of the production. “Somebody really did their homework and did it well.” (Banks, meanwhile, told Entertainment Weekly last month that she didn’t know the movie was inspired by a true story until “way later into the process.”)

But the movie’s plot subsequently deviates from reality in crucial ways — particularly when it comes to the crime DaLuise was accused of committing.

In March 2014, DaLuise was arrested and accused of a murder-for-hire plot against Suarez. The case centered on a text she sent to then-friend, Edward Feinstein, saying she had “found someone who is going to take Gabriel out.” DaLuise argued that the message had not been serious (she described it to CNN as “venting”).

The man she was accused of approaching about the hit, former NFL player Chris Geile, testified in court that he barely knew DaLuise and she had never asked him to kill Suarez. The jury took less than an hour to acquit her — but not before she spent 10 months in prison awaiting trial, during which time she developed colorectal cancer. (She later sued the LA Sheriff’s Department for wrongful imprisonment, among other things, and settled with the county for failing to diagnose her cancer while in custody.)

DaLuise believed she had been framed, and attention soon turned to the police’s informant, Feinstein. Authorities suspected that he and his friend (and one of DaLuise’s clients) Nick Prugo, a member of the infamous “Bling Ring” thieving gang that had targeted high-profile celebrities’ homes, were behind the nefarious acts, not Suarez.

In 2016, Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced Feinstein and Prugo to 350 hours of community service and three years of probation each on stalking misdemeanor charges. The pair were ordered to stay away from DaLuise and her two daughters, and to cease contact with one another for 10 years.

Feinstein and Prugo were also accused of posting an online ad soliciting men to visit DaLuise’s home to rape her, though the judge dismissed that felony charge, saying there was insufficient evidence.

The pair’s conviction followed a plea deal, and an alleged motive for their crimes was not published by the court. Offering her explanation in a 2015 episode of “Dr. Phil,” DaLuise said of Feinstein: “I just think it’s pathological, I think it’s sadistic and I think it’s psychotic.”

Setting the record straight

Despite DaLuise’s praise for the production, she is “disappointed” not to have been consulted by the writers or director, Austin Peters — or even invited to a preview screening (though she said she managed to “tag along” with other invitees to see the movie twice ahead of the release). Having explored the possibility of taking legal action against the studio, IFC Films, the still-practicing esthetician said she is now of a “if you can’t beat them, join them” mindset.

“I have no choice but to accept it, because the various attorneys who were vested in trying to assist me said there’s no real legal foundation for me claiming any kind of harm was done.”

“I feel like a mother figure wanting to shake my finger in (the writers’) faces and say, ‘You should have asked me for help, (the movie) would have been better than it is,’” she added.

IFC Films declined to comment on why it did not involve DaLuise in the project.

DaLuise hopes revived attention in her case will help her sell a documentary to a major network or streaming service, telling CNN she signed a “top director” for the project within days of the “Skincare” trailer’s release. (She has previously leaned into the controversy, making her 2018 comeback to the beauty industry using the brand name “Killer Facials”).

And while the various court proceedings have long concluded, details of the case continue to be debated online. Various social media accounts have been set up in DaLuise’s name claiming to expose the “truth” about her. Feinstein, who at the time reportedly told investigators that DaLuise was faking the harassment to discredit Suarez, continues to question the esthetician’s version of events, saying in a 2021 YouTube video he regrets taking a plea deal and claiming she fabricated stalking incidents.

DaLuise said she chose to remain “silent” over Feinstein’s claims, adding “I want him just to go away.” But seeing “Skincare” also left her wanting to set the record straight again, saying of the movie: “It was a bit of a rollercoaster ride, and it was enjoyable, but it wasn’t fact-based in any real way.”

“That movie was probably about 20% of my whole ordeal,” she added. “The audience has no idea about the follow up — the incarceration and whatnot. So, I’m a little bit more comfortable knowing that when my documentary comes out, people won’t even recognize it from the movie they saw. That’s my hope, because it’s so different.”"

style,Chidimma Adetshina: Miss South Africa finalist at center of nationality row to compete in Nigerian pageant instead,2024-08-16,Nimi Princewill,"Chidimma Adetshina, who quit the Miss South Africa beauty pageant last week after being embroiled in a row over her nationality, has accepted an invitation to compete for the title of Miss Universe Nigeria instead.

Born to a Nigerian father and a South African mother with Mozambican roots, Adetshina, 23, withdrew from the South African contest as questions swirled over her eligibility to enter and she became the target of xenophobic online attacks.

Posting on Instagram on August 8, she said she made the “difficult decision” to quit the contest to protect the “safety and wellbeing of my family and I.”

A day after Adetshina announced her withdrawal from the Miss South Africa pageant, the organizers of Miss Universe Nigeria invited her to compete in their contest instead, saying it was “an opportunity to represent her father’s native land on an international stage” and adding that her “journey in the world of pageantry is far from over.”

Responding to the invitation, Adetshina said in a video shared on Instagram Thursday that she was “excited to embark on this journey,” describing Miss Universe Nigeria as “Africa’s most prestigious beauty pageant.”

Under government investigation

When Adetshina was selected for the Miss South Africa pageant last month, her Nigerian names triggered calls for clarity on her citizenship status from some South Africans and made her the subject of xenophobic attacks on social media.

In a statement posted on its website on August 7, South Africa’s Home Affairs department, which oversees immigration, said it investigated Adetshina’s citizenship at the request of the pageant’s organizers and found that “fraud and identity theft may have been committed” by her mother to obtain South African citizenship.

However, it added that “Adetshina could not have participated in the alleged unlawful actions of her mother, as she was an infant at the time when the activities took place in 2001.”

The department said it was working to “establish the full set of facts” on the matter and was also “obtaining legal advice on the implications of the alleged fraudulent activity on Adetshina’s citizenship status.”

CNN has reached out to Adetshina for comment.

Miss South Africa’s organizers acknowledged Adetshina’s withdrawal from the contest, wishing her “the very best and success in all her endeavors.” They added in a statement that the pageant “celebrates South Africa’s rich and inclusive culture and diversity.”

The nationality spat has elicited mixed reactions in South Africa, where xenophobic and anti-immigrant attacks are common.

“If she (Adetshina) was born here, she is South African… she is not her parents,” populist opposition politician Julius Malema said in a recent interview discouraging xenophobia.

Adetshina’s withdrawal from the Miss South Africa contest also drew sympathy from Grammy-winning singer Tyla, who said in a post on X that she was “disappointed” at the online harassment Adetshina had faced.

Tyla said that while she “will always stand with South Africa,” she believed that “regardless of the opinions, she (Adetshina) was bullied and that’s what I don’t stand for.”

If she wins Miss Universe Nigeria, Adetshina will represent the West African nation in the Miss Universe beauty pageant to be held in Mexico later this year."

style,US to South Korea: TikTok star undergoes 15 beauty treatments in just 3 days,2024-08-10,Steffi Cao,"At the beginning of the year, Yerim Lee landed in Seoul, South Korea with the intention of spending around a week there with her extended family — and undertaking a serious, fast-tracked regime of beauty treatments.

Lee said she got 15 services done in the span of three days during her trip, sharing the list in a TikTok video from her account, @taxinoodle, that now has over 1.2 million views.

It’s no secret that Seoul has become a global beauty capital in recent years, known for its focus on skincare and makeup, as well as its famous plastic surgery clinics. But non- or minimally- invasive procedures have also become a popular way to achieve a seemingly-flawless natural look, emphasizing delicate, hyper-feminine features, glowy skin and glossy hair.

“A lot of women will get these treatments done every few weeks (for) their nails or their hair,” said Lee, referencing the regular upkeep of salon manicures, body waxing and blowouts — some of which have flourished into billion-dollar industries in South Korea. “These procedures have been around for so long.”

As the goalposts for what is considered beautiful continue to shift, cosmetic injectables and the type of treatments she underwent are also increasingly routine, she added.

Lee, who was raised in South Korea until the age of 11 and is now based in New York City, began getting beauty treatments in the US. “Now that I’m in my mid-20s… I started getting a little Botox here and there, but I prefer to do it in Korea because the price is unbeatable,” she said. She flies back regularly to get small touch-ups, but had never gone back for this many in one go until this year.

“The price benefit — you can’t ignore that,” Lee said. “Getting a plane ticket to Korea to get Botox and filler done is honestly cheaper than getting it done here.”

While the added costs of a plane ticket and hotel stay may not be cheaper than getting a single appointment at home, the savings can rack up over multiple treatments. Botox for Lee’s forehead, jaw and eyebrows ran her about $70 in Seoul, for example. The same amount of Botox would ring in anywhere from $500 to $1,400 in New York City.

For some, there’s the benefit of being able to travel while also getting these cheaper treatments done; in the creator economy, there’s also value (think monetized videos) in sharing such journeys on social media. Influencers offer tips on the best treatments to book when you only have a few days in the country or film their “glow-up days,” beating a constant refrain of affordability and innovative technologies. “Did u even go to Korea if u didn’t get a facial,” one TikTok user captioned their glow-up vlog.

“It’s becoming more common, and kind of like a trend, to talk openly in Korea about what procedures you get and share tips,” Lee added. Due to South Korea’s strict advertising laws, clinics often rely on word of mouth, so Lee leaned on friends and family for recommendations. “Beauty scams are also really common,” she added. “So that can make it harder for people who are visiting or don’t speak the language.”

Lee is currently developing a website and database to provide tips and resources for people interested in traveling to South Korea for K-beauty treatments, in order to help non-Korean speakers.

Medical and beauty tourism is a major source of revenue for the country. Last year, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare announced it will ease immigration procedures for tourists coming to the country for medical purposes, including cosmetic surgeries, aiming to attract 700,000 medical tourists by 2027. Last month, the ministry announced that the number of tourists who visited South Korea for cosmetic procedures reached an all-time high of 605,768 in 2023 — a 144.2% increase from the previous year.

Don’t be led by low prices alone, do your research

This means that the available products and services are expanding — and can even be “overwhelming,” Lee noted, though the competition has helped push down prices. Lee’s procedures ran as low as $19. That said, consumers should be wary of very cheap treatments. Vendors are split broadly into two categories, she said: factory clinics and boutique clinics. “(At) factory clinics, you don’t see a doctor — you know exactly what you’re there for,” she explained. You can be in and out in 10 minutes… It’s for people who know what they’re doing, and these clinics are a lot cheaper.”

“For travelers or first-timers, I would avoid them,” she added. “You should be doing your research and you should sit down with a doctor who can tell you what you should be looking for.”

Lee said when she went to boutique clinics, however, she was able to speak with a medical professional ahead of each procedure, learning what exactly the injectable or laser or treatments would do to her body and getting a more in-depth walkthrough of what to expect for the procedure and healing process. Many boutique clinics, she noticed, also had better options for non-Korean speakers.

A K-beauty odyssey, for the social media age

Lee visited six different clinics, the majority located in Seoul’s Gangnam neighborhood, which has long been known for its wealthy residents and emphasis on beauty (and, of course, was the inspiration behind K-pop star Psy’s viral 2012 hit, “Gangnam Style”). “Every ad and billboard you see will be for a plastic surgery clinic or something like that,” Lee said of the area. The term “Gangnam unnie” (Gangnam sister) emerged years ago to describe bandaged patients — those who had more drastic procedures done — coming out of one of the district’s many plastic surgery clinics. It has since become a derogatory term, “like, you look fake and plastic,” Lee explained.

She started with an appointment to have her eyebrows microbladed ($225), before visiting a vision center to have her irises measured. (The service, offered to Lee for free, is done to help consumers purchase the right size of colored lenses.)

On her next stop, Lee was put under general anesthesia to undergo a series of treatments at a plastic surgery clinic. This was her most intensive visit, she said — figuring she may as well make the most of being put under. All of the procedures targeted her face: three kinds of collagen-promoting “skin booster” injectables, including Juvelook (one vial, $400), Juvelook Volume (two vials, $830) and Rejuran Healer (one vial, $330); Botox ($70) in her forehead, jaw, and between the eyebrows; CO2 lasers ($8) that zapped off moles on her face and neck; and 600 shots of Ultherapy ($1,275), an ultrasound treatment that is intended to stimulate collagen production and define features.

“Ultherapy is well known to be the most expensive and effective procedure, as well as the most painful one,” she said. “That’s what left me with the most bruising and swelling after. I know some people get it done without going under, and I always see videos of people crying. They give you a very fluffy plushie to hang onto.”

At a second plastic surgery clinic, Lee got a few more procedures focused on her body, including Botox in her trapezius muscle, known as Traptox ($300), to get that “Jennie (Kim) shoulder look,” Lee said, referencing the Blackpink star’s coveted angular shoulders. She was also given fat dissolving shots ($150) in her arms — a procedure often called lipolysis in the US — and a Body InMode treatment ($600), which uses heat and radio frequency to remodel tissue for a tightened look. She had a few more moles lasered off with CO2 ($11) to round out the day.

At a third clinic, Lee received an additional InMode treatment focused on her chin, as well as additional fat-dissolving shots — aiming to achieve the tapered V-line face shape that has become a K-beauty standard. These treatments would normally cost $30 and $34 respectively, but Lee was offered them for free in exchange for potentially covering the experience on TikTok.

“My bruising lasted a whole two weeks, and swelling didn’t go down for three weeks,” she said. “It’s hard to say what one thing had the biggest effect on my face, though, because I got them all done at once. But there’s definitely a difference.”

Lee always gets her hair dyed ($125) in South Korea because she prefers the pricing and service. On this trip, she received a personalized “stem cell scalp” treatment ($190), and on TikTok claimed that light therapy given as part of the service helped to improve blood circulation, while various other techniques were used to reduce scalp buildup. Several Seoul-based clinics have gone viral on TikTok for using AI and other high-tech accessories to examine scalp health and address hair issues.

Lessons learned

The total cost for all of her procedures came out to $4,578. While the entire experience might seem like a lot, which is partly why she was inspired to post about it, Lee said she was happy with her services. But she emphasized that her satisfaction was partly due to the amount of homework she did beforehand to figure out which clinics were reputable and best suited to her needs. “It’s easier if you speak Korean,” she admitted, as many of the deals she found were through word-of-mouth or Korean social media apps.

Those looking to undergo treatments — at home or abroad — should conduct thorough research and be aware of issues such as scams, product safety and a clinic’s practices and reputation.

In a follow-up video on TikTok, Lee listed five things she would have done differently during her trip to Seoul, such as allowing for more recovery time and better understanding procedures’ side effects (her skin “swelled so much” after skin boosters that she was scared she was having an allergic reaction). In hindsight, Lee said she should have gotten everything done by one doctor, who could then advise on the optimal order of procedures, rather than at various clinics. (She spread the procedures out across multiple clinics for her own research purposes).

Lee said she doesn’t judge people who undergo procedures to fit certain beauty standards. “I want to shine a light on this side of beauty,” she explained. “Even just scrolling through TikTok, so many fans of Korean stars will swear, ‘I know she didn’t get anything done like other people,’ but this area of non-plastic surgery treatments is just so common. It’s not a bad or good thing, it’s just so ingrained in the culture.”"
style,US to South Korea: TikTok star undergoes 15 beauty treatments in just 3 days,2024-08-10,Steffi Cao,"At the beginning of the year, Yerim Lee landed in Seoul, South Korea with the intention of spending around a week there with her extended family — and undertaking a serious, fast-tracked regime of beauty treatments.

Lee said she got 15 services done in the span of three days during her trip, sharing the list in a TikTok video from her account, @taxinoodle, that now has over 1.2 million views.

It’s no secret that Seoul has become a global beauty capital in recent years, known for its focus on skincare and makeup, as well as its famous plastic surgery clinics. But non- or minimally- invasive procedures have also become a popular way to achieve a seemingly-flawless natural look, emphasizing delicate, hyper-feminine features, glowy skin and glossy hair.

“A lot of women will get these treatments done every few weeks (for) their nails or their hair,” said Lee, referencing the regular upkeep of salon manicures, body waxing and blowouts — some of which have flourished into billion-dollar industries in South Korea. “These procedures have been around for so long.”

As the goalposts for what is considered beautiful continue to shift, cosmetic injectables and the type of treatments she underwent are also increasingly routine, she added.

Lee, who was raised in South Korea until the age of 11 and is now based in New York City, began getting beauty treatments in the US. “Now that I’m in my mid-20s… I started getting a little Botox here and there, but I prefer to do it in Korea because the price is unbeatable,” she said. She flies back regularly to get small touch-ups, but had never gone back for this many in one go until this year.

“The price benefit — you can’t ignore that,” Lee said. “Getting a plane ticket to Korea to get Botox and filler done is honestly cheaper than getting it done here.”

While the added costs of a plane ticket and hotel stay may not be cheaper than getting a single appointment at home, the savings can rack up over multiple treatments. Botox for Lee’s forehead, jaw and eyebrows ran her about $70 in Seoul, for example. The same amount of Botox would ring in anywhere from $500 to $1,400 in New York City.

For some, there’s the benefit of being able to travel while also getting these cheaper treatments done; in the creator economy, there’s also value (think monetized videos) in sharing such journeys on social media. Influencers offer tips on the best treatments to book when you only have a few days in the country or film their “glow-up days,” beating a constant refrain of affordability and innovative technologies. “Did u even go to Korea if u didn’t get a facial,” one TikTok user captioned their glow-up vlog.

“It’s becoming more common, and kind of like a trend, to talk openly in Korea about what procedures you get and share tips,” Lee added. Due to South Korea’s strict advertising laws, clinics often rely on word of mouth, so Lee leaned on friends and family for recommendations. “Beauty scams are also really common,” she added. “So that can make it harder for people who are visiting or don’t speak the language.”

Lee is currently developing a website and database to provide tips and resources for people interested in traveling to South Korea for K-beauty treatments, in order to help non-Korean speakers.

Medical and beauty tourism is a major source of revenue for the country. Last year, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare announced it will ease immigration procedures for tourists coming to the country for medical purposes, including cosmetic surgeries, aiming to attract 700,000 medical tourists by 2027. Last month, the ministry announced that the number of tourists who visited South Korea for cosmetic procedures reached an all-time high of 605,768 in 2023 — a 144.2% increase from the previous year.

Don’t be led by low prices alone, do your research

This means that the available products and services are expanding — and can even be “overwhelming,” Lee noted, though the competition has helped push down prices. Lee’s procedures ran as low as $19. That said, consumers should be wary of very cheap treatments. Vendors are split broadly into two categories, she said: factory clinics and boutique clinics. “(At) factory clinics, you don’t see a doctor — you know exactly what you’re there for,” she explained. You can be in and out in 10 minutes… It’s for people who know what they’re doing, and these clinics are a lot cheaper.”

“For travelers or first-timers, I would avoid them,” she added. “You should be doing your research and you should sit down with a doctor who can tell you what you should be looking for.”

Lee said when she went to boutique clinics, however, she was able to speak with a medical professional ahead of each procedure, learning what exactly the injectable or laser or treatments would do to her body and getting a more in-depth walkthrough of what to expect for the procedure and healing process. Many boutique clinics, she noticed, also had better options for non-Korean speakers.

A K-beauty odyssey, for the social media age

Lee visited six different clinics, the majority located in Seoul’s Gangnam neighborhood, which has long been known for its wealthy residents and emphasis on beauty (and, of course, was the inspiration behind K-pop star Psy’s viral 2012 hit, “Gangnam Style”). “Every ad and billboard you see will be for a plastic surgery clinic or something like that,” Lee said of the area. The term “Gangnam unnie” (Gangnam sister) emerged years ago to describe bandaged patients — those who had more drastic procedures done — coming out of one of the district’s many plastic surgery clinics. It has since become a derogatory term, “like, you look fake and plastic,” Lee explained.

She started with an appointment to have her eyebrows microbladed ($225), before visiting a vision center to have her irises measured. (The service, offered to Lee for free, is done to help consumers purchase the right size of colored lenses.)

On her next stop, Lee was put under general anesthesia to undergo a series of treatments at a plastic surgery clinic. This was her most intensive visit, she said — figuring she may as well make the most of being put under. All of the procedures targeted her face: three kinds of collagen-promoting “skin booster” injectables, including Juvelook (one vial, $400), Juvelook Volume (two vials, $830) and Rejuran Healer (one vial, $330); Botox ($70) in her forehead, jaw, and between the eyebrows; CO2 lasers ($8) that zapped off moles on her face and neck; and 600 shots of Ultherapy ($1,275), an ultrasound treatment that is intended to stimulate collagen production and define features.

“Ultherapy is well known to be the most expensive and effective procedure, as well as the most painful one,” she said. “That’s what left me with the most bruising and swelling after. I know some people get it done without going under, and I always see videos of people crying. They give you a very fluffy plushie to hang onto.”

At a second plastic surgery clinic, Lee got a few more procedures focused on her body, including Botox in her trapezius muscle, known as Traptox ($300), to get that “Jennie (Kim) shoulder look,” Lee said, referencing the Blackpink star’s coveted angular shoulders. She was also given fat dissolving shots ($150) in her arms — a procedure often called lipolysis in the US — and a Body InMode treatment ($600), which uses heat and radio frequency to remodel tissue for a tightened look. She had a few more moles lasered off with CO2 ($11) to round out the day.

At a third clinic, Lee received an additional InMode treatment focused on her chin, as well as additional fat-dissolving shots — aiming to achieve the tapered V-line face shape that has become a K-beauty standard. These treatments would normally cost $30 and $34 respectively, but Lee was offered them for free in exchange for potentially covering the experience on TikTok.

“My bruising lasted a whole two weeks, and swelling didn’t go down for three weeks,” she said. “It’s hard to say what one thing had the biggest effect on my face, though, because I got them all done at once. But there’s definitely a difference.”

Lee always gets her hair dyed ($125) in South Korea because she prefers the pricing and service. On this trip, she received a personalized “stem cell scalp” treatment ($190), and on TikTok claimed that light therapy given as part of the service helped to improve blood circulation, while various other techniques were used to reduce scalp buildup. Several Seoul-based clinics have gone viral on TikTok for using AI and other high-tech accessories to examine scalp health and address hair issues.

Lessons learned

The total cost for all of her procedures came out to $4,578. While the entire experience might seem like a lot, which is partly why she was inspired to post about it, Lee said she was happy with her services. But she emphasized that her satisfaction was partly due to the amount of homework she did beforehand to figure out which clinics were reputable and best suited to her needs. “It’s easier if you speak Korean,” she admitted, as many of the deals she found were through word-of-mouth or Korean social media apps.

Those looking to undergo treatments — at home or abroad — should conduct thorough research and be aware of issues such as scams, product safety and a clinic’s practices and reputation.

style,"Miss USA: Alma Cooper of Michigan crowned, capping tumultuous year of pageant controversy",2024-08-04,Oscar Holland,"Michigan’s Alma Cooper, a US Army officer, was named Miss USA on Sunday, becoming the third person to hold the title this year following the shock resignation of 2023’s winner.

The 22-year-old, who has a Master’s in data science from Stanford University, beat 50 other contestants in a pageant that included swimwear and evening gown competitions. Kentucky’s Connor Perry and Oklahoma’s Danika Christopherson were named first and second runners up, respectively. Cooper is a second lieutenant who serves as a military intelligence officer, according to her social media.

“As the daughter of a migrant worker, a proud Afro Latina woman and an officer of the United States Army, I am living the American dream,” she had told judges during a Q&A session at Sunday’s finale. “If there’s anything that my life and my mother have taught me, it’s that your circumstances never define your destiny: You can make success accessible through demanding excellence.”

Cooper was crowned on stage by previous titleholder, Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, who inherited the tiara in May after Utah’s Noelia Voigt stepped down in highly controversial circumstances.

The glitzy televised event capped three months of turbulence for pageant organizers sparked by Voigt’s surprise resignation — and that of then-reigning Miss Teen USA, New Jersey’s UmaSofia Srivastava, just days later. The show featured no explicit references to the controversy, though Gankiewicz described her unexpected three-month stint as Miss USA as “the most unique reign in history.”

Announcing her decision via Instagram in May, Voigt attributed her resignation to mental health reasons. But social media users quickly spotted that the first letter of the first 11 sentences of her cryptic post spelled “I am silenced,” sparking rumors of a strict non-disclosure agreement.

Her resignation letter, later obtained by CNN, alleged delays in receiving prizes and a “toxic work environment” that “at best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.” Voigt also claimed to have been sexually harassed during a public appearance due the Miss USA organization’s failure to provide an “effective handler.”

Srivastava, who won the Miss Teen USA competition (a companion event, under the same ownership, for contestants aged 14 to 19), meanwhile attributed her resignation to a clash in “personal values” with the Miss USA organization. Both women’s mothers then appeared on Good Morning America, with Srivastava’s mother, Barbara, saying the beauty queens had been “ill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,” and that “the job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare.”

Organizers and the pageants’ parent company, the Miss Universe Organization, did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment at the time of the double resignation. Miss USA president Laylah Rose released a statement at the end of May, reported by the Los Angeles Times, refuting Voigt’s allegations.

New rules, groundbreaking firsts

The evening’s proceedings began with an elimination, as the 51 contestants were narrowed down to a top 20 based on judges’ scores from Saturday’s preliminary competition. The results of a swimwear competition saw the field reduced to 10 ahead of an eveningwear parade.

The final five were then asked the same question: “How can we bridge the gap between different cultures and foster understanding and respect?”

The televised finale, which was hosted by Garcelle Beauvais from “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and E! News presenter Keltie Knight, saw the contest return to California for the first time since 2007.

Judges included shoe designer Jojo Bragais and former Miss USA titleholders Carole Gist and Lu Parker.

Sunday marked the first Miss USA pageant to take place since its owner, the Miss Universe Organization, lifted a longstanding age restriction banning women over 28 from participating. Several finalists benefited from the new rule, including 41-year-old Kristina Johnson of Arizona and contestants from Montana, North Dakota, Maryland and Indiana, who are all in their 30s.

In other firsts, Maryland’s Bailey Anne Kennedy became the first transgender contestant from her state to appear at the finals, and Shavana Clarke of Connecticut arrived as the “first openly lesbian Miss USA state titleholder,” according to organizers.

Sunday’s finale comes three days after Addie Carver of Mississippi was named Miss Teen USA, a title that had remained vacant since Srivastava’s resignation (last year’s first runner-up, Stephanie Skinner, declined to take on the title). Seventeen-year-old Carver is a dance teacher, cheerleader and choreographer who has used her platform to discuss young people’s mental health, telling judges of her own struggles following her father’s death. “As the next Miss Teen USA I want to make it my mission to know that every little girl who is just like me once is never alone,” she said on stage Thursday evening.

Mental health struggles

Open to applicants aged 14 to 19, the annual Miss Teen USA contest celebrates “beauty, brains and confidence,” according to its official website. The preliminary contest on Wednesday evening saw all 51 participants take part in evening gown and activewear rounds (the latter replaced the controversial swimsuit category in 2016).

Thursday’s final, hosted by Rachel Lindsay of “The Bachelorette” and Justin Sylvester of E! News, began with the announcement of the top 20, who then participated in another activewear parade.

After being narrowed down to 10, finalists paraded in gowns before the final five answered an interview question in front of the judges, who included actress Francia Raisa and Rylee Arnold from “Dancing with the Stars.”

Asked about the biggest challenge facing young people today, Carver highlighted the importance of mental health. She described the impact that losing her father to lung cancer had on her, then aged 13, adding: “my mental health struggled severely but I was able to find hope again — and that was through the art of dance.”

style,Rare copy of US Constitution heads to auction in North Carolina,2024-09-09,Associated Press,"Asheville, N.C. AP —

Historical document appraiser and collector Seth Kaller spreads a broad sheet of paper across a desk. It’s in good enough condition that he can handle it, carefully, with clean, bare hands. There are just a few creases and tiny discolorations, even though it’s just a few weeks shy of 237 years old and has spent who knows how long inside a filing cabinet in North Carolina.

At the top of the first page are familiar words but in regular type instead of the sweeping Gothic script we’re used to seeing: “WE, the People …”

And the people will get a chance to bid for this copy of the US Constitution — the only of its type thought to be in private hands — at a sale by Brunk Auctions on Sept. 28 in Asheville, North Carolina.

The minimum bid for the auction of $1 million has already been made. There is no minimum price that must be reached.

This copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the proposed framework of the nation’s government in 1787 and sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government under the Articles of Confederation, requesting they send it to the states to be ratified by the people.

It’s one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the other seven are publicly owned.

Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states, essentially certifying them. They were sent to special ratifying conventions, where representatives, all white and male, wrangled for months before accepting the structure of the United States government that continues today.

“This is the point of connection between the government and the people. The Preamble — ‘we the people’ — this is the moment the government is asking the people to empower them,” auctioneer Andrew Brunk said.

What happened to the document up for auction between Thomson’s signature and 2022 isn’t known.

Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and he oversaw the state convention during his last year in office that ratified the Constitution.

The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old chairs and a dusty book case, before the old Johnston house was preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time like a book.

The document was found inside this filing cabinet in Edenton, North Carolina. AP

“I get calls every week from people who think they have a Declaration of Independence or a Gettysburg Address and most of the time it is just a replica, but every so often something important gets found,” said Kaller, who appraises, buys and sells historic documents.

“This is a whole other level of importance,” he added.

Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet printed front and back is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He acknowledged there will have to be compromise and that rights the states enjoyed will have to be given up for the nation’s long-term health.

Brunk isn’t sure what the document might go for because there is so little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution like this sold was for $400 in 1891.

But that document was meant to be distributed to the Founding Fathers as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. The signed copy being sold later this month was one meant to be sent to leaders in every state so people all around the country could review and decide if that’s how they wanted to be governed, connecting the writers of the Constitution to the people in the states who would provide its power and legitimacy.

style,Rare copy of US Constitution heads to auction in North Carolina,2024-09-09,Associated Press,"Asheville, N.C. AP —

Historical document appraiser and collector Seth Kaller spreads a broad sheet of paper across a desk. It’s in good enough condition that he can handle it, carefully, with clean, bare hands. There are just a few creases and tiny discolorations, even though it’s just a few weeks shy of 237 years old and has spent who knows how long inside a filing cabinet in North Carolina.

At the top of the first page are familiar words but in regular type instead of the sweeping Gothic script we’re used to seeing: “WE, the People …”

And the people will get a chance to bid for this copy of the US Constitution — the only of its type thought to be in private hands — at a sale by Brunk Auctions on Sept. 28 in Asheville, North Carolina.

The minimum bid for the auction of $1 million has already been made. There is no minimum price that must be reached.

This copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the proposed framework of the nation’s government in 1787 and sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government under the Articles of Confederation, requesting they send it to the states to be ratified by the people.

It’s one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the other seven are publicly owned.

Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states, essentially certifying them. They were sent to special ratifying conventions, where representatives, all white and male, wrangled for months before accepting the structure of the United States government that continues today.

“This is the point of connection between the government and the people. The Preamble — ‘we the people’ — this is the moment the government is asking the people to empower them,” auctioneer Andrew Brunk said.

What happened to the document up for auction between Thomson’s signature and 2022 isn’t known.

Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and he oversaw the state convention during his last year in office that ratified the Constitution.

The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old chairs and a dusty book case, before the old Johnston house was preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time like a book.

“I get calls every week from people who think they have a Declaration of Independence or a Gettysburg Address and most of the time it is just a replica, but every so often something important gets found,” said Kaller, who appraises, buys and sells historic documents.

“This is a whole other level of importance,” he added.

Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet printed front and back is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He acknowledged there will have to be compromise and that rights the states enjoyed will have to be given up for the nation’s long-term health.

“To secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each and yet provide for the interest and safety for all — individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest,” wrote the man who would become the first US president.

Brunk isn’t sure what the document might go for because there is so little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution like this sold was for $400 in 1891.

style,Denmark: L.E. Bruun’s expensive coin collection going up for sale,2024-08-26,Jacqui Palumbo,"Following the death of the Danish butter magnate Lars Emil Bruun in 1923, his will had a curious order: His vast accumulation of coins, notes and medals, amassed over more than six decades, should be held as an emergency reserve for Denmark’s national collection in case it were ever destroyed. After a century, if all was well, his own cache could finally be sold to benefit his descendants.

Next month, just under a year since the 100-year-old order expired, the first set of coins from Bruun’s personal 20,000-piece collection will go up for auction. It will take several sales to empty Bruun’s coffers, but once completed, it will be the most expensive international coin collection ever sold, according to Stack’s Bowers, the rare coin dealer and auction house hosting the sales. The L.E. Bruun Collection has been insured for 500 million Danish kroner, or around $72.5 million. The auction house describes it as the most valuable collection of world coins to ever come to market.

Where the numismatist’s collection has resided over the past century had been something of a mystery, its location known to few. But Bruun believed that hiding his treasure was for a noble cause; following the destruction he saw of World War I, he feared the Royal Danish Coin and Medal Collection could one day face bombing or looting, according to the auction house.

Bruun began collecting currency as a child in 1859, when his uncle died and named him among the recipients of some of his coins, according to the sales catalog. The son of innkeepers and landowners, he learned in his 20s that his family inheritance had been squandered and he was saddled in debt. He began his own business in butter with a loan, eventually earning a fortune from sales and exports. With his wealth, he became a prolific coin collector, and was a founding member of the Danish Numismatic Society in 1885.

“The good thing about collecting coins is that when you are upset about something or you feel unsettled, then you go and look at your coins, and then you calm down by studying them again and again pondering the many unsolved problems they present,” he once told a Danish magazine, per the catalog. “People who are exclusively devoted to their business make a great mistake. I, for one, could never imagine thinking about nothing but butter until my dying days.”

For the first sale on September 14, Stack’s Bowers will offer up more than 280 lots that include gold and silver coins from Denmark, Norway and Sweden, dated from the late 15th century to the latter years of Bruun’s life. They are valued at over $10 million. The star lot is one of Scandinavia’s oldest gold coins, according to the catalog, a noble of King Hans dated from 1496, which could sell for up to €600,000 euro, or $672,510. All in, the high estimate for the first round is just over €13 million, or $14.6 million, according to Stack’s Bowers.

“Hands-down my favorite piece in the sale is the 1496 gold noble of King Hans, who was king of Denmark and Norway under the Kalmar Union, as well as Sweden for a brief time. It is important on so many levels — it’s the very first gold coin struck by Denmark, it’s the very first dated coin struck by the Danish kingdom, and it’s unique in private hands,” said Matt Orsini, director of world and ancient numismatics at Stack’s Bowers Galleries, in a press statement.

Over the past few months, the coins toured different fairs and exhibited at Stack’s Bowers’ galleries. They will be on display in Copenhagen just before the sale."

style,Babe Ruth’s “Called Shot” jersey sells for record $24 million,2024-08-15,Lauren Rapp,"Editor’s Note: This article has been updated with sale details and results following Sunday’s auction.

The jersey that legendary New York Yankees player Babe Ruth wore when he hit one of baseball’s most famous home runs sold for $24.12 million on Sunday — making it the world’s most valuable sports collectible.

Dallas-based Heritage Auctions said the jersey achieved the record — previously held by a 1952 Mickey Mantle baseball card that fetched $12.6 million in August 2022 — after a “thrilling bidding war” that lasted over six hours.

Ruth was wearing the road gray No. 3 jersey when he played against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series. He appeared to gesture toward something in center field just before hitting a fifth-inning home run into the bleachers. Over the last 92 years, the “Called Shot” has become infamous in baseball lore, being “endlessly celebrated, imitated and replicated,” the auction house said in a press release. However, where Ruth was actually pointing — at something deep in the field, like the flagpole, or at the Cubs pitcher — has been contested over the years.

“The ‘Called Shot’ is something we’re still talking about almost 100 years later, which is incredible,” said Chris Ivy, director of Heritage’s sports auctions, in a call with CNN prior to the sale. “And we’re discussing it because of the controversy, because of the mystery.”

“Did Ruth really call the shot?” he added. “We know he points because there’s some grainy footage from someone out in the stands, but from that footage, you can’t see which direction he’s pointing.”

Baseball games would not be televised until 1939, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, leaving journalists to be the first to report what happened that day. According to Heritage Auctions, sports editor Joe Williams is credited with the first headline that reported Ruth called the shot, likening it to a billiards game, and Ruth quickly embraced the story.

The auction, held over the weekend, showcased other historic sports memorabilia including one of Michael Jordan’s “Last Dance” Chicago Bulls jerseys and a signed and game-used bat from baseball great Jackie Robinson.

Another “Last Dance” jersey, which Jordan wore during the 1998 NBA Finals, sold for a record $10.1 million in 2022, making it the most expensive basketball jersey to sell at auction, CNN previously reported.

Opening bids for Ruth’s “Called Shot” jersey had already surpassed $14 million, almost a week before it became available at auction. Heritage Auctions estimated it could go for as high as $30 million.

The iconic Yankees garb has been authenticated twice, according to the auction house, and can be photo-matched to two pictures from Getty Images and a third from The Chicago Daily News showing Ruth, teammate Lou Gehrig and manager Joe McCarthy in the dugout.

Ivy described the “Called Shot” jersey “the most significant piece of American sports memorabilia ever offered at auction,” in a press statement.

Ruth’s famed baseball career spanned 22 seasons and included 714 home runs and seven World Series titles. While the pitcher and outfielder is best known for his time with the New York Yankees, he won three of his World Series titles with the Boston Red Sox. In 1936, he became one of the five inaugural members elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 2019, a Babe Ruth jersey from 1928-1930 fetched $5.64 million at auction, making it the most expensive pieces of sports memorabilia ever sold at the time. It broke the previous record — another Ruth jersey — that went for $4.4 million."

style,"Botswana diamond: Huge 2,492-carat stone, believed to be world’s second-largest, found",2024-08-22,Lianne Kolirin,"A massive 2,492-carat rough diamond, believed to be the second biggest ever found, has been unearthed in Botswana, according to a mining company.

The huge stone is thought to be the biggest found since the 3,106-carat Cullinan Diamond was discovered in South Africa in 1905.

Canadian mining company Lucara Diamond Corp. announced Thursday that the “exceptional” gem was found intact in its Karowe mine.

Calling it a “remarkable” find, the company celebrated it as “one of the largest rough diamonds ever unearthed.”

It was detected, unearthed and recovered thanks to the company’s Mega Diamond Recovery (MDR) X-ray Transmission (XRT) technology, which is designed to “identify and preserve large, high-value diamonds,” the company said in a press release.

William Lamb, president and CEO of Lucara, said in the release: “We are ecstatic about the recovery of this extraordinary 2,492 carat diamond.”

Rough diamonds are usually classified as being gem-quality, near-gem or industrial-quality, depending on their color, clarity, size and shape.

Prior to the latest announcement, the second largest discovery was thought to be the Lesedi La Rona, a 1,109-carat stone also found by Lucara at the Karowe mine in 2015. The diamond was sold to luxury jeweler Graff for $53 million two years later.

Lucara’s spokeswoman said the company had found found six of the top 10 diamonds ever discovered.

The stone will be properly evaluated over the coming weeks, the spokeswoman added.

The diamond is due to be presented to Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Thursday, according to Reuters.

Last month, Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond producer by value, proposed a law to request that, once they are granted licenses, mining companies sell a 24% stake in mines to local investors unless the government exercises its option to acquire the shareholding, according to Reuters.

The record-breaking 3,106-carat Cullinan Diamond was found in 1905 at the Premier mine in Transvaal, now South Africa. It was subsequently cut into smaller stones, some of which form part of the British royal family’s crown jewels."

style,"Beyoncé launches SirDavis, a whiskey inspired by ‘moonshiner’ great-grandfather",2024-08-22,Oscar Holland,"“Bottle in my hand, the whiskey up high,” Beyoncé sang on her latest album “Cowboy Carter,” released earlier this year.

Now it seems she may have had a specific brand in mind.

On Tuesday, the 32-time Grammy-winner unveiled her latest business endeavor: A luxury whiskey inspired by her Prohibition-busting great-grandfather.

The brand is a joint venture between Beyoncé and Moët Hennessy, the drinks division of luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns dozens of wine, champagne and spirit labels including Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon.

Promising an “unexpected take” on American whiskey, the drink is named SirDavis in honor of the singer’s paternal great-grandfather Davis Hogue. A farmer and Prohibition-era “moonshiner,” Hogue stashed liquor bottles “in the empty knots of cedar trees for friends and kin to find and enjoy,” according to a press release.

“When I discovered that my great-grandfather had been a moonshine man, it felt like my love for whisky was fated,” Beyoncé said in a statement. “SirDavis is a way for me to pay homage to him, uniting us through a new shared legacy.”

SirDavis’ website features a handwritten letter from Beyoncé to Hogue saying his “legacy is a force that drives me.”

The recipe was masterminded by Bill Lumsden, the distiller behind LVMH-owned Scottish single-malt whiskies Glenmorangie and Ardbeg. With a mash featuring 51% rye and 49% malted barley, the whiskey’s maturation is completed in a sherry cask, the press release said.

The resulting flavor profile is described as evoking dark red fruits, clove and cinnamon, with an “elegant mouthfeel and texture reminiscent of Japanese and Scotch whiskies.”

LVMH said Beyoncé was involved in designing the bottle, which features a bronze horse logo representing the Houston-born star’s Texas roots.

Although described as “years in the making,” the move is in keeping with the singer’s recent “cowboycore” public image. The country-inspired “Cowboy Carter” and its predecessor “Renaissance” both featured images of the singer riding a horse, with lyrical references to whiskey appearing across the two records.

SirDavis is the latest venture in a business empire that, in the past 9 months alone, has expanded to include a fragrance (Cé Noir) and a line of haircare products (Cécred). The 42-year-old singer also operates Parkwood Entertainment, a production house that counts athleisure clothing line Ivy Park among its subsidiaries.

Beyoncé is the latest in a long list of celebrities entering the luxury drinks market in recent years — a list that includes Drake, Dwayne Johnson, George Clooney and her own husband Jay-Z, who sold a 50% stake in his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, to LVMH in 2021.

Moët Hennessy, meanwhile, will be hoping for a larger slice of the burgeoning $5.1-billion US whiskey market. Whiskey now accounts for 62% of all American spirits exports, while the number of distillers has jumped from 35 two decades ago to 2,600 in 2023.

style,How the lobster became an unlikely status symbol — and a ‘cultural icon’,2024-08-21,Jacqui Palumbo,"Despite its shiny red exoskeleton and reputation as a bug of the sea, the lobster — though far from the world’s strangest delicacy — has long reigned as an unlikely luxury staple. As well as a high-ticket menu item, the crustacean is also a longstanding symbol of opulence in art and fashion, reaching cultural status beyond other culinary indulgences like caviar or pricey cuts of steak.

On menus, the aquatic arthropod can reach sky-high prices: a blue lobster paella for $230 in Las Vegas, a lobster tower for nearly $700 in Toronto, or giant salted egg lobster for $460 in Vietnam. On high-fashion runways, Schiaparelli, Dior, Thom Browne and Maison Margiela have all paid tribute to its pinching claws and curved tail — and celebrities including Zendaya, Lady Gaga and Chloë Sevigny have all embraced the look. In art, lobsters have symbolized longevity in Edo-period Japanese prints, power in Flemish paintings and sex organs in the surrealist genre.

Lobsters inhabit oceans all around the world and are desired widely, with Asia’s appetite, in particular, surging its multibillion-dollar global market value, according to data analysis firm Markets and Research. On New England’s coasts, demand — and cost — for the crustacean has continued to grow as lobsters have drastically declined in New England’s warming waters in recent years, according to the non-profit local media outlet Maine Public.

But lobsters haven’t always been considered a status symbol. Across the Internet, they are often framed as a rags-to-riches story, with the factoid shared widely that they used to be grub for prisoners and enslaved persons in colonial America. And though it’s true that New England’s plentiful lobsters were little valued by British settlers, that hardly captures the full history of the sea creature, which has been eaten for at least 250 million years, as the author Elisabeth Townsend’s book “Lobster: A Global History” charts. From the large-clawed American species served on buns to the coveted spiny lobster in Japan; from the rock lobsters enjoyed in South Africa and Australia (and name-dropped by The B-52s), to langoustines — or prawns — exalted in French cooking, lobsters have a long and varied culinary history across the world.

“The world’s love affair with lobster began out of necessity,” Townsend writes. “Humans needed to eat and the crustacean was often within easy reach…. But the shellfish eventually became more than just grub — its status shifted from vital protein to cultural icon.”

From ‘survival fare’ to delicacy

In its earliest history, going back to the Stone Ages, lobster was considered “survival fare,” according to Townsend, for the same reasons it’s valuable today: lobster is difficult to gather and transport since it decays rapidly once killed. But lobsters were also revered at points in the ancient world, too, appearing both on a 15th-century BC Egyptian temple and an approximately 1st-century BC mosaic floor in Pompeii — the latter because Ancient Romans considered it a “treat,” Townsend explained. Similarly, lobster motifs on ceramics by Peru’s Moche culture, from between the 1st and 8th centuries, suggested its value within their coastal communities.

Across eras and regions, lobster was consumed in different ways. Its simplest preparations were boiled or smoked — or baked, as in coastal Native American communities long before New England became known for its seafood-filled clambakes. By the time Europe entered the Middle Ages, cookbooks were suggesting dishes such as spiced lobster soup, Townsend writes, though the ingredient was pricey due to transportation costs.

As maritime trade began reshaping the world, lobster became a key ingredient for aristocratic Europeans who served feasts stacked with exotic global ingredients to flex their wealth and power. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Flanders, where the port city of Antwerp became a center of colonial trade, art reflected the same desire to accumulate an impressive array of goods.

“There was a larger movement within still-life paintings from relatively modest scenes in Northern Europe to much more luxurious, elaborate ones,” said Christopher D.M. Atkins, the director of the Center for Netherlandish Art at MFA Boston, in a phone call with CNN. “Earlier, Dutch painters would depict relatively simple meals: herring, cheese a glass of beer.” As the region grew richer, though, so did its painted subjects. “You begin to see things with fruits and game, wine and elaborate glassware, imported porcelain and luxury goods.”

It’s then that lobsters begin to arrive — representing the “wealth of the sea”, Atkins explained. A 1565 painter Willem Kalf, for instance, shows a lobster arranged alongside a gleaming buffalo drinking horn, fine glassware and a decorative carpet.

Lobsters may have also been appealing to artists of the era as a bright splash of color on the canvas, he said, or for its contribution to sumptuous, contrasting textures — a smooth crustacean shell next to a peeled lemon rind or transparent glass, for instance — all in service of the illusionary power of the composition.

“It gave painters the opportunity to show off,” he said.

A scandalous symbol

But if Dutch art gave the lobster an important supporting role, the surrealist movement in the mid 20th-century offered it a chance to be a star, thanks in large part to a now-infamous dress born of creative partnership of Dalí and Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli.

Schiaparelli “felt connected to the movement because she had a lot of fantasy and whimsy (in her designs),” explained curator Marie-Sophie Carron de la Carrière, who organized a 2022 show of the couturier’s work at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.

By the 1930s, when the pair struck up a friendship, the lobster had already become a mainstay in fine dining. The golden age of French cooking — haute cuisine — had dreamt up elaborate ways of preparing the shellfish with truffles and champagne, while new-monied industrialists in New York enjoyed it at the city’s finest restaurants.

But now was time for the lobster’s entrance into haute couture as well. Dalí had already introduced the lobster as an erotic symbol in his 1936 surrealist object “Lobster Telephone,” and the following year, Schiaparelli offered him a new kind of blank canvas through an off-white high-waisted silk organza gown — one of several collaborations between the pair. Dalí’s print on the dress depicted a swooping lobster with parsley scattered around it. (His desire to add a flourish of mayonnaise is said to have been nixed by Schiaparelli.)

Carron de la Carrière, emphasized just how suggestive the now-iconic dress was. With the lobster featured twice, appearing to travel down the front of the dress and then up the back, “What was happening between?” she asked.

When twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson donned the dress in Vogue just days before marrying Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor — who had shocked Britain by abdicated his crown for their tumultuous union — it only added to the highly public scandal, the curator explained.

Since then, the lobster has become a touchstone in fashion and art history and is regularly resurfaced, from Anna Wintour wearing a take on it from Prada to the 2012 Met Gala to Zendaya sporting a referential skirt from Schiaparelli — under creative director Daniel Roseberry — last year. (Roseberry’s predecessor at the fashion house, Bertrand Guyon, had also re-envisioned the piece in a gown for the label’s Spring 2017 Haute Couture collection, to mark its 80th anniversary.) With the shellfish’s place cemented in both the culinary world and visual culture, it isn’t likely to fall out of favor soon as a signifier of status and style — though as the changing climate endangers its habitat, we should sincerely consider the lobster."
style,How the lobster became an unlikely status symbol — and a ‘cultural icon’,2024-08-21,Jacqui Palumbo,"Despite its shiny red exoskeleton and reputation as a bug of the sea, the lobster — though far from the world’s strangest delicacy — has long reigned as an unlikely luxury staple. As well as a high-ticket menu item, the crustacean is also a longstanding symbol of opulence in art and fashion, reaching cultural status beyond other culinary indulgences like caviar or pricey cuts of steak.

On menus, the aquatic arthropod can reach sky-high prices: a blue lobster paella for $230 in Las Vegas, a lobster tower for nearly $700 in Toronto, or giant salted egg lobster for $460 in Vietnam. On high-fashion runways, Schiaparelli, Dior, Thom Browne and Maison Margiela have all paid tribute to its pinching claws and curved tail — and celebrities including Zendaya, Lady Gaga and Chloë Sevigny have all embraced the look.

style,Steve McCurry’s photo of Shaolin monks training captures their incredible acrobatics,2024-05-03,Amy Gunia,"Editor’s Note: In Snap, we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made.

A young Shaolin monk runs horizontally across a wall, intense concentration, and perhaps a hint of astonishment, visible in his face. Four other trainees at a martial arts academy near the Shaolin Temple in China’s Henan province lounge nonchalantly, seemingly unaware of the gravity-defying action taking place above their heads. Their bright orange robes and Feiyue sneakers stand in contrast to the earthen wall behind them.

The blurred back of a man on the left side of the image highlights the sharp movement at its center. A monk stretching in the background demonstrates his dexterity in a split-like stance.

“There’s this high-level action,” photographer Steve McCurry told CNN of the photo’s composition in a video call from his home in Philadelphia. “And these other boys are just hanging out.”

The image was recently featured in Magnum’s Square Print Sale in May, alongside other photographers’ works. He shot it back in 2004, as part of a personal project, while traveling the world to document various forms of Buddhism. While he doesn’t consider himself to be Buddhist, McCurry has long been interested in the religion and applies some of its principles to his own life.

The Shaolin Temple – which was founded in AD 495 on the slopes of the sacred Mount Song – is said to be the home of Chan Buddhism. Although the religion emphasizes nonviolence, the temple’s warrior monks initially practiced martial arts to defend themselves from bandits. Over time, their rigorous physical training became inexorably linked with their quest to achieve enlightenment.

Today, Shaolin kung fu is widely known, and the monks’ feats in athleticism have been emulated in popular movies. The 1982 movie “The Shaolin Temple,” which launched Jet Li’s career and was filmed on location, was one of the films that brought renewed interest in the monastery. By the time McCurry visited in 2004, dozens of martial arts schools had sprung up on the road leading up to the temple.

“It’s incredible to watch them perform and train,” he said. “You can’t imagine that people can actually do that with their bodies.”

A career on the road

McCurry started his career working at a local newspaper after graduating from Pennsylvania State University. He then started traveling abroad as a freelance photographer, shooting images of people in some of the world’s most dangerous and remote places.

His career took off in earnest after he snuck across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan in 1979, right before the Soviet invasion. He smuggled film out by hiding it in his clothing, providing the world some of the first photos of the conflict that left at least 500,000 Afghans dead and millions displaced.

His 1984 “Afghan girl” photograph – which captured the piercing green eyes of a 12-year-old refugee in Peshawar, Pakistan and was featured on National Geographic magazine’s June 1985 cover – is one of the world’s most famous photos.

Over the course of his 50-year career, McCurry, now 74, has filled more than 20 passports, snapping animals and festivals, worshippers and fighters, conflicts and catastrophes in destinations from Niger to India. He captures the ancient against the modern, the curious amid the day-to-day and accentuates the familiarity of strangers.

In 2016, McCurry came under fire when one of his photos in an exhibition was discovered to be digitally altered. He said it had happened in his studio while he was out traveling, but more images that appeared to be manipulated began surfacing, igniting a debate around the ethics of photojournalism.

In response to the allegations, the photographer told Time magazine later that year that beyond the brief stint at the local newspaper in Pennsylvania, he had never been employed by a newspaper, news magazine or news outlet. As a freelancer, he had taken on various assignments, including advertising campaigns. He said his work had “migrated into the fine art field” and that he considered himself a “visual storyteller.”

He added that he understood it could be “confusing … for people who think I’m still a photojournalist,” and that going forward, he would only use Photoshop “in a minimal way, even for my own work taken on personal trips.”

‘Going back again and again’

Before shooting the photograph of the wall-running monk, McCurry had already paid a visit to the Shaolin Temple two decades earlier. He says it was “really empty” during that first trip, and he saw only “bicycles and people in these Mao suits.”

By the time he returned, a kung fu craze had gripped the nation. The area felt more commercial, he recalled. Tens of thousands of (mostly) Chinese boys and men were inspired by a wave of kung fu movies, and were training at the dozens of schools in the area.

The photographer was granted permission at one of the academies and spent a few days with the monks as they went about their daily routine, which included practicing acrobatics on repeat. Some of the boys ate with McCurry at a noodle joint across the street, sharing their hopes to eventually land jobs in security services, performance troupes, as well as the entertainment industry. “They were normal kids,” he said. “But they were very, very dedicated and serious about this practice.”

He captured other photographs of monks’ intense training regimes during his stay, including several hanging upside down by their feet, hands calmly pressed into a prayer pose.

McCurry sought to find the right combination of variables like the subject, angle, light, and background, as the monks perfected their moves. “It’s a (matter) of photographing and going back again and again.”

His perseverance paid off. “It’s a picture that evokes a lot of emotion,” he said of the final shot of the wall-running monk. “It either brings a smile to people’s faces, or they’re kind of in awe of the physicality of these young boys.”"

travel,National Park calls out ‘world changing’ impact of dropped Cheetos bag,2024-09-09,Marnie Hunter,"Plain water is the only thing visitors are allowed to consume inside the huge cavern at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. Cheetos are a no-go, and the recent park visitor who dropped a bag full of them created a “huge impact” on the cave’s ecosystem, the park said Friday in a Facebook post.

“At the scale of human perspective, a spilled snack bag may seem trivial, but to the life of the cave it can be world changing,” the park said in its post about the garbage found off-trail in the Big Room.

“The processed corn, softened by the humidity of the cave, formed the perfect environment to host microbial life and fungi. Cave crickets, mites, spiders and flies soon organize into a temporary food web, dispersing the nutrients to the surrounding cave and formations. Molds spread higher up the nearby surfaces, fruit, die and stink. And the cycle continues.”

The park said rangers spent 20 minutes carefully removing molds and foreign debris from surfaces inside the cave, noting that while some members of the ecosystem that rose from the snacks were cave-dwellers “many of the microbial life and molds are not.”

The post called that particular impact on the cave “completely avoidable,” contrasting it with the hard-to-prevent fine trails of lint left by each visitor.

“Great or small we all leave an impact wherever we go. Let us all leave the world a better place than we found it,” the post urged park goers.

The park’s website says that eating and drinking anything other than plain water attracts animals into the cavern.

Carlsbad Caverns followed up its post about the Cheetos bag with a post about the “leave no trace” principle of disposing of waste properly.

“Contrary to popular belief, the cave is NOT a big trash can,” the post said, yet rangers pick up waste left behind every day.

“Sometimes this can be a gum wrapper or a tissue, other times it can unfortunately mean human waste, spit, or chewing tobacco.” Visitors are asked to make sure they don’t leave trash in the cavern and to use designated restrooms.

The Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns National Park is the largest single cave chamber by volume in North America. It is accessible via a relatively flat 1.25 mile (2 km) trail. The cavern was formed millions of years ago when sulfuric acid dissolved limestone, creating cave passages."
travel,National Park calls out ‘world changing’ impact of dropped Cheetos bag,2024-09-09,Marnie Hunter,"Plain water is the only thing visitors are allowed to consume inside the huge cavern at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. Cheetos are a no-go, and the recent park visitor who dropped a bag full of them created a “huge impact” on the cave’s ecosystem, the park said Friday in a Facebook post.

“At the scale of human perspective, a spilled snack bag may seem trivial, but to the life of the cave it can be world changing,” the park said in its post about the garbage found off-trail in the Big Room.

“The processed corn, softened by the humidity of the cave, formed the perfect environment to host microbial life and fungi. Cave crickets, mites, spiders and flies soon organize into a temporary food web, dispersing the nutrients to the surrounding cave and formations. Molds spread higher up the nearby surfaces, fruit, die and stink. And the cycle continues.”

The park said rangers spent 20 minutes carefully removing molds and foreign debris from surfaces inside the cave, noting that while some members of the ecosystem that rose from the snacks were cave-dwellers “many of the microbial life and molds are not.”

travel,Haiku Stairs: 14 people arrested for illegal hiking in Hawaii,2024-09-09,Lilit Marcus,"Hawaii’s most controversial nature spot has once again become a center of concern, with 14 people recently arrested for accessing the Haiku Stairs on the island of Oahu according to officials.

They are beautiful but unexpected: 4,000 metal steps, built by the US Navy during World War II and abandoned not long after. Located in a remote area of Kaneohe, the only way to access the stairs is via a dangerous and unsanctioned hike.

“It’s incredibly disrespectful and self-centered for anyone to be on the Haiku Stairs, or on the Middle Ridge Trail, when it’s been made abundantly clear that these areas are off-limits for safety and natural resource protection reasons,” Jason Redulla, chief of Hawaii’s Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement (DOCARE) said in a statement, which bore the ominous warning that “someone is going to get hurt or killed.”

According to DOCARE, all the people arrested in the past week have been charged with criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor that can result in up to 30 days in jail. Eight of the 14 were arrested on September 3, although it’s not clear if they were hiking together.

“It is dangerous for people to enter the construction zone and dangerous for them to try to descend the ridge. They need to think about the consequences if someone gets hurt, or worse, and needs rescue. It is a difficult place for first responders to reach, which could delay medical treatment,” said Redulla.

The Haiku Stairs, sometimes called the “stairway to heaven,” were closed to the public in 1987. But social media has brought the unlikely destination a degree of fame, with intrepid YouTubers and Instagrammers raving about the gorgeous views from atop the 2,800-foot mountain trail, with the stairs sometimes appearing to disappear into the mist above.

According to DOCARE, the hikers used climbing ropes to get to the staircase.

The stairs’ fame has brought headaches for the local community, including trespassers, added security costs and risky rescues of hikers who have been injured in the remote area.

In 2021, the Honolulu City Council voted to remove the Haiku Stairs. The work has been done in pieces, with one section of the stairs at a time detached from the side of the mountain and then removed by helicopter.

A local group called Friends of the Haiku Stairs is pushing back against the stairs’ removal, arguing that the $2.5 million process is too expensive.

Some of the deconstruction work had been completed when the Hawaii Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction earlier this year."

CNN —

No sooner have airports introduced new scanning machines so you don’t need to unpack your carry-on bags, than a trend emerges where you photograph all your loose items in your airport security tray.

The “airport tray aesthetic” has taken off on TikTok, Instagram and Pinterest as people share artfully arranged shots of their sunglasses, shoes, toiletries and reading material inside the regulation polypropylene dishes.

Don’t expect crumpled plastic bags stuffed with toothpaste and Pepto-Bismol. This is aspirational travel, where your 35mm film camera nestles between your vintage loafers and your first-edition copy of “On the Road.”

It’s the latest in a line of trends where people curate their possessions for a public showcase, from bookshelves to bedside tables to even the insides of our refrigerators. (Yes, “fridgescaping,” which involves storing flowers and picture frames alongside your butter and eggs, is now a thing).

However, the trend is ruffling more than a few feathers, due to the airport security line being one of the top places in the world where it’s imperative to avoid dilly-dallying.

Think-pieces have naturally been spilling forth.

The New York Post slammed the “time-consuming trend” as an influencer-led blight upon the nation’s TSA lines.

The UK’s Metro newspaper said that “‘the anxiety-inducing trend’ risks you becoming the most hated person in the airport.”

Comments on Shop Pursue’s TikTok video showing young women preparing for a “girls’ trip” by organizing their Adidas Gazelles and Louis Vuitton bags on a bench range from “ik the people behind yall were annoyed waiting” to “you would get tased in JFK for this.”

However, like many things happening online, all is not quite what it seems.

In a TikTok video with 82,000 likes so far, New York-based influencer Chelsea as of Late gives a step-by-step tutorial on following the trend and not being a nuisance.

The key, she says, is to do it after going through security: Find a quiet spot and “if you have time set up a few different trays, cause why not?”

That, however, is still an area intended for travelers who need it for necessary repacking of items or for a more urgent rest stop.

Let’s also not forget that with all those shoes passing through security trays, you may as well be laying your items straight out on the floor. In 2018, a European study found that airport trays are the least hygienic part of the airport, carrying more germs than toilets.

So while hand sanitizer doesn’t typically feature in these airport tray photos and videos, it should probably play a key part in the aftercare.

The trend has unsurprisingly been a huge hit with marketing teams around the world, with brands including clothing and homeware retailers Anthropologie and book publishers Faber all posting their stylized boxes.

Storage solutions brand Stackers told CNN, “This trend specifically aligned perfectly for us, curating an aesthetic selection whilst focusing on our travel-friendly products.”

A lot of the most delightfully organized boxes don’t involve a trip to the airport at all.

In one of the most popular TikTok videos on the “airportaesthetic” hashtag, with 1.8 million views, Chicago-based content creator Piper Taich gives a tutorial explaining that her airport security tub was purchased on Amazon and her boarding pass was edited on Photoshop.

She then curates her travel-themed selections to her heart’s content.

“If you’re asking what the point of this is, the point is that it’s fun and that it’s art,” she says. “It’s a really fun way to express my love of fashion and thrifting and artistic direction.”

“As long as the staged glamor photos are not causing delays or issues with other passengers in the checkpoint, there are no issues,"" says the TSA. iiStockphoto/Getty Images

The rise of social media and increasingly advanced and accessible filming and editing software means that individuals are able to put together home-created masterpieces like never before, from dance videos to comedy sketches to makeup tutorials.

Against these pros, there are the cons. With rose-tinted snapshots of other people’s lives flooding our feeds 24/7, the social comparison is having a big impact on mental health, especially for younger people.

As for the airport tray aesthetic, while people might be getting het up at the idea of Gen Z holding up the line for some navel-gazing, the US Transport Security Administration is sanguine about the risk.

“The TSA has become aware of this trend recently,” a spokesperson told CNN. “As long as the staged glamor photos are not causing delays or issues with other passengers in the checkpoint, there are no issues. Travelers should take care to secure their IDs, passports and any light items on top that could be swept out of the bins when they go into the machines.”

For a screen break during their flight, some virally minded travelers might consider “rawdogging” – what we used to call staring out the window. And when you reach your destination, you can always put your phone down and go for a swim or a hike – life has to be lived before we can document it."

travel,Swiss rebalancing planes because first class seats are too heavy,2024-09-03,Julia Buckley,"The desire to fly in style weighs heavily on most of us – but for some first-class flyers it weighs the heaviest of all.

Swiss – Switzerland’s flag carrier – is having to make alterations to some of its aircraft because new first class seats, due to be installed as a much needed revamp, are proving to be too heavy.

The new jumbo seats on the Airbus A330s – which include six-foot walls and locking doors for each suite – are seated at the front of the plane, making the aircraft nose-heavy. Swiss will have to fit a massive “balancing plate” at the back of the plane to recenter the balance of the aircraft.

The new seats, called “Swiss Senses,” were announced in 2023 for a debut of winter 2025-2026. The airline has promised a full made-in-Switzerland experience, with up to 37 square foot “suites” in first class with sliding doors and walls shielding passengers from their fellow mortals.

In a statement, Swiss said that as industry trends mean that first and business class seats get heavier (to provide more privacy) and economy seats get lighter, “these two contrasting trends are changing the center of gravity of the aircraft in which such seats are installed.”

It said that aircraft types that tend towards being nose-heavy anyway are particularly affected – and unfortunately the A330 is one of those. The airline will also be retrofitting Boeing 777s with the new seats – but without the same issue. Its Airbus A340s will not be getting the new seats.

On the A330s, Swiss will therefore be adding a “balancing plate” to correct the center of gravity. It will be calculated once the new cabin interiors are installed and weighed precisely, and will “remain aboard these aircraft until other options can be developed,” the spokesperson said, adding that the airline will be scouting technology that could replace the plate.

The plate – positioned at the back of the aircraft – will not be visible to passengers in economy. The airline cannot confirm its exact weight, said the spokesperson, as they will have to wait for the final weight of the seats in order to calculate the counterweight.

Swiss says that passengers have been calling for it to renovate its current first class cabin. From SWISS

Unusually for a European airline, Swiss offers a first-class cabin on all its longhaul flights. It was voted best European airline first class in the 2024 World Travel Awards.

The new, weighty interiors were driven by customer feedback, said the spokesperson, who told the airline “in no uncertain terms that it is time we modernized the cabin interiors of our longhaul aircraft, and especially our Airbus A330-300s.” The aircraft currently operate routes from Switzerland to the Middle East, and US and Canada east coast.

The airline has tried to reduce adding weight elsewhere, by not planning for sliding doors in business class seats, as other airlines have brought in, and by trimming the first class cabin from eight seats to four. The spokesperson said that adding more seats in economy to add weight at the back of the plane had been considered, but rejected to preserve comfort in the cheaper seats.

Swiss denied it was a “planning error,” saying that while planning the cabin they used “rough estimates” of weight, which have now grown as manufacturing begins and will be confirmed once the new seats are installed.

Its partner airline Lufthansa has also committed to the new seats for its revamped “Allegris” cabins, but a spokesperson for the German flag carrier confirmed that Lufthansa won’t be retrofitting any A330s, so won’t have the same issue.

Flying first class is, of course, the most environmentally damaging way of flying commercial. The heavier seats and maximized space means that it is far less efficient than flying in a regular economy seat.

The current first class seats on Swiss weigh 205 kilograms or 452 pounds. The final weight of the new seats “will not be known until [they are] installed,” said the spokesperson."

travel,European travelers will have to pay to enter the UK in 2025,2024-09-10,Tamara Hardingham-Gill,"European travelers visiting the UK without a visa will soon be required to pay a £10 (around $13) waiver fee.

The new rules, which will come into effect over the next year, will see the UK’s electronic travel authorization (ETA) system, first introduced for Qatar nationals, expanded to include travelers from all other countries, including European Union citizens.

The non-refundable fee will apply to all visitors to the UK, including babies and children, without a visa, or permission to live, work or study, according to plans announced by UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.

At present, citizens of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are required to apply for an ETA before entering the UK.

This will be extended to include most other nationals, including those from the US but excluding Europeans, in November. By next spring, the program will be expanded again to incorporate European nationals.

The rules will not apply to Irish citizens.

“Once fully rolled out, the ETA scheme will close the current gap in advance permissions and mean that for the first time, we will have a comprehensive understanding of those traveling to the UK,” Cooper said in a statement.

Jordanian nationals can no longer apply for an ETA to enter the UK, according to the UK government website.

Visa waiver schemes are certainly not a new thing. The United States’ electronic travel authorization ESTA, which now costs $21 and lasts two years, was first introduced back in 2009.

Meanwhile, the roll out of the European Union’s ETIAS, valid for three years, which will cost travelers 7 euros (about $7.50,) has been postponed to 2025.

travel,Bali considering a ban on new hotels amid overtourism struggles,2024-09-10,Unknown,"Reuters —

Indonesia has agreed to set a moratorium on the construction of hotels, villas and nightclubs in some areas on the tourist resort island of Bali, as it grapples with the over-development of land, a senior ministry official said on September 9.

The moratorium is part of the government’s bid to reform tourism on Bali, one of Indonesia’s main attractions, to try to boost quality and jobs while preserving the island’s indigenous culture.

Hermin Esti, a senior official at the Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs, told Reuters the government had agreed to set the moratorium, although the exact timeline was still being discussed.

On Saturday, Bali’s interim governor Sang Made Mahendra Jaya said he suggested the moratorium in four of Bali’s busy areas to the central government, taking aim at over-development for commercial purposes, such as hotels, villas and beach clubs.

The governor’s office and Indonesia’s tourism ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.

The moratorium could stretch up to 10 years, senior minister Luhut Pandjaitan was quoted by news website Detik as saying on September 8.

Luhut has previously said about 200,000 foreigners now live in Bali, contributing to problems such as crime, over-development and competition for jobs.

Foreign arrivals in Bali have surged since it re-opened for tourism after the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos of misbehaving tourists often go viral, angering residents and sparking harsh responses from social media users in Indonesia.

Government figures show 2.9 million foreign visitors arrived through Bali airport in the first half of the year, making up 65% of total foreign arrivals in Indonesia by air.

There were 541 hotels in Bali last year, the figures show, up from 507 in 2019."

City mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida announced the decision on Thursday, and the local council published a statement saying the three companies had failed to meet the conditions set out in their permits, which were granted in May 2023.

The council said the companies blocked its efforts to inspect their operations by not providing required information or granting access to their interfaces. Nonetheless, it said, it had managed to ascertain that they had not met the terms of the permits.

“These failures include a lack of service across the whole city, a lack of insurance coverage and the absence of technology that prevents the vehicles from circulating or parking in prohibited areas,” it said.

Lime, Dott and Tier were the companies selected to offer e-scooter rental in Madrid, with permits granted for 2,000 scooters each. The council’s decision means “rental scooters will disappear from the city from October,” it said.

Once the process of revoking the permits has started, the companies will have 20 days to appeal the decision, it added.

A spokesman for Dott told CNN on Monday that the company had received an official notification from Madrid city hall on Thursday.

“We are now assessing the situation of shared e-scooters service and are waiting for a meeting with Madrid municipality before taking any decision,” the spokesman said in a statement.

“We expect that a constructive dialogue is possible with the municipality to understand the reasons for the announced decision so that we can address them properly and maintain a useful mobility service for Madrilenians and visitors,” the spokesman added.

A spokesperson for Lime told CNN the company was “disappointed by this surprise move,” and that it believed “the stated grounds for this decision were misplaced.”

“We will explore ways to support our riders in Madrid to ensure they have access to safe, affordable and sustainable transport options and look forward to continuing discussions with the Council to ensure service can continue,” the spokesperson added.

CNN has also contacted Tier for comment.

Madrid council will not grant any further e-scooter operating permits, Mayor Martínez-Almeida added in the statement, “as it has been shown that the market cannot meet the necessary requirements established by the council that guarantee the highest level of citizen safety possible.”

Private electric scooters remain legal in the city, according to the city hall website.

Madrid is not the first city to take action against e-scooter rentals, which have become increasingly divisive.

In August, officials in the Australian city of Melbourne decided to ban e-scooter rentals, citing safety concerns following hundreds of complaints and accident reports.

“This was an opportunity to end the havoc on Melbourne’s footpaths and make our city safe again,” Melbourne Mayor Nicholas Reece reportedly said at a press conference.

And in April 2023, residents of Paris voted in favor of banning rental electric scooters from the French capital, with the ban coming into force at the end of August, when the scooter operators’ contracts expired.

travel,Federal probe targets airline frequent flyer programs,2024-09-05,Pete Muntean,"Airlines’ highly lucrative – and sometimes mysterious – frequent flyer and credit card rewards programs are now subject to an unprecedented federal consumer protection probe.

The Department of Transportation told executives of the country’s four major airlines on Thursday to divulge details and data surrounding the policies and practices of how passengers can accrue and spend miles.

“Our goal with this inquiry is to ensure that customer rewards are protected from any practices that would diminish their value, benefit, or availability,” says the letter to the CEOs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, which now have 90 days to respond to the Department of Transportation.

The DOT’s probe is focused on how consumers could be affected by the devaluation of earned rewards, extra fees, hidden or dynamic pricing and reduced competition and choice.

The department aims to protect customers from “potential unfair, deceptive, or anticompetitive practices,” it said in a news release.

In Thursday’s announcement, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said airline miles “have become such a meaningful part of our economy that many Americans view their rewards points balances as part of their savings.”

Industry group Airlines for America said in a statement that consumers “have the power of choice” when selecting airlines for their travels and carriers offer loyalty programs as a way to reward travelers for their “return business and brand loyalty” in a fiercely competitive environment.

“Millions of people enjoy being a part of various loyalty programs, which allow them to accumulate rewards to apply toward travel or other benefits,” Airlines for America said. “U.S. carriers are transparent about these programs, and policymakers should ensure that consumers can continue to be offered these important benefits.”"

travel,Rome may limit tourist access to Trevi Fountain,2024-09-06,Story Reuters,"Rome Reuters —

Rome is considering limiting access to the Trevi Fountain, one of its busiest monuments, ahead of an expected bumper year for tourism in the Eternal City, city council officials say.

The Italian capital is preparing to host the 2025 Jubilee, a year-long Roman Catholic event expected to attract 32 million tourists and pilgrims.

Under the draft plans, visits to the fountain would require a prior reservation, with fixed time slots and a limited number of people allowed to access the steps around it.

“For Romans we are thinking of making it free, while non-residents would be asked to make a symbolic contribution, one or two euros ($1.10-2.20),” Rome’s tourism councillor, Alessandro Onorato, told Thursday’s Il Messaggero newspaper.

On Wednesday, Mayor Roberto Gualtieri called measures to curb tourist numbers “a very concrete possibility.”

“The situation at the Trevi Fountain is becoming technically very difficult to manage,” he told reporters.

Other cities are facing protests over problems brought by so-called overtourism, including Barcelona and Venice, where local authorities this year tested an entry charge arrangement for visitors.

The Trevi Fountain, where tradition dictates that visitors toss a coin to guarantee their return to Rome and fulfil their wishes, has long been a major attraction, even for visiting world leaders.

Completed in 1762, the monument is a late Baroque masterpiece, with statues of Tritons guiding the shell chariot of the god Oceanus, illustrating the theme of the taming of the waters.

It is also remembered for one of cinema’s most famous scenes, when in Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” Anita Ekberg wades into the fountain and beckons her co-star Marcello Mastroianni to join her: “Marcello! Come here!”"

travel,Austrian man arrested for having sex in Japanese shrine,2024-09-04,"Issy Ronald, Yumi Asada","Tokyo CNN —

A 61-year-old Austrian man was arrested last month for having sex in a shrine in Japan with a Japanese woman in her 40s, local police told CNN on Wednesday.

The couple were caught having sex on August 22 while in the grounds of a shrine in Kesennuma –- a small coastal town about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Tokyo –- and faced charges of disrespecting a place of worship.

Police told CNN that they arrested the man, fearing he could be a flight risk, but did not arrest the woman after concluding there was no risk of her fleeing.

The man has since been released from custody, but the police said they could not disclose details of his punishment and did not clarify whether he was a tourist or a resident. These cases don’t always end in forced repatriation, the police added, and can result in a fine.

Although such a case is rare, there have been other instances of people being arrested for disrespecting Japanese shrines.

Last year, a 17-year-old Canadian was brought in for questioning for allegedly scratching the name “Julian” with his nail into a wooden pillar at a UNESCO-listed temple in the historic city of Nara, local police told CNN at the time.

“The boy admitted his act and says it was done not with the intent of harming Japanese culture,” a police official said. “He is now with his parents, who were with him when the incident occurred.”

Meanwhile in 2010, famed photographer Kishin Shinoyama was charged with public indecency and disrespect for a religious site when he allegedly took nude photos at a public cemetery."

travel,Lightning strike damages 4th century arch near Colosseum as freak storm hits Rome,2024-09-04,Barbie Latza Nadeau,"Rome CNN —

A lightning strike knocked a chunk of stone off Rome’s ancient Arch of Constantine, just meters from the Colosseum, amid a sudden violent storm that struck the Italian capital late Tuesday, according to archaeological authorities.

No one was injured and all of the debris was collected and will be assessed for damage. The 4th century arch was undergoing renovations, which will now turn to repair work, the superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park said in a statement.

“It seems important to us to underscore that just two days ago the restoration site of the southern front of the Arch of Constantine began and therefore we can confirm that it is a case that combines scheduled maintenance (relative to the restoration already planned) and emergency protection promptly carried out,” the statement reads.

Several tourists seeking shelter from the heavy rain said they heard the lightning strike the arch and then saw the debris fall, according to Reuters.

Roads were closed at the nearby Circus Maximus track after two large trees fell, damaging several cars and partially collapsing a grandstand set up for a concert. The Trevi Fountain also flooded in the storm, police said.

The storm, which was not predicted in earlier forecasts, was similar to the downburst that sank a luxury yacht off the coast of Sicily on August 19, killing seven people including British tech titan Michael Lynch, according to Italy’s Civil Protection agency. More than 60 millimeters (2.36 inches) of rain – the average monthly amount for September – fell on Rome in less than an hour, the agency said.

The arch, which was built in 315 AD to honor the emperor Constantine’s victory over Maxentius, is more than 80 feet tall and stands inside the Colosseum archeological compound, where tourists queue to enter the ancient amphitheater.

The storm also flooded the lower tunnels of the Colosseum, which remained closed on Wednesday. Rome’s mayor, Roberto Gaultieri, met with the head of the Civil Protection, the Department of Public Works and the Department of the Environment along with local law enforcement to assess the damage. “We made an initial provisional assessment – tomorrow we will make the definitive one – of the damage of the incredible water bomb that hit the center of Rome, of the preventive interventions already carried out and those carried out today on an emergency basis,” he wrote in a post on X.

More severe weather is forecast for Thursday in the Italian capital."

travel,Korean Air is removing a popular snack from flights. Turbulence is to blame,2024-08-01,Lilit Marcus,"Airplane turbulence is often the culprit when someone’s suitcase falls out of an overhead bin.

Now, though, it’s being blamed for prompting an airline to remove a popular food from its inflight offerings.

Korean Air has announced that from August 15, it will no longer serve ramyeon instant noodles to passengers traveling in economy class on long-haul flights.

​​“In the case of ramyeon service, burn accidents occur frequently due to hot water,” the airline said in a press release. “In economy class, flight attendants must move several cups of noodles filled with hot water at once, and passengers are crowded together, so the risk of burns has been high.”

The airline explained that the change to its inflight snack service on long-distance routes is “in response to the increasing trend of turbulence.” According to the airline, the number of turbulence occurrences more than doubled in 2024 compared to 2019.

Korean Air said that the move was “part of a proactive measure” that is “aimed at preventing burn accidents.”

“To enhance passenger satisfaction and diversify snack options, a self-service snack bar is also available on long-haul flights. We are committed to ensuring passenger safety and will select snacks on each route based on customer preferences,” the release added.

Those snacks include sandwiches, corn dogs, pizza and hot pockets.

Passengers in prestige and first-class cabins will still be able to get ramyeon on board, though.

Korean Air, which was ranked the 11th best airline in the world for 2024, is one of the many aviation companies thinking about the long-term risks of turbulence, which experts say is increasing because of climate change.

In 2022, Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK, told CNN Travel that industry models predicted a double or triple-fold increase in turbulence in the coming years.

“Typically, on a transatlantic flight, you might expect 10 minutes of turbulence. I think that in a few decades this may increase to 20 minutes or to half an hour,” he said.

In some cases, pilots will tell flight attendants to stop serving hot food or drinks during turbulent periods.

In May of this year, severe turbulence on a flight from London to Singapore was so bad that one passenger died and 71 more were injured.

Meal trays, food containers, plastic bottles and tea and coffee pots were among the items that fell to the ground during the violent turbulence."

travel,Why Bolivia is Latin America’s next dining destination,2024-05-28,Joe Yogerst,"Bolivia doesn’t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes.

Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries — Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi — currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it’s not just La Paz. Bolivia’s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats.

The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. “There was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,” Taha said.

Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of “zero-kilometer cuisine” — using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things.

“By showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,” adds Sebastián Giménez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral.

Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine

It’s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent’s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013.

Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent’s top restaurants.

Merging Bolivia’s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means “delicious” in the Quechua language of the Andes).

Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale.

Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu’s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. “Learning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.”

Variations on the theme

Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven.

“We’re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,” says chef Sebastián Giménez. “We have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.”

Food of the devil

The chefs at these top-shelf restaurants don’t have to look far for basic ingredients. Many of the building blocks of their fusion foods are native to the Andes valleys and foothills that extend all the way along Bolivia’s western side from Lake Titicaca to Argentina.

More than 4,000 potato types are cultivated in Bolivia and its Andean neighbors, many of them found in just a single, small valley. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors and slightly different flavors.

Even more than spuds, Bolivians cherish their quinoa. The country boasts more than 3,100 varieties of quinoa, which contrary to popular opinion is actually the seed of a flowering pseudocereal plant rather than a true grain.

An exhibit at the new visitor center in the silver mining town of San Cristóbal points out that Spanish conquistadors and padres considered quinoa the “food of the devil” and banned its consumption as a way to control the local indigenous people.

Five centuries later, NASA declared quinoa “the perfect food to grow in indoor greenhouses” during long voyages in outer space because of its resistance to adverse conditions (such as growing in the Andes), versatility and high protein content.

No longer vilified as Satan’s feast, it’s also an ideal ingredient for Bolivia’s new-wave cuisine.

Zero-kilometer goes wider

Sucre, the nation’s judicial capital in south-central Bolivia, isn’t as cosmopolitan as La Paz when it comes to food. But it’s gradually catching up.

Located across the street from the city’s Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Joy Ride Cafe was founded as a tourist restaurant but evolved into a local hangout for date nights, after-work parties and Sucrense craving burgers, pasta and other global eats.

But right down the block is the fusion fare of El Solar. The seven-course degustation menu features dishes such as seafood rice flavored with Amazonian citrus juice, pork belly with pepper sauce and a creamy puree made from plantain and yuca; and beef loin with charque (llama jerky). All of this for 80 bolivianos (roughly $12).

Located in southwest Bolivia about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of La Paz, the otherworldly Salar de Uyuni is the world’s largest and most spectacular salt flat as well as Bolivia’s top tourist attraction. Once upon a time, it was primarily a backpacker destination, but in recent years, more well-heeled travelers (and social media influencers) have sparked a transformation of the local dining scene.

Chef Tania López also uses the term “zero-kilometer cuisine” to describe the menu at Tika. Among her signature dishes are a sun-dried, shredded llama jerky with local white cheese and a piquant yellow chili pepper sauce, bubbling k’alaphurka corn soup, and lake trout filets in a basil pesto “lagoon” with quinoa risotto.

López says one of the closest dishes at Tika to what the ancient Inca may have eaten is the llama potojchi. “Preparation takes more time than beef,” she explains of a succulent dish that resembles goulash. “We still do this in the traditional way from many centuries ago — heated on lava rocks.”

Dishes that the Incas never tasted — but would probably die for — are Tika’s house-made desserts, in particular the quinoa and purple corn ice creams.

Tika also does upscale takeaway, meals for a remote picnic that diners can enable on their own or via a 4x4 adventure with Hidalgo Tours, which sets up a table, chairs and bar at a remote location in the middle of the salt flat.

But that’s not to say that Bolivia’s food revolution has reached every nook and cranny.

An hour boat ride from the mainland in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is the legendary birthplace of Inca civilization and a place still deeply rooted in the Andean past.

On its open-air terrace overlooking the water, the island’s Tacana restaurant serves a traditional pachamanca lunch that includes llama, lake fish, potatoes, corn and other locally sourced dishes — not all that different than what the Inca rulers would have eaten during their pilgrimages to the island more than 500 years ago."
travel,Why Bolivia is Latin America’s next dining destination,2024-05-28,Joe Yogerst,"Bolivia doesn’t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes.

Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries — Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi — currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it’s not just La Paz. Bolivia’s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats.

The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. “There was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,” Taha said.

Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of “zero-kilometer cuisine” — using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things.

“By showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,” adds Sebastián Giménez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral.

Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine

It’s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent’s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013.

Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent’s top restaurants.

Merging Bolivia’s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means “delicious” in the Quechua language of the Andes).

Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale.

Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu’s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. “Learning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.”

Variations on the theme

Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven.

“We’re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,” says chef Sebastián Giménez. “We have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.”

But don’t expect traditional Andean or Amazon dishes. Ancestral offers a delicious fusion of old and new in offerings such as the chuletón ribeye steak, trout ceviche with grilled corn and sweet potato, and porchetta pork roast with Bolivian tubers and red aji sauce.

CNN —

Dubai in 1993 was a world away from the global capital of today.

The finance and construction industries had yet to rumble into high gear. The city had yet to establish itself as a destination for the rich and powerful. The tallest building remained the first skyscraper ever built in Dubai: the World Trade Center at a mere 149 meters tall.

That year, British architecture firm Atkins Global was approached by the Dubai ruler’s office with a brief to design a building that would “create an identifiable link for people around the world with the UAE.”

In other words: put the Emirates on the map.

Simon Crispe, Atkins’ managing director in the Middle East at the time, recalls being asked “to provide the UAE with the powerful visual symbol of the same significance Sydney’s Opera House is to Australia or Paris’ Tour Eiffel is to France.”

An international team of architects spent the next seven years under a veil of secrecy creating the man-made island and 321-meter tall building.

The Burj al Arab ﻿(which means “Arabian Tower” in Arabic) opened its doors in 1999, and in the following two decades became a magnet for the global elite. The hotel is now a byword for the height of luxury from its palatial suites to rare sharks housed in the aquarium.

But one feature has arguably done the most to forge the Burj’s reputation.

Taking the aerial route

Suspended 212 meters above sea level, the hotel’s helipad juts out precariously from the distinctive sail shape of the building.

“The main challenge was ensuring that the helipad was structurally sound and supported the overall architecture of the hotel,” the Burj al Arab’s former managing director, Anthony Costa, told CNN in 2019. The 27-meter-wide helipad can accommodate a maximum weight of 7.5 tons.

“The helipad had to meet both structural and safe landing criteria,” Crispe told CNN in 2019. “It needed to ‘float’ visually and we only wanted a minimal visible supporting steelwork.”

The helipad’s principle function is as part of the hotel’s concierge service. Guests can choose to be picked up from the airport in a Rolls Royce, or take advantage of a helicopter transfer service.

The aerial route is a popular option, said Costa, with many arrivals and departures each month by helicopter.

Legendary stunts

Beyond its basic function, the helipad is better known as a location for stunts that range from death-defying to merely awesome.

Roger Federer got the ball rolling in 2005 when he played an exhibition match with Andre Agassi on a court created for the occasion and filmed by helicopter. The Swiss would return in 2012 with rival Novak Djokovic.

The helipad has also been made over as a golf course to allow Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy to tee off over the Persian Gulf.

In 2017, a ring was constructed for British boxer Anthony Joshua to take part in a sparring session.

The most challenging stunt to date came in 2013, when a Formula 1 racing car was airlifted onto the helipad to allow David Coulthard to spin “doughnuts” on a specially-created surface, said Costa. Atkins engineers were brought in again to ensure the stunt could proceed safely.

The location has since become an attraction for daredevils of all stripes, serving as a platform for a record-breaking kiteboarding jump, a BMX jump from a helicopter, and skydivers. In 2023, Polish pilot Lukasz Czepiela made aviation history when he became the first person to land a plane on the Burj Al Arab’s helipad.

Many more stunts are rejected, according to Costa: “Every requested stunt is evaluated from logistical, health and safety and feasibility points of view before it goes ahead.”

Party venue

Stunts made the helipad world-famous, but the hotel has also introduced safer ways to enjoy it.

Since 2014, the helipad has been available for weddings designed by a specialist “wedding architect” with a starting price of $55,000, although some ceremonies have reportedly run into millions of dollars.

The location is also hired out for private parties with bespoke trimmings. Costa said his favorite helipad moment came with a guest’s 50th birthday in 2018.

“We repainted the helipad to read ‘Happy Birthday’ with her name, which she could see from the helicopter as she landed,” he recalled.

Such lavish occasions and expenditure might seem frivolous, but as one of Dubai’s great icons, there is a responsibility to showcase spectacle and grandeur.

As Costa puts it, the helipad events are “elevating Dubai and its reputation for delivering spectacular experiences.”

Government ministries often partner with the hotel to deliver helipad events, and use it heavily in promotional campaigns.

The Burj al Arab was first commissioned with the intention of establishing Dubai and the UAE on the global map.

Twenty-five years on from its inauguration that ambition has been realized – with no little help from the world’s most famous helipad."

sport,Tyreek Hill: What we know about Miami Dolphins star’s detainment by police,2024-09-10,"George Ramsay, Ben Morse, Wayne Sterling, David Close, Kevin Dotson, Homero De La Fuente","It’s been an eventful few days for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill, who was handcuffed and detained by Miami-Dade Police shortly before his team’s opening game Sunday.

The detention, for what his agent called a moving violation, was just temporary, and Hill later scored a stellar 80-yard touchdown in a close win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He celebrated the score by putting his arms behind his back with his wrists together – a cheeky nod to his pregame incident.

But off the field, the detention has led to a public back-and-forth between the Dolphins and police and has renewed the debate over how law enforcement handles traffic stops and interacts with members of the public.

On Monday night, police released nearly two hours of body-camera footage showing the interaction with Hill and other Dolphins players at the scene. A police union criticized Hill as “uncooperative.”

In turn, the Dolphins organization released a statement criticizing the officers’ conduct, and Hill told CNN he remained confused by the encounter.

“I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it,” Hill said. “I’m embarrassed.”

Here’s what we know about Hill’s detention before the game on Sunday and its aftermath.

The Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) released body-worn camera footage from the incident unexpectedly on Monday night.

“While standard protocol is to release bodycam footage after the internal review has concluded, the available bodycam footage – a combined 105 minutes 33 seconds – is being released the day following the incident to reinforce the Department’s commitment to keeping the public informed,” Director Stephanie V. Daniels of the police department said in a statement.

The footage shows a police officer approaching Hill’s car and knocking on the window after he signaled for Hill to pull over. Hill rolls down the window when the officer knocks and replies, “Hey, don’t knock on my window like that.” The officer asks Hill why he doesn’t have a seatbelt on. Hill doesn’t answer and repeatedly says, “Don’t knock on my window like that.”

The officer asks why Hill had his window up and says he had to knock to let Hill know he was there.

“Give me my ticket bro so I can go, I’m going to be late. Do what you got to do,” Hill said before rolling up the window.

The officer tells him to keep his window down and knocks again, but Hill doesn’t appear to respond. The officer knocks again and tells Hill to keep his window down. Hill rolls down his window slightly and responds, “Don’t tell me what to do.”

The officer threatens to make Hill get out of the car if he doesn’t keep the window down, and then immediately after orders him out. Another officer opens Hill’s car door and starts to pull him out of the car, saying, “Get out!” while Hill responds, “I’m getting out.”

Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting out, I’m getting out,” and the same officer says, “Too late.”

Two officers are seen pushing Hill to the ground while another officer stands over. Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting arrested” multiple times, and the one officer physically restraining him says, “When we tell you to do something, you do it. You understand? You understand? Not what you want, but what we tell you. You’re a little f**cking confused.”

“Alright bro, take me to jail, bro do what you gotta do,” Hill says. “We will,” the officer responds.

The time from when the officer first knocks on Hill’s window to when he is fully handcuffed on the ground is around a minute and a half. The officers then move Hill to his feet and have him sit on the sidewalk. As an officer slowly leads him to sit on the ground, Hill says “Hold on, bro. I just had surgery on my knee.” As he is speaking, another officer comes behind him and puts an arm around his chest. He begins to pull Hill toward the ground as Hill repeats, “I just had surgery on my knee.”

The restraining officer says, “Really, what a coincidence. Did you have surgery on your ears when we told you to put the window down?”

“Bro, chill!” Hill yells.

Hill tells CNN he’s still in shock

Hill spoke with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Monday, saying everything happened very fast.

“I was following rules, I wasn’t moving fast because you know I got injuries, I got things that I go through. I play a physical sport, I’ve been doing this for a moment now man so I’m dealing with some stuff, so I guess the officers, they felt like I wasn’t doing it on their timing. I was doing it, but I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it,” Hill said. “I’m embarrassed.”

Hill further reflected on the moment that things escalated, saying that it started when officers asked him to roll down his window.

“When the officer came up and knocked on my window, I let my window down, cooperated, gave them my I.D. Then I immediately let up my window, and then after that I let back up my window, and then he came back to the window and was like, ‘Let your window down now, let your window down now’ and then I let it down,” Hill said.

“I’m not trying to cause a scene because … if I let my window down, people walking by, driving by, they’re going to notice that it’s me and they’re going to start taking pictures. I didn’t want to create a scene at all, I just really wanted to get the ticket and then just go out about my way and have a great Sunday.”

The 30-year-old was asked about an earlier quote of his about how the situation could’ve unfolded differently if he wasn’t Tyreek Hill.

“The reality of it is, it’s the truth. If I wasn’t Tyreek Hill, worst-case scenario, we would’ve had a different article. ‘Tyreek Hill got shot in front of Hard Rock Stadium,’ that’s worst-case scenario,” Hill said. “It’s crazy that me and my family had to go through this.”

Hill’s teammate also placed in handcuffs

A second Dolphins player, Calais Campbell, was also handcuffed when trying to discuss the situation with officers at the scene, according to police.

Speaking to ESPN on Monday, the 38-year-old defensive lineman recalled how he arrived at the scene of his teammate’s detention and attempted to diffuse the situation. He said he got out of his car with his hands up and approached the police officers, explaining, “I’m a friend of his (Hill). I don’t know what’s going on here, but I think the situation is definitely unnecessary.”

Campbell said he was told to leave, with an officer threatening to tow his car if he didn’t go away.

“I told him I will stand where you want me to stand. You tell me how far I need to back up, and I’ll back up, but I’m not leaving the scene,” Campbell recounted. “This is my friend here. I’m here to support him. I’m not leaving.”

When he remained, Campbell said the officer told him he was under arrest and put him in handcuffs.

Campbell said Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith was also at the scene as Hill pleaded with both teammates: “Don’t leave me. Don’t leave me.”

Now in his 17th season, Campbell has previously won the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award, given annually to a player “for his excellence on and off the field.” This is his first season with the Dolphins.

Campbell told ESPN he was thankful he was there to support Hill.

“These situations can escalate quickly. We see it so many times in America where these things go completely bad. This is a big opportunity for us to use this platform to combat police brutality that happens. This situation could have been a whole lot worse had we not been there.”

Dolphins organization slams police conduct

After the bodycam footage was released, the Miami Dolphins released a three-paragraph statement criticizing the “the overly aggressive and violent conduct directed towards Tyreek Hill, Calais Campbell and Jonnu Smith by police officers.”

“It is both maddening and heartbreaking to watch the very people we trust to protect our community use such unnecessary force and hostility towards these players, yet it is also a reminder that not every situation like this ends in peace, as we are grateful this one did,” the team said.

The team said they have a positive relationship with the police and praised the “vast majority of officers.”

“However, as is on full display in the videos released tonight, there are some officers who mistake their responsibility and commitment to serve with misguided power,” the team said. “While we commend MDPD for taking the right and necessary action to quickly release this footage, we also urge them to take equally swift and strong action against the officers who engaged in such despicable behavior.”

Earlier Monday, Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel said he was unsettled by the incident.

“It’s been hard for me not to find myself more upset the more I think about it,” McDaniel said at a press conference. “And that’s because of my teammates and trying to put myself in that situation that they described emotionally, and then knowing more than that, the thing that f**ks me up, honestly, is knowing that I don’t know exactly what that feels like.”

“I do think that it’s supremely important to wait for information to be gathered before any rush to judement, but regardless I know the feelings expressed to me are unsettling,” he added.

Still, he said two positive things came from the incident. “I’m super proud of teammates being teammates, and super proud of our guys understanding the civic responsibility of a platform and intending to do right by it.”

Hill’s agent Drew Rosenhaus described the incident as “heartbreaking, upsetting and uncalled for,” saying he was “in disbelief” about what took place ahead of the game.

“Tyreek was just trying to get to work, trying to play a game, just trying to do his job,” Rosenhaus said on “CNN News Central.” “For police officers to detain him, to put him on the ground like that, to put their knee on him, to hit him – it’s just devastating.”

In separate comments to ESPN, Rosenhaus said that Hill was “OK physically” but mentally “very distraught” by the situation, adding: “Tyreek has told me over and over he’s a big supporter of police. He was telling the police there, ‘I want to be a police officer in the future.’ But this is crazy, I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Police union says Hill was not cooperative

Daniels, the police director, said she initiated an internal investigation into the incident, adding that one of the officers involved has been placed on administrative duties.

“I’m committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.”

The local police union has defended the actions of the officers involved.

“Upon being stopped, Mr. Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr. Hill in handcuffs,” Steadman Stahl, president of the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement to CNN.

“Mr. Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground. Once the situation was sorted out within a few minutes, Mr. Hill was issued two traffic citations and was free to leave.

“In this case, while we will wait for the investigation to run its course, based on what we know, we stand with the actions of our officers but look forward to further open communication moving forward,” Stahl added.

Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, meanwhile, praised the “immediate steps” taken by the MDPD in the aftermath of the incident to investigate what occurred.

“In recent years our nation has confronted important conversations on the use of force, and the internal review process will answer questions about why the troubling actions shown in public video footage were taken by the officer,” Levine Cava said on Instagram.

“We will continue to keep our community informed about this process and findings will be made available – critical to maintaining the public trust that MDPD has earned with our community. I look forward to learning more from the internal review process and to updating the public as the review concludes.”"
sport,Tyreek Hill: What we know about Miami Dolphins star’s detainment by police,2024-09-10,"George Ramsay, Ben Morse, Wayne Sterling, David Close, Kevin Dotson, Homero De La Fuente","It’s been an eventful few days for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill, who was handcuffed and detained by Miami-Dade Police shortly before his team’s opening game Sunday.

The detention, for what his agent called a moving violation, was just temporary, and Hill later scored a stellar 80-yard touchdown in a close win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He celebrated the score by putting his arms behind his back with his wrists together – a cheeky nod to his pregame incident.

But off the field, the detention has led to a public back-and-forth between the Dolphins and police and has renewed the debate over how law enforcement handles traffic stops and interacts with members of the public.

On Monday night, police released nearly two hours of body-camera footage showing the interaction with Hill and other Dolphins players at the scene. A police union criticized Hill as “uncooperative.”

In turn, the Dolphins organization released a statement criticizing the officers’ conduct, and Hill told CNN he remained confused by the encounter.

“I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it,” Hill said. “I’m embarrassed.”

Here’s what we know about Hill’s detention before the game on Sunday and its aftermath.

The Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) released body-worn camera footage from the incident unexpectedly on Monday night.

“While standard protocol is to release bodycam footage after the internal review has concluded, the available bodycam footage – a combined 105 minutes 33 seconds – is being released the day following the incident to reinforce the Department’s commitment to keeping the public informed,” Director Stephanie V. Daniels of the police department said in a statement.

The footage shows a police officer approaching Hill’s car and knocking on the window after he signaled for Hill to pull over. Hill rolls down the window when the officer knocks and replies, “Hey, don’t knock on my window like that.” The officer asks Hill why he doesn’t have a seatbelt on. Hill doesn’t answer and repeatedly says, “Don’t knock on my window like that.”

The officer asks why Hill had his window up and says he had to knock to let Hill know he was there.

“Give me my ticket bro so I can go, I’m going to be late. Do what you got to do,” Hill said before rolling up the window.

The officer tells him to keep his window down and knocks again, but Hill doesn’t appear to respond. The officer knocks again and tells Hill to keep his window down. Hill rolls down his window slightly and responds, “Don’t tell me what to do.”

The officer threatens to make Hill get out of the car if he doesn’t keep the window down, and then immediately after orders him out. Another officer opens Hill’s car door and starts to pull him out of the car, saying, “Get out!” while Hill responds, “I’m getting out.”

Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting out, I’m getting out,” and the same officer says, “Too late.”

Two officers are seen pushing Hill to the ground while another officer stands over. Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting arrested” multiple times, and the one officer physically restraining him says, “When we tell you to do something, you do it. You understand? You understand? Not what you want, but what we tell you. You’re a little f**cking confused.”

“Alright bro, take me to jail, bro do what you gotta do,” Hill says. “We will,” the officer responds.

The time from when the officer first knocks on Hill’s window to when he is fully handcuffed on the ground is around a minute and a half. The officers then move Hill to his feet and have him sit on the sidewalk. As an officer slowly leads him to sit on the ground, Hill says “Hold on, bro. I just had surgery on my knee.” As he is speaking, another officer comes behind him and puts an arm around his chest. He begins to pull Hill toward the ground as Hill repeats, “I just had surgery on my knee.”

The restraining officer says, “Really, what a coincidence. Did you have surgery on your ears when we told you to put the window down?”

“Bro, chill!” Hill yells.

Hill tells CNN he’s still in shock

Hill spoke with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Monday, saying everything happened very fast.

“I was following rules, I wasn’t moving fast because you know I got injuries, I got things that I go through. I play a physical sport, I’ve been doing this for a moment now man so I’m dealing with some stuff, so I guess the officers, they felt like I wasn’t doing it on their timing. I was doing it, but I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it,” Hill said. “I’m embarrassed.”

Hill further reflected on the moment that things escalated, saying that it started when officers asked him to roll down his window.

“When the officer came up and knocked on my window, I let my window down, cooperated, gave them my I.D. Then I immediately let up my window, and then after that I let back up my window, and then he came back to the window and was like, ‘Let your window down now, let your window down now’ and then I let it down,” Hill said.

“I’m not trying to cause a scene because … if I let my window down, people walking by, driving by, they’re going to notice that it’s me and they’re going to start taking pictures. I didn’t want to create a scene at all, I just really wanted to get the ticket and then just go out about my way and have a great Sunday.”

The 30-year-old was asked about an earlier quote of his about how the situation could’ve unfolded differently if he wasn’t Tyreek Hill.

“The reality of it is, it’s the truth. If I wasn’t Tyreek Hill, worst-case scenario, we would’ve had a different article. ‘Tyreek Hill got shot in front of Hard Rock Stadium,’ that’s worst-case scenario,” Hill said. “It’s crazy that me and my family had to go through this.”

A second Dolphins player, Calais Campbell, was also handcuffed when trying to discuss the situation with officers at the scene, according to police.

Speaking to ESPN on Monday, the 38-year-old defensive lineman recalled how he arrived at the scene of his teammate’s detention and attempted to diffuse the situation. He said he got out of his car with his hands up and approached the police officers, explaining, “I’m a friend of his (Hill). I don’t know what’s going on here, but I think the situation is definitely unnecessary.”

Campbell said he was told to leave, with an officer threatening to tow his car if he didn’t go away.

“I told him I will stand where you want me to stand. You tell me how far I need to back up, and I’ll back up, but I’m not leaving the scene,” Campbell recounted. “This is my friend here. I’m here to support him. I’m not leaving.”

When he remained, Campbell said the officer told him he was under arrest and put him in handcuffs.

Campbell said Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith was also at the scene as Hill pleaded with both teammates: “Don’t leave me. Don’t leave me.”

Now in his 17th season, Campbell has previously won the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award, given annually to a player “for his excellence on and off the field.” This is his first season with the Dolphins.

Campbell told ESPN he was thankful he was there to support Hill.

“These situations can escalate quickly. We see it so many times in America where these things go completely bad. This is a big opportunity for us to use this platform to combat police brutality that happens. This situation could have been a whole lot worse had we not been there.”

Dolphins organization slams police conduct

After the bodycam footage was released, the Miami Dolphins released a three-paragraph statement criticizing the “the overly aggressive and violent conduct directed towards Tyreek Hill, Calais Campbell and Jonnu Smith by police officers.”

“It is both maddening and heartbreaking to watch the very people we trust to protect our community use such unnecessary force and hostility towards these players, yet it is also a reminder that not every situation like this ends in peace, as we are grateful this one did,” the team said.

The team said they have a positive relationship with the police and praised the “vast majority of officers.”

“However, as is on full display in the videos released tonight, there are some officers who mistake their responsibility and commitment to serve with misguided power,” the team said. “While we commend MDPD for taking the right and necessary action to quickly release this footage, we also urge them to take equally swift and strong action against the officers who engaged in such despicable behavior.”

sport,Deshaun Watson: Cleveland Browns quarterback accused of 2020 sexual assault in new lawsuit,2024-09-10,"Ben Church, Wayne Sterling","Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has been accused of sexual assault and battery which allegedly occurred in 2020, according to a civil lawsuit filed Monday by a woman in Harris County, Texas.

In the lawsuit obtained by CNN, a woman identified as “Jane Doe” claims that Watson sexually assaulted her in her apartment before a dinner date in October 2020.

According to the lawsuit, Watson – who was playing for the Houston Texans at the time – had become angry when he initially couldn’t find the woman’s apartment, yelling at her on the phone.

When inside, as the woman was getting ready in the bathroom, Watson allegedly took off his clothes and demanded a massage to his buttocks while lying on her bed.

According to the filing, the woman, Jane Doe, said she was terrified.

“She was in her small apartment with a much larger man. … Doe thus tried to appease Watson by rubbing his back, rather than his buttocks,” the suit reads.

Watson insisted she massage his buttocks, but she refused, and he became frustrated, according to the suit.

“Jane froze in fear, unsure of how to refuse Watson’s advances without jeopardizing her safety,” the suit alleges.

According to the lawsuit, Watson disrobed the woman and “penetrated her … without consent, implicit or explicit.”

The suit alleges: “Jane Doe felt paralyzed, unsure if she should risk her safety by trying to stop Watson or endure his assault.”

The sexual assault allegedly lasted for “several minutes” before the woman broke free and grabbed a heavy object for protection, the suit adds. The lawsuit claims Watson then “stormed out” of the apartment.

Neither Watson’s legal representatives, the Browns, the Texans nor the NFL Players Association have responded to CNN’s request for comment.

The NFL declined to comment when contacted by CNN.

Jane Doe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $1 million, the lawsuit states.

In 2022, the NFL and the NFLPA agreed to suspend Watson for 11 regular season games without pay and fine him $5 million after at least 24 civil lawsuits were filed on behalf of women alleging the quarterback sexually harassed or assaulted them during private massage appointments while he was playing for the Texans.

Watson repeatedly denied wrongdoing in those cases, and 23 of the lawsuits were settled confidentially. Two grand juries declined to charge Watson criminally.

“I’m moving on with my career and my life, and I’m going to continue to stand on my innocence,” Watson said at the time.

“Just because settlements and things like that happen, doesn’t mean that person is guilty for anything,” he said.

In 2022, the Browns traded three first-round picks for Watson and then signed him to a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history at the time."

sport,NFL Week 1 takeaways: Are the Dallas Cowboys for real?,2024-09-10,Ben Morse,"There are 17 weeks of the 2024 NFL regular season remaining, but there are some things we can learn from Week 1 of the new campaign.

A few of the favorites had strong starts and several of the teams who had been hoping for improvement struggled.

Here are the main takeaways from Week 1.

The Dallas Cowboys look like contenders

The Dallas Cowboys under head coach Mike McCarthy have been regular season juggernauts without much playoff success to show for it.

‘America’s Team’ has suffered consecutive humiliating postseason defeats under McCarthy, ramping up the pressure on the 60-year-old ahead of the new season.

That spotlight only intensified with a contract holdout involving star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and questions over quarterback Dak Prescott’s future.

But those issues were resolved – Lamb signed a new contract two weeks before the regular season kicked off while Prescott agreed to his new extension, becoming the highest-paid player in NFL history, just hours before Week 1 began.

And Dallas played like a team freed from the weight of pressure against the Cleveland Browns in their season-opener, romping to a comfortable 33-17 victory where every facet of the team shined.

Prescott, Lamb and the rest of the offense moved the ball proficiently against a stacked Browns defense, Micah Parsons and his defensive teammates wreaked havoc while kicker Brandon Aubrey is slowly cementing himself as the heir-apparent to the Baltimore Ravens’ Justin Tucker as the league’s best kicker.

They even got a punt-return touchdown early in the third quarter from KaVontae Turpin as the icing on the cake in Ohio.

All-in-all, it was an impressive performance which begins laying the foundation for the Cowboys’ Super Bowl aspirations after a turbulent offseason.

There are still plenty of hurdles for the team to overcome, with the ever-watching eyes of owner Jerry Jones resting on McCarthy, but it was the perfect start for Dallas as it seeks to win its first Lombardi Trophy since 1996.

The AFC South has an exciting future

For years, the AFC South has struggled for relevancy, but that might all be about to change.

Sunday’s Week 1 clash between the Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts offered an insight into what could come for the division with both teams boasting young, exciting second-year quarterbacks, each with a promising future.

Houston’s CJ Stroud enjoyed a historic rookie season last time out, while Indianapolis’ Anthony Richardson showed glimpses of brilliance as he battled injuries.

When the two faced off in Lucas Oil Stadium, they showed why they were so highly sought after in the 2023 Draft – Stroud went No. 2 overall while Richardson got selected two picks later.

Stroud missed just eight throws all afternoon, racking up a 115.9 QB rating as he threw for 234 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, in an almost flawless performance to begin his second season with a bang.

Richardson, on the other hand, showed some of the inexperience he still possesses – he only had 13 career college starts and played in just four games last year – but also why he is being tipped for future stardom.

The 22-year-old only completed nine passes and had a head-scratching interception but also had some of the most impressive throws of Week 1, most notably two long touchdown passes – one for 60 yards which set social media alight and another for 54 yards. The young Colts signal-caller also ran for another score.

After the defeat, Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen was full of praise for Richardson, saying there’s “not many guys” who can produce what he can.

“”I thought he made some big-time plays for us,” Steichen told reporters, per the Colts website. “Obviously, that opening touchdown pass to Alec (Pierce), I don’t think I’ve seen a throw like that.

“And then he hit another big one to Alec right there at the end on the two-minute drive, to get down there and score. He had Ashton on the in-cut. Then fourth down, got to have it. I mean, he just powered his will to go get in. I thought he did some really good things coming back.”

The pairing of Stroud and Richardson could set the AFC South up nicely for years to come with some titanic battles on the horizon. And with former No. 1 overall pick Trevor Lawrence in Jacksonville, it’s anyone’s guess which team has the brightest future.

Another long season ahead in Carolina

After a 2-15 season last year, 2024 was meant to be a new era of hope for the Carolina Panthers.

However, things got off to the worst possible start in Week 1 with a humbling 47-10 defeat at the hands of the New Orleans Saints.

Last year’s No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young – who Carolina acquired by trading wide receiver DJ Moore and multiple first round picks – looked lost, despite a new head coach calling his plays.

Dave Canales was appointed in the offseason after rejuvenating the careers of Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield in Seattle and Tampa Bay respectively with the hopes he could have a similar impact on Young.

But the early signs were worrying for Young and Canales against the Saints, with the quarterback throwing an interception on his first play and another at the start of the second half. The 23-year-old looked overwhelmed throughout the game and, with New Orleans holding a huge lead in the second half, was benched for veteran Andy Dalton to prevent any further damage.

And if things couldn’t get any worse for the Panthers, news came out on Monday that arguably the team’s best player, defensive tackle Derrick Brown, could miss the remainder of the season after suffering a meniscus injury in the loss to the Saints.

“Definitely a huge loss,” Canales said, per the NFL. “He’s one of our best players. That’s big shoes to fill.”

The Panthers traded for the first pick of the 2022 Draft to acquire Young, earned last season’s top pick – which had been traded to the Bears in the deal for the second-year QB – and could be in line for the 2025 NFL Draft’s No. 1 pick if the season doesn’t improve quickly.

And if things couldn’t get any worse for the Panthers, news came out on Monday that arguably the team’s best player, defensive tackle Derrick Brown, could miss the remainder of the season after suffering a meniscus injury in the loss to the Saints.

“Definitely a huge loss,” Canales said, per the NFL. “He’s one of our best players. That’s big shoes to fill.”

The Panthers traded for the first pick of the 2022 Draft to acquire Young, earned last season’s top pick – which had been traded to the Bears in the deal for the second-year QB – and could be in line for the 2025 NFL Draft’s No. 1 pick if the season doesn’t improve quickly.

sport,Adrian Newey joins Aston Martin after 19 years with Red Bull,2024-09-10,"Jamie Barton, Amanda Davies","Aston Martin has won the race to sign Adrian Newey, widely regarded as the greatest Formula One designer of all time.

The 65-year-old has signed a long-term contract with the British team and will join as Managing Technical Partner in March 2025 after nearly 20 years with Red Bull. The deal represents a statement of intent from Aston Martin executive chairman and part-owner Lawrence Stroll.

“I felt as if I needed a new challenge,” Newey said in a press conference at the Aston Martin factory in Silverstone. “I was very flattered to have a lot of approaches from various teams, but Lawrence’s passion, commitment and enthusiasm was very endearing, very persuasive.

“In this modern era, Lawrence is actually unique in being the only properly active team owner,” he continued. “It’s a different feeling when you have somebody like Lawrence involved like that. It’s back to the old-school model.”

Across stints with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull, Newey has heavily contributed to 12 drivers’ and 13 constructors’ championships, overseeing periods of dominance for the likes of Mika Häkkinen, Sebastian Vettel and, most recently, Max Verstappen.

In particular, the designer has proved himself a master at capitalizing on changes in regulations – likely a key factor in Stroll’s decision to bring him in ahead of new F1 rules debuting in 2026.

“It’s a great day for Aston Martin,” Stroll told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies. “Everybody wants Adrian. There’s nobody quite like him in the sport, based on all his successes.

“I think when Adrian saw my passion, my commitment, our intent as a company, he believed, ‘You guys will be the next.’ And he believed he could bring some very significant added value on being part of bringing us to those World Championships that we’re looking forward to.”

The F1 outfit will be hoping for a significant upturn in form upon Newey’s arrival. The team currently sits fifth in the constructors’ championship standings, having failed to achieve a podium finish so far this season.

Neither of Aston Martin’s drivers have made it onto the podium yet this year, with Fernando Alonso currently 10th in the driver standings and Lance Stroll, the son of the team’s part-owner Lawrence, 11th."

sport,Police release video of NFL star Tyreek Hill being detained after traffic stop on the way to the stadium,2024-09-09,"Sara Sidner, David Close, Ben Morse, Wayne Sterling","Miami-Dade police on Monday released body camera footage of officers detaining Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill in the hours before the wide receiver played in Sunday’s opening game of the season.

CNN is reviewing the video of the four officers responding to a traffic stop. One shows the initial contact with an officer knocking on the driver’s side window of Hill’s sportscar after signaling for the wide receiver to pull over near the Dolphins’ stadium. Hill rolls down the window when the officer knocks and replies, “Hey, don’t knock on my window like that.”

The officer asks Hill why he doesn’t have a seatbelt on. Hill doesn’t answer and repeatedly says, “Don’t knock on my window like that.”

The officer asks why Hill had his window up and says he had to knock to let Hill know he was there.

“Give me my ticket, bro so I can go, I’m going to be late. Do what you got to do,” Hill says before rolling up the window.

The officer tells him to keep his window down and knocks again, but Hill doesn’t appear to respond. The officer knocks again and tells Hill to keep his window down. Hill rolls down his window slightly and responds, “Don’t tell me what to do.”

The officer threatens to make Hill get out of the car if he doesn’t keep the window down, and then immediately after orders him out.

Another officer opens Hill’s car door and starts to pull him out of the car, saying, “Get out!” while Hill responds, “I’m getting out.”

Two officers are seen pushing Hill to the ground while another officer stands over. Hill is heard saying “I’m getting arrested” multiple times, and the one officer physically restraining him says, “When we tell you to do something, you do it. You understand? You understand? Not what you want, but what we tell you. You’re a little f**cking confused.”

Hill is heard saying, “I’m getting out, I’m getting out,” and the same officer says, “Too late.”

While Hill is sitting on the sidewalk, the officer who originally tapped on the window is told by another officer that Hill is “the Dolphins’ star player.” After a discussion with police, Hill is given citations and allowed to leave.

Hill told “The Source with Kaitlan Collins” on Monday he was still shell-shocked by the encounter.

“I was shocked. It was crazy because it all happened so fast. … I really couldn’t like gather everything that was happening,” he said. “I wasn’t moving fast because you know I got injuries. I got things that I go through. I play a physical sport. … I guess the officers – they felt like I wasn’t doing it on their timing. But I was doing it. I’m still kind of shell-shocked from it.”

Hill said he just wanted to get his ticket and was afraid the stop would cause a scene when passersby recognized the NFL star.

NFL star Tyreek Hill speaks out after police release bodycam video of his detention before the Miami Dolphin’s season-opener.



Watch what he tells @kaitlancollins: pic.twitter.com/uir8G84NTP — TheSourceCNN (@TheSourceCNN) September 10, 2024

Police released more than an hour-and-a-half’s worth of body camera footage from officers on Monday night, despite saying earlier in the day that the video would not be released until after an internal investigation was completed.

“While standard protocol is to release body cam footage after the internal review has concluded, the available body cam footage – a combined 105 minutes 33 seconds – is being released the day following the incident to reinforce the Department’s commitment to keeping the public informed,” Director Stephanie V. Daniels of the police department said in a statement.

Agent: Officers’ actions were uncalled for

Hill’s agent called the Miami Dolphins star’s detention “heartbreaking, upsetting and uncalled for” in an interview with CNN earlier on Monday as the local police union began to defend the officers involved.

Speaking to CNN’s Sara Sidner, Drew Rosenhaus said he was “in disbelief” about what took place after he was pulled over for a moving violation.

“Tyreek was just trying to get to work, trying to play a game, just trying to do his job,” Rosenhaus said on “CNN News Central.” “For police officers to detain him, to put him on the ground like that, to put their knee on him, to hit him – it’s just devastating.”

Daniels said on Sunday that an investigation has begun into the incident and that one of the officers involved is being placed on administrative duties. Police confirmed to CNN that a second Dolphins player, Calais Campbell, was also handcuffed when trying to discuss the situation with officers at the scene.

On Monday, the South Florida Police Benevolent Association defended the actions of the officers involved, highlighting that Hill was never placed under arrest.

“Upon being stopped, Mr. Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr. Hill in handcuffs,” Steadman Stahl, the organization’s president, said in a statement to CNN.

“Mr. Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground. Once the situation was sorted out within a few minutes, Mr. Hill was issued two traffic citations and was free to leave.

“In this case, while we will wait for the investigation to run its course, based on what we know, we stand with the actions of our officers but look forward to further open communication moving forward,” Stahl added.

The Dolphins on Monday called the officers’ conduct toward Hill and two other players who stopped at the scene overly aggressive and violent. They urged the police department to take action against the officers for their “despicable behavior.”

“It is both maddening and heartbreaking to watch the very people we trust to protect our community use such unnecessary force and hostility towards these players, yet it is also a reminder that not every situation like this ends in peace, as we are grateful this one did,” team officials said.

Attorney says Hill considering legal action

“I think the video contradicts everything they are saying,” Julius B. Collins, an attorney for the wide receiver told CNN. Earlier in a written statement he called the officers’ actions excessive, adding his team is exploring all legal remedies.

“Mr. Hill understands the inherently dangerous job that law enforcement is tasked with and understands that officer safety is important; however, at no point in time did Mr. Hill pose a threat to these officers,” Collins said Monday. “We believe that this matter was escalated due to overzealous officers attempting to impose their authority on Mr. Hill because they were not pleased with how fast he complied with their request and that Mr. Hill did not roll down his window far enough to their liking.”

Collins said Hill, a five-time All-Pro who is in his third season with the Dolphins, is appreciative of his celebrity status but “it is not lost upon him how so many others in similar situations have met a different fate. and how fortunate all parties involved were able to walk away from this matter.”

Hill scored an 80-yard touchdown in Miami’s 20-17 victory against the Jaguars, celebrating by putting his arms behind his back with his wrists together – perhaps alluding to being in handcuffs earlier Sunday.

Rosenhaus said he believed the celebration was a way of Hill “coping” with the incident.

“It’s just embarrassing for images where you’re in handcuffs and you’re on the ground with police (having) their knee on you, pushing you and treating you like the criminal,” he said. “Absolutely believe that celebration was his way of coping with something that was so upsetting.”

Rosenhaus added: “To Tyreek’s credit, it was remarkable that he was able to compose himself. He was able to go and play the game, making a sensational play, an 80-yard touchdown to help the team win, come from behind. His performance was epic.

“But what happened before the game was disgraceful, unacceptable and cannot happen in this society. Who would have thought after George Floyd that we would still see people treated like this unfairly and unnecessarily?”

Hill said after Sunday’s game that he was still confused by his pregame encounter with police.

“I wasn’t disrespectful because my mom didn’t raise me that way, didn’t cuss, didn’t do none of that. Like I said, I’m still trying to figure it out,” Hill said at his postgame press conference.

Rosenhaus told CNN Monday that there is “no question” that there will be “ramifications” to come out of the incident involving Hill.

“If Tyreek wasn’t a world-class athlete and in incredible shape, who knows how this could have impacted him,” he said. “He was sore. He was hurting. He was physically and mentally distraught – something where we’re seeking answers – and we will pursue this to the fullest extent of the law.”

Campbell describes tense detention scene

On Monday, Campbell recalled how he arrived at the scene of his teammate’s detention and attempted to diffuse the situation.

Speaking on ESPN, the 17-year NFL veteran said he got out of his car with his hands up and approached the police officers, saying, “I’m a friend of his (Hill). I don’t know what’s going on here, but I think the situation is definitely unnecessary.”

Campbell said he was told to leave, with an officer threatening to tow his car if he didn’t go away.

“I told him I will stand where you want me to stand. You tell me how far I need to back up, and I’ll back up, but I’m not leaving the scene,” Campbell recounted. “This is my friend here. I’m here to support him. I’m not leaving.”

Body camera footage released Monday shows Campbell approaching police with his hands up, asking what is going on. “I just want to know what’s going on,” he says. The officer responds “It’s not your business. It’s not your business, keep going back.” The officer tells him to back up behind a car and Campbell moves.

After not vacating, Campbell, in his first season with the Dolphins, said the officer told him he was under arrest and put Campbell in handcuffs. Body camera footage shows him being handcuffed.

The defensive tackle said Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith was also at the scene as Hill pleaded with both teammates: “Don’t leave me. Don’t leave me.”

Campbell told ESPN he was thankful he was there to support Hill.

“These situations can escalate quickly. We see it so many times in America where these things go completely bad. This is a big opportunity for us to use this platform to combat police brutality that happens. This situation could have been a whole lot worse had we not been there.”

After being released by police, Campbell said Hill was “frustrated and flustered” and told others he wouldn’t play against the Jaguars.

The Dolphins are back in action on Thursday when they face their divisional rivals, the Buffalo Bills, at Hard Rock Stadium.

sport,Shohei Ohtani moves closer to 50-50 season with 47th steal in Los Angeles Dodgers’ 10-4 loss to Chicago Cubs,2024-09-10,Jamie Barton,"Shohei Ohtani stole his 47th base of the season on Monday night to take him one step closer to a historic 50-50 season as the Los Angeles Dodgers lost 10-4 to the Chicago Cubs.

Having racked up his 46th home run of the campaign on Sunday, the two-time AL MVP is now just three steals and four homers away from becoming the first player in MLB history to register 50 of each in a single season.

Ohtani has found new ways to impress since he was ruled out of pitching until 2025. His steal on Monday means he is now just five more stolen bases away from doubling his previous best tally: the 26 he managed in 2021.

The Japanese star has not slowed down since joining the 40-40 club in August, where his name sits alongside Alfonso Soriano, Jose Canseco, Ronald Acuña Jr., Barry Bonds, and previous all-time record holder Alex Rodriguez, who managed 43-43 while with the Seattle Mariners in 1998.

Despite moving closer to making history, Ohtani was not the only storyline on Monday night. In fact, it was the performances of two former Dodgers, Cody Bellinger and Michael Busch, which decided the game.

The Cubs wasted no time, opening up a three-run lead in the top of the first when Bellinger hit a two-run homer off the first pitch he faced, while Busch followed up shortly after with an RBI single to right field.

With Cubs pitcher Kyle Hendricks keen to avoid Ohtani’s 47th home run of the season, he walked the Japanese star in the bottom of the third, and Ohtani promptly stole second with ease.

But Busch would come to Hendricks’ aid at the bottom of the third, catching Max Muncy’s line drive to first to end the inning with the bases loaded, before hitting a solo homer in the top of the fourth, extending the Cubs’ lead to four.

After the Dodgers halved the deficit in the fifth, the Cubs responded an inning later when Busch’s RBI single brought home Bellinger, and catcher Miguel Amaya batted in two more.

An impressive return to LA for Bellinger was completed with an RBI single in the top of the ninth, followed by an excellent diving catch to kick off the bottom.

Ohtani has 18 regular-season games remaining to pick up the three steals and four home runs needed to hit the 50-50 mark, starting with another game against the Cubs on Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium."

The 37-year-old claimed the top spot in the latest women’s rankings released by the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) – the governing body of breaking and other dancesports.

Raygun’s performances failed to score any points across her Olympic battles against breakers from the United States, France and Lithuania in August, losing 18-0 in all three rounds.

However, she won the gold medal at the 2023 WDSF Oceania Championships, securing her 1,000 ranking points and vaulting her up to No. 1 – level on points with world No. 2 B-Girl Riko of Japan – ahead of the breakers who defeated her in the French capital. Her victory at the Oceania Championships also secured her a spot in Paris.

In an odd twist, none of the Olympic B-Girl medalists are ranked inside the top 10. Japan’s Ami, Lithuania’s Nicka and China’s 671 earned gold, silver and bronze respectively.

In a statement, the WDSF on Tuesday clarified that its rankings are updated based on each athlete’s top four performances within the past 12 months. Points earned in these competitions remain valid for 52 weeks from the date of the event.

The governing body also confirmed that the Olympic qualifying events in Shanghai and Budapest, as well as the Paris Games themselves, did not contribute to the ranking list due to limited athlete quotas. Additionally, WDSF said that events which traditionally give ranking points were not held to allow competitors to fully focus on preparation for the Games.

“In alignment with the Olympic Qualification System, ranking events were intentionally not held between 31 December 2023 and the Olympic Games Paris 2024. This strategic scheduling allowed athletes to focus solely on the last part of their Olympic qualification without the added pressure of additional ranking events.

“By the end of the Olympic Games, many of the competition results included in the ranking had expired, leading to the current situation where many athletes have only one competition result contributing to their ranking.”

It added that the current rankings should be looked at “in conjunction” with more recent results and that the list will change when the next batch of 12-month points expire and the Breaking for Gold World Series is held in Shanghai in October.

Raygun shot to fame after her unique routine at the Olympics drew the world’s attention.

Dressed in the green and gold tracksuit of Australia, she displayed some unorthodox moves, including a kangaroo hop, a backward roll and various contortions with her body while lying or crawling on the floor.

She received criticism online for her performance, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling her routines “hilariously ridiculous,” and another questioning how she had made it this far.

Celebrities took notice as well – singer Adele took time out of her concert in Munich to ask whether the whole thing was a “joke,” while actress Rachel Dratch imitated some of the moves on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”

Raygun – who is a university lecturer by day – recently apologized to the breaking community, saying that she was “very sorry for the backlash that the community has experienced” after her performance. She has been defended by some within the sport.

“It’s all about originality and it’s all about bringing something new to the table and representing your country or region,” said Martin Gilian, the chief breaking judge at the Olympics, also known as MGbility.

“She created some original moves which could be maybe funny or entertaining for others, but for us, she basically represented breaking and hip hop. She was trying to be original and bring something new to the table. From our perspective, that was nothing really shocking.”

Raygun described the online reaction as “devastating” but has remained upbeat about the entire experience.

“I knew that I was going to get beaten, and I knew that people were not going to understand my style and what I was going to do,” she said in an interview with Australian current affairs show The Project. “The odds were against me, that’s for sure.”

“I would much rather focus on the positives out of this, and the positive responses and the joy that I brought people,” she said. “It’s going out there and just having fun and going as hard as you can in the face of, you know, losing.”

sport,49ers. vs. Jets: San Francisco spoils Aaron Rodgers’ return to NFL action with dominant win over New York,2024-09-10,Ben Morse,"The San Francisco 49ers put in a dominant showing to beat the New York Jets 32-19 on Monday, spoiling Aaron Rodgers’ return to NFL action.

San Francisco running back Jordan Mason was the star of the show, getting the start in the absence of Christian McCaffrey, the reigning Offensive Player of the Year who was out with a calf injury.

Mason enjoyed a career performance, totaling 147 rushing yards on 28 carries, including a five-yard touchdown at the start of the second half. Niners kicker Jake Moody also added six field goals.

After the game, 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy heralded Mason’s impact in the Week 1 victory.

“So obviously,” Purdy told reporters, “Christian [McCaffrey] is the best in the league at running back and what he does, I’m not taking anything away from that, but I think JP did a good job of coming in and filling his void and doing his job to allow other guys to get open and allow us to run our offense.”

The game was Rodgers’ return to the NFL having missed most of last year after suffering a torn Achilles on the fourth snap of the Jets’ 2023 season opener.

The fourth snap of this year’s campaign had ominous tones too for New York when the team’s running back Breece Hall had the ball punched out of his hands by Niners linebacker Fred Warner, with the resulting fumble recovered by San Francisco.

Despite the poor start, Rodgers soon showed why the Jets traded for him ahead of last season. Near the end of the first quarter, the 40-year-old was vital in orchestrating a 14-play, 70-yard drive, culminating with a three-yard Hall touchdown run.

However, the Jets offense then struggled to produce much until late in the third by which point San Francisco had built up a comfortable lead. Per the NFL, the Jets only had 21:20 minutes of possession, the lowest mark of Rodgers’ career.

Rodgers – who threw 13-of-21 for 167 yards, a touchdown pass and an interception – reflected on his return to action by saying: “I can play better.”

“I missed a couple of throws, I missed the one to Garrett [Wilson] on the last drive I was in. The pick, I missed just slightly inside on that one,” the former Green Bay Packers quarterback said, per the Jets website. “I felt overall I was getting the ball out pretty good, but we had some opportunities that I’d like to have back.”

“We were just bad on first and second down for a lot of the game,” Rodgers said. “Then we had a couple of drives where we converted third downs. I felt like we didn’t have any third-and-10-plusses tonight. But we didn’t convert those third-and-mediums. We had a drop, a couple of penalties, bad throw. There’s a lot to correct.”

The 49ers totaled 401 yards on offense, even with McCaffrey missing as head coach Kyle Shanahan’s team got off to a promising start to the 2024 season after suffering heartbreak in February in a 25-22 overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII.

It was a quiet night for 49ers receiver Brandon Aiyuk, who signed a big-money extension in the offseason, finishing with two catches for 28 yards, but it didn’t matter much on a night where a lot went right for San Francisco."
sport,Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau tearfully remembered at joint funeral,2024-09-09,David Close,"The lives of Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau were remembered at an emotional, joint memorial service at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Media, PA, on Monday.

Many NHL players, including Sean Monahan, Kevin Hayes, Seth Jones, Cole Caufield, Jack Eichel, and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, were in attendance to commemorate and honor the two late hockey players.

The brothers’ caskets, draped in matching white cloths with golden crosses, were placed head-to-head at the base of the lectern and in front of the mourners within the church.

The pair were killed on August 29 after being struck by a suspected drunken driver while riding bikes on a New Jersey roadway, just hours before they were to serve as groomsmen at their sister’s wedding in Philadelphia.

Matthew and Johnny’s wives spoke at the service.

Matthew Gaudreau’s widow, Madeline, said through tears that she felt she was “trapped in a nightmare” she couldn’t wake from this past week. “I feel numb, angry, sad, blessed all at once.”

Madeline is pregnant with the couple’s first child.

During her eulogy, Johnny Gaudreau’s widow Meredith revealed she was in her ninth week of pregnancy with the couple’s third child.

“In less than three years of marriage, we’ve created a family of five. It doesn’t even sound possible. But I look at it as the ultimate blessing.

“How lucky am I to be the mother of John’s three babies?

“Our last one being a blessing and so special despite these difficult circumstances,” she said.

Johnny Gaudreau, 31, starred in the NHL for 11 seasons with the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets – scoring 243 career goals and amassing 743 points while making seven All-Star game appearances.

“Despite losing my husband way too soon, I still feel like the luckiest girl in the world to be his wife,” she said.

Meredith thanked those who were with Johnny while he played in Calgary for ten years. “He is forever a Flame, and I am so proud of that. I am so proud to call Calgary my home away from home as well.”

She got especially emotional when talking about the city her husband chose to play starting in 2022.

“To Columbus and our Blue Jackets family. I can’t describe how shattered I am that I don’t get more time in your amazing city with John.”

She recounted how the couple’s two children were born while her husband played in the city.

“The memories we made in Columbus as a growing family are the best years of my life.”

While speaking to her late husband, Meredith said, “I miss you so much, and I love you. You are my forever, and I cannot wait until we are all together again. Please watch over us.”

The brothers starred on the ice at Boston College, playing together during the 2013-14 season.

Pastor Tony Penna, who is the associate vice president and director of campus ministry at Boston College, addressed the congregation during the service, noting the brothers’ strong parental foundation.

“They went to the right school. Not Gloucester Catholic High School or B.C. They went to the Gaudreau School.”

Those in attendance laughed.

Fr. Penna continued, “That’s true.

“They had the best teachers. They had the best professors - Guy and Jane (Johnny and Matthew’s parents). ‘Cause they taught their kids how to love.”

The service was live-streamed on the Blue Jackets website."
sport,Nations League Sunday review: Cristiano Ronaldo scores 901st career goal to rescue Portugal,2024-09-09,Ben Morse,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 901st career goal on Sunday as he rescued a 2-1 victory for Portugal against Scotland in the UEFA Nations League.

The 39-year-old tapped home from close range in the 88th minute to complete Portugal’s comeback having gone a goal behind in Lisbon.

Scott McTominay’s powerful header in the seventh minute had given Scotland a surprise lead and despite consistent pressure, Portugal struggled to find an equalizer.

That was until Bruno Fernandes fired home from the edge of the area to level the scores in the 54th minute.

Portugal pushed for a winner, with Ronaldo striking the post and Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn twice denying João Félix with superb saves.

And just when it looked like both teams would have to settle for a draw, Ronaldo popped up at the back post to convert a dangerous cross from left-back Nuno Mendes.

It was his second goal in as many games during this international break, having scored his 900th career goal on Thursday against Croatia. It was also his 132nd goal for Portugal, on top of 450 for Real Madrid, 145 for Manchester United, 101 for Juventus, 68 for Al Nassr and five for Sporting Lisbon.

Afterwards, Fernandes – who was playing in his 600th career game – expressed how important Ronaldo was to the Portugal team.

“The influence is always the same, regardless of whether he starts on the bench or not,” Fernandes said, per Reuters.

“Everyone who came on made the difference. Cristiano has a goal, today he scored 901 and now he’s on his way to a thousand, which is what he wants.”

Ronaldo’s winner means Portugal has a perfect start to its Nations League campaign, now with six points to lead League A Group 1.

Croatia sits in second on three points following its 1-0 victory against Poland on Sunday.

Elsewhere, Spain continued its strong 2024 with a 4-1 victory over Switzerland.

The European champion took an early lead through Joselu before Fabián Ruiz doubled its advantage just minutes later.

But in the 20th minute, Spain was reduced to 10-men when Robin Le Normand was shown a straight red card.

Zeki Amdouni halved the deficit shortly after halftime but Ruiz’s second of the game reestablished Spain’s two-goal lead before Ferran Torres’ late strike sealed all three points for La Roja.

sport,Shohei Ohtani ties career-high 46 home runs to move closer to historic 50-50,2024-09-09,Jamie Barton,"Shohei Ohtani continued his pursuit of a historic 50-50 season Sunday, as his 46th home run of the year helped the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 4-0 victory over the Cleveland Guardians.

The two-time AL MVP’s fifth-inning solo shot brought him to 46 on the season, matching his career best for the Los Angeles Angels in 2021. Coupled with his 46 steals so far this campaign, the accomplishment means Ohtani is closer than ever to achieving a historic 50-50 season.

Ohtani joined the esteemed 40-40 club last month, etching his name alongside Alfonso Soriano, Jose Canseco, Ronald Acuña Jr., Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez, which the previous all-time best on a season being A-Rod’s 43-43 in 1998 as a member of the Seattle Mariners.

After the win against Cleveland, Ohtani maintained that he is trying to put the potential 50-50 out of his mind.

“I’m trying to be less cognizant of it,” he said through interpreter Will Ireton, according to MLB.com. “Just more focused on having good feel at the plate, and whenever possible during the game … that’s what I’m trying to do and focus on.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was less reserved. “I think he wants to be the best player that’s ever played this game, and one way to do that is to do something nobody has ever done, which he has already done,” he said, as per MLB.com. “But you also like round numbers.”

Sunday’s 50-50 pursuit did not get off to the best start for Ohtani, as he was picked off at first by Tanner Bibee to end the third inning.

But Ohtani turned it around in the fifth, crushing a 450-foot home run to right field. After a lengthy review to see if the ball was fair, the homer was confirmed and the Dodgers opened up a two-run lead from which the Guardians would not recover.

Ohtani has 19 regular-season games remaining to find the required four home runs and four stolen bases. Doing so would likely break another record: no MLB player has ever won MVP playing exclusively as a Designated Hitter."
sport,Alex Morgan: US soccer legend waves goodbye after playing final minutes of remarkable career,2024-09-09,Ben Church,"US soccer star Alex Morgan waved an emotional goodbye to her professional career on Sunday, playing her final minutes in the San Diego Wave’s 4-1 loss to the North Carolina Courage.

The 35-year-old, who announced her retirement from the sport last week, was substituted in the 13th minute – the number she wore for much of her career – and received a standing ovation from everyone inside the Snapdragon Stadium in southern California.

An emotional Morgan then took off her cleats in the middle of the pitch, before walking off the field in tears.

She then emerged back onto the field after the final whistle to address the thousands of fans who had stayed on.

“I want to thank my teammates, who have constantly challenged me everyday and made me better. I want to thank my family who have relentlessly supported me, sacrificed so much for me,” she said in her farewell speech.

“There have been so many incredible moments in my career, but this one, this last moment I share on the field with you, I will cherish forever. So thank you, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.”

The prolific striker had the opportunity to sign off in style earlier in the match, but saw her penalty in the 10th minute saved by the goalkeeper.

Morgan announced her retirement last week with an emotional four-plus minute video on social media. She also revealed she was pregnant with her second child during the video.

Morgan’s daughter Charlie accompanied her as she walked onto the pitch for the last time and brought a bouquet of flowers onto the field after full-time.

The legendary forward retires having won two-time World Cup titles with the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) and an Olympic gold medal in 2012.

The striker also scored 123 goals for her country – ranking her fifth on the all-time USWNT list."

Lions win overtime thriller against Rams

Sunday Night Football between the Detroit Lions and Los Angeles Rams was one steeped in context; the two teams’ starting quarterbacks – the Lions’ Jared Goff and the Rams’ Matthew Stafford – were traded for one another in 2021.

The two met for the first time since last season’s Wild Card playoff game, with Detroit coming out on top.

And once again, it was Goff and the Lions who had the last laugh on Sunday, as David Montgomery’s one-yard touchdown run in overtime clinched a dramatic 26-20 victory for Detroit.

It was a slow burner at Ford Field, with the Lions leading 10-3 at halftime thanks to Jahmyr Gibbs’ touchdown run. A 52-yard Jameson Williams TD catch from Goff extended Detroit’s lead and it looked like the Lions would run away with the game.

But a second-half comeback from the Rams saw them claw their way back into the game.

First, Kyren Williams ran home from close range near the end of the third and then Stafford connected with Cooper Kupp on a nine-yard throw to give LA a 20-17 lead with 4:30 remaining in the fourth quarter.

Lions kicker Jake Bates tied the game at 20-20 with just seconds remaining, sending the game to overtime.

And having won the OT coinflip, Detroit marched down the field, going 70 yards – 60 of which came on the ground – in four minutes and 41 seconds before Montgomery sealed the win.

According to the NFL, it was Detroit’s first overtime victory since Week 9 in 2016, when Stafford threw a game-winning touchdown to Golden Tate.

For a team that has Super Bowl aspirations, it was an important start to the season for Detroit, which benefited from Williams’ career game: five catches for 121 receiving yards including that long touchdown.

Lions head coach Dan Campbell sung Williams’ praises after the victory.

“Yeah, listen, I expected him to play pretty good, to play better, and he showed up,” Campbell told reporters. “I mean, that was a big game to be able to catch some of these and go through it. And the best part of it was he didn’t even play his best ball.

“There’s still so much to clean up, but it also shows the work that he’s put in, and he is improving, and he’s an improved player, and he wants it, and he keeps working on it. And he just, he keeps taking these steps. So as long as he keeps doing it, and keeps making plays, he’s just going to continue to get better. So yeah, I’m proud of him, I’m proud of where he’s at, but he’s got so much room to continue to grow.”

The loss was made even more painful for Los Angeles as one its star receivers, Puka Nacua, was ruled out of the game at halftime after suffering a knee injury in the second quarter.

Newly-minted Cowboys dominate Browns

After an offseason of questions surrounding the Dallas Cowboys, it has all come together for ‘America’s Team’ with the final piece of the puzzle falling into place hours before a Week 1 clash against the Cleveland Browns.

Just weeks after CeeDee Lamb had signed a massive extension with the team, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott agreed to a record four-year, $240 million contract extension to remain in Texas, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL.

And that money seemed well spent for the Cowboys as both Prescott and Lamb excelled in Dallas’ impressive 33-17 victory over the Browns on Sunday.

Prescott threw for one touchdown, running back Ezekiel Elliot ran for another and kicker Brandon Aubrey had four field goals as the Cowboys claimed the victory in Ohio.

The team’s defense was perhaps the star of the show though, as it intercepted Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson twice and sacked him two times.

Micah Parsons was a menace throughout, consistently taking advantage of Cleveland’s injuries at the tackle position.

“We didn’t open up the full bag,” Parsons said afterwards. “I think the sky’s the limit. This is just the beginning.”

For the Browns, it was a disappointing afternoon where the offense struggled to move the ball. The crowd at Huntington Bank Field expressed its displeasure at Cleveland’s performance with loud boos in the first half.

Watson – who has underwhelmed since his controversial trade in 2022 – threw 24-of-45 for just 169 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions as he was pressured all day.

As another team who has high hopes this season, it was an auspicious opening for Cleveland head coach Kevin Stefanski’s team.

But Watson said he and his Browns teammates cannot lose faith after a disappointing start to the 2024 season.

“We’ve got 16 more opportunities. It’s the NFL, anything can happen. I started 0-4 in 2018. We won 11 straight, so it’s one game at a time,” Watson told reporters. “Take it one week at a time. You get ready, regardless if you win or you lose, you gotta scratch that one and get ready for the next week. So anything can happen.”

The game also saw the commentary debut of NFL legend Tom Brady who was in the Fox booth for the first time in the regular season.

Caleb Williams gets debut victory

It wasn’t pretty, but Caleb Williams’ life in the NFL is off to a winning start.

The 2024 No. 1 overall pick struggled throughout the Chicago Bears’ opener against the Tennessee Titans behind a shaky offensive line and with some understandable rookie inexperience.

The Bears fell into a 17-point deficit and it took a heroic effort from Chicago’s defense and special teams to drag them out of that hole.

First, Jonathan Owens – husband of US gymnast Simone Biles – returned a blocked punt for a touchdown to begin the comeback. The seven-time Olympic gold medalist seemed overjoyed at the moment, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter: “I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK.”

Then, after a couple of Cairo Santos field goals to tie the game, Bears cornerback Tyrique Stevenson intercepted Titans quarterback Will Levis, returning it 43 yards for a touchdown to give Chicago a 24-17 lead and the win to begin the Williams-era in Illinois on a high note.

Williams – who went 14-of-29 throws for 93 yards – became the first quarterback taken with the No. 1 pick to win his Week 1 debut in more than 20 years and just the fourth ever.

Despite the obvious improvements he can make, Williams wasn’t worried about the performance.

“Yeah, I don’t care about stats. I feel great,” Williams said. “To be honest with you, I feel great.”

He added: “Obviously, we didn’t perform how we wanted to (offensively). We want to be the most efficient team out there, myself included. Didn’t perform the way I wanted to.

I missed a few passes that I normally don’t miss. All these other things.”

sport,"World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beats Taylor Fritz to win US Open, extending American men’s tennis grand slam singles drought",2024-09-08,"Jill Martin, Andy Scholes","New York CNN —

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has won his second grand slam singles title, beating American Taylor Fritz to win the US Open 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday.

Fritz, the world No. 12, was bidding to be the first American man to win a grand slam singles title in 21 years. Andy Roddick, who was in attendance Sunday, is the last American man to do it when he won the 2003 US Open.

The 23-year-old Sinner, on an 11-match win streak, won the Australian Open in January. He joins Flavia Pennetta, who won the women’s singles championship in 2015, as the only Italian singles champions in US Open tournament history.

“This title for me means so much because the last period of my career was really not easy,” Sinner said. “There is my team who supports me every day, the people who are close to me. I love tennis. I practice a lot for this kind of stages, but I also realize that off the court there is a life.

“I would like to dedicate this title to my aunt, because she is really not feeling well, health-wise. I don’t know how much I still have her in my life. It’s so nice that I can share a positive moment still with her. … If there would be the biggest wish, I would wish the best health to everyone, but unfortunately, it’s not possible.”

Sinner spoke more about his aunt during his post-match press conference.

“My aunt, she’s a very important person, because when my parents, they were working every day and all day, so sometimes when I had to go to ski races, I went with her,” Sinner said. “She always helped me in summertime when my parents were working and I had some days off or free days.

“You know, when you are young, you don’t go to practice every day. So I hang around a lot with her, and she’s a very important person in my life.

“This also, especially when I had this difficult time, I tried to see it in a different way, you know, sport, things can happen unfortunately, but, you know, the real life is something different.

“You know, we travel a lot, so it’s difficult to spend time with the people who you really love, but if I would have more time, for sure I would spend more time with the people I really care (about).

“Yeah, it was and is a really difficult moment also now, but, you know, just also have to accept that, yeah, not everything is perfect.”

Fritz: ‘I’m sorry I couldn’t get it done’

Fritz is the first American man to reach a grand slam singles final since Roddick was runner-up to Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2009. Roddick had been the last American man to reach the US Open singles final, losing to Federer in 2006.

An American man was guaranteed to reach the final when Fritz and No. 20 Frances Tiafoe played each other in the semifinals, with Fritz coming back in that match from a two-sets-to-one deficit.

Previously, Fritz’s best result at a major was reaching the quarterfinals, where the 26-year-old had been 0-4 at that stage.

“Being an American, at the US Open, it’s just incredible feeling the love all week,” Fritz said to the crowd. “Thank you so much. I know we’ve been waiting for a champion for a long time, so I’m sorry I couldn’t get it done this time. But I’m going to keep working, and hopefully I’ll get it the next time.”

Sinner looked unflappable while winning the first two sets. But that changed in the third. The Italian’s level dipped, allowing Fritz – and the New York crowd – back into the match and giving the American a 5-3 lead.

The momentum shift, however, did not last. Fritz was unable to serve out the set, and Sinner went on to win the next four games for the title.

Sinner: ‘I knew that I haven’t done anything wrong’

Sinner’s triumph comes against the backdrop of his recent doping case that became public knowledge on August 20 – news that shocked the tennis world.

Sinner, who avoided suspension after twice testing positive for trace amounts of the banned substance Clostebol, repeatedly has said he hasn’t done anything wrong. It was ruled Sinner bore “no fault or negligence,” with Sinner saying the positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination” through treatment from his then-physiotherapist.

Sinner told CNN how he was able to play well despite that hanging over him.

“First of all, in my mind, I knew that I haven’t done anything wrong, so that’s already the biggest part for me mentally that I am OK,” Sinner said.

“In another way, it’s me and my team, we know what we went through for months. We know what we were feeling like in the last months. This means even more of a positive sign for me and my team because we put a lot of extra work in trying to be as ready as possible mentally.”

This is the first year since 2002 that none of the members of men’s tennis “Big Three” – Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and the now-retired Federer – won a grand slam. Instead, the majors were split by Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, with the Spaniard winning the French Open and Wimbledon.

At this year’s US Open, Djokovic was upset in the third round by Alexei Popyrin, while Nadal did not play.

“It’s tough to predict the future,” Sinner said to CNN on whether it’s the changing of the guard in men’s tennis.

“I think it’s nice for tennis to see some new champions, some new favorites of tournaments. I’m happy to be part of this, at least this year.

“Let’s see what’s coming next year. Obviously they’re all big, big challenges coming up. But I’m just looking forward to improve as a player and then we’ll see what I can do.”

The rich and famous routinely turn out for the US Open, and Sunday was no exception. In attendance were Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce – who were sitting with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes. Others on hand included Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Noah Lyles and Elon Musk."
sport,None of the Big Three has won a grand slam this year. They leave a legacy which has transformed tennis on and off the court.,2024-09-10,Issy Ronald,"When a star bursts into light, it is more often than not part of a multiple star system, gravitationally bound to its other counterparts, orbiting around the center of gravity between them, each one’s cosmic position utterly dependent on the other.

For more than 20 years, men’s tennis has conformed to this pattern, too – its three biggest stars bound together; their legacies, achievements and careers entwined with their rivalries. During this time, the sport itself has sometimes seemed like a planet simply orbiting around the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, as they hoovered up 66 of the 81 grand slam singles titles available between 2003 and 2023.

But this year, men’s tennis has had a different complexion since none of Federer, Nadal or Djokovic has won a grand slam title for the first time since 2002. Though Djokovic is still able to challenge for the biggest titles – as evidenced by his Olympic gold medal in August – it is now possible to see the shape of men’s tennis without the Big Three, and the complete impact they have left on the sport.

Whatever comes next is unlikely to mirror the previous era, leaving men’s tennis in an unfamiliar position, shorn of its three biggest icons who transcended the court. But they are leaving the sport in a healthy position, full of promising young players primed to occupy the space between sport and pop culture that remains.

‘The shift of power’

The era of the so-called Big Three has been waning for a while. Federer retired in 2022; Nadal’s brilliance has been sapped by recent injuries and he has said his own retirement date is close; Andy Murray, who consistently challenged the Big Three’s dominance and won three grand slam titles himself, retired last month as well.

But with Djokovic proving almost completely dominant in 2023 – winning three grand slams and only losing the final of the fourth in a five-set epic match – it seemed that the march of time would halt for at least one of them. Djokovic, however, last won an ATP title in November 2023, perhaps signaling the beginning of a new era in which the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will be headlining the sport.

They split the grand slams between them this year – Sinner, 22, won his first two major titles at the Australian Open and US Open while Alcaraz, 21, added the French Open and Wimbledon to make his tally four. In two of those grand slam finals, Alcaraz defeated Djokovic while Sinner defeated the Serb on his way to the Australian Open crown in January.

“The healthiest shift of power in sport is when the young guys are taking out the best of all time,” seven-time grand slam champion and Eurosport expert Mats Wilander tells CNN Sport, noting that Djokovic isn’t quite in his best form.

“That’s where this shift differs from other generations, where you would have had a great generation and then there was a lull for a few years … Pete Sampras stopped at the top of his game. That’s not the case with the Big Three, they pushed it all the way to the end.”

Such a shift has allowed for several “passing of the torch” moments, as the younger generation seeks to stamp its authority on the game. Already, new rivalries are emerging, most notably between Sinner and Alcaraz, whose five-and-a-quarter-hour-long clash in the 2022 US Open quarterfinal was “probably the best match of the decade so far on the men’s side,” according to tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg, even as they play without the contrasting styles that defined the Federer-Nadal rivalry.

It is likely, too, that titles will be shared around more equally, providing more opportunities for the American contingent of Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe and Ben Shelton to perhaps pick up a grand slam, as well as further opportunities for the likes of Holger Rune and 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev. A great career, in this era, will look different to those of the Big Three since it is unlikely that the younger generation will win the 20, 22 or 24 grand slam titles won by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, respectively.

“There has to be a real recalibration … because I already see people talking, like, ‘Can Alcaraz catch Djokovic’s grand slam record?’” Rothenberg tells CNN Sport. “It’s a totally unfair measuring stick to use to quantify the current greats. Being in a generation where these three men plus Serena (Williams) all broke 20 really warped the perspective on what makes for a great career.”

‘Pushing the limits’

Even without the physical presence of the Big Three, their influence will still linger in this new era. So many of the players now challenging Djokovic grew up watching him compete against Nadal and Federer and, inevitably, they have influenced the way that the younger generations play.

Almost no one plays like Federer, Wilander says, because “it’s so difficult to be that clean technically and that effortless … (though) they might play a slice backhand here and there, come to the net a little bit.” The newer generation plays much more like Djokovic, he adds, “because that’s a way more basic way of hitting the ball, and of course, the Rafa Nadal effect on the game is racket head speed, where if you are really strong and you’re very loose, you can generate an enormous amount of topspin.”

And the Big Three’s dominance for such a long time has created a so-called “lost generation” of players unfortunate enough to be born in the 10 years after them, skewing the ages of those most successful on tour to be either at the end or beginning of their careers. Medvedev and Dominic Thiem, who is retiring at the end of this year, are still the only men born in the 1990s to win a grand slam.

“In the past, it was always: get to the quarterfinals, play Rafa and check your flights,” Simon Cambers – a journalist and co-author of “The Roger Federer Effect” – tells CNN Sport.

Trying to keep up with the Big Three has already taken its toll on the younger players.

“Because the three of them are so physically good, technique is good, the mind is so strong, the younger guys that come up … they are pushing the limits physically to the point where Alcaraz has already had a number of injuries because it’s so explosive,” Wilander says.

“I think they’ll figure it out, but it’s not going to look the same as the careers of the Big Three,” he adds. “It’s going to look different and we should get used to that.”

Making tennis ‘cool’

Off the court, the Big Three, particularly Federer, helped to cultivate a new image of a tennis player.

“Tennis now more than ever is cool in culture, whether it’s the style or what not, I think a lot of that can be attributed to the achievements of these three guys,” Jett Wright – a tennis agent at Topnotch Management – tells CNN Sport.

By the time Federer was 25 years old, renowned American novelist David Foster Wallace was writing essays about him, describing his play as a kind of “kinetic beauty,” eliciting a “religious experience” from the spectators lucky enough to be courtside. At the same time, his charisma, myriad of brand endorsements and friendship with Anna Wintour helped transform him into as much a pop culture figure and fashion icon as an athlete. Men’s tennis had never really seen anything like it.

“I remember when Federer was voted the best professional athlete in the world,” says Wilander. “And I don’t even know if we had a tennis player have that before … Don’t get me wrong, Pete Sampras, amazing athlete, Björn Borg. But (with) Federer, people started to get an idea that … tennis players might be the strongest and quickest with unbelievable stamina, flexibility, individuality, mentally strong.”

By taking on this role, Federer blazed a path for those who followed behind him – including Nadal and Djokovic – to cross over into the world outside tennis.

“Nowadays, I think it’s almost normal that Matteo Berrettini is a model for Hugo Boss, Sinner for Gucci, etc.,” says journalist Simon Graf, co-author of “The Roger Federer Effect” alongside Cambers.

In the past year, the number of brands advertising in tennis increased by 40%, according to SponsorUnited, a sports and entertainment research platform, making a faster increase than many other sports including the MLB, MLS and the NBA. More clothing and athleisure brands are investing in the sport, Wright adds, with tennis being “cool” and aligned with current fashion trends.

The new generation are proving themselves capable of driving high ticket prices, too. On average, fans were paying about $500 for the all-American semifinal between Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe on Friday, the fifth-most-expensive US Open men’s semifinal on record, a TickPick spokesperson told CNN.

As more playing opportunites open up for a wider pool of players, the commercial opportunities are not too far behind since “brands are able to start working with a younger player and know there’s serious potential for that player to do well in the next three, four, five years,” says Wright.

As more and more of these young stars make a name for themselves outside of the Big Three’s shadow, this golden era of men’s tennis will slowly fade into memory.

“Sport moves on all the time,” says Cambers. “It seems strangely a long time since Federer played now. But these guys are so massive in terms of personality and impact that they’ll be missed a lot.”"

Thousands braved the soggy conditions inside the Stade de France on Sunday, with athletes from the 169 delegations parading and dancing through the venue to officially mark the end of the Games.

There were performances from French electronic musician Jean-Michel Jarre and DJ Martin Solveig, among others, as well as elaborate light shows and a spectacular fireworks display.

“Dear athletes,” Paris 2024 organizing chief Tony Estanguet said in his speech at the ceremony, “this has been incredible, undeniable, unforgettable, and it’s all thanks to you. Every time you competed, more people joined the party; every time you succeeded, the intensity grew.

“With every wow, every cry, every heart you sent racing, you changed how people see sport and how they see disability.”

Meanwhile, Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee, said that Paris had “set a benchmark” for future Paralympics, while also calling for wider social change towards people with disabilities.

“Beyond 12 days of sport, we must break down the barriers that exist in society,” said Parsons. “We must enable and empower persons with disabilities to excel outside of the field of play, in education, in employment, in entertainment, in government, in civil society – everywhere.

“Diversity and difference should not divide us. Diversity and difference should unite us, drive change and make this planet better for everyone.”

Around 4,400 athletes competed in this year’s Paralympics across 549 medal events in 22 sports. Scores of records were broken, including more than 40 in para athletics and 30 in the swimming.

China finished first in the medal table with 94 golds (220 total), way ahead of Great Britain in second on 49 golds and USA in third on 36. This is the sixth year in a row that China has topped the medal table, while Britain and the US were also second and third at the Tokyo Paralympics.

The US ends the Games with 105 medals, one more than in Tokyo, and chose swimmer Ellie Marks and wheelchair basketball player Paul Schulte, veterans of the team making their third and fourth Paralympic appearances in Paris, as flagbearers at the closing ceremony.

Attention now turns to Los Angeles, which will host the next edition of the Olympics and Paralympics in 2028.

Attention now turns to Los Angeles, which will host the next edition of the Olympics and Paralympics in 2028.

sport,Hunter Woodhall: American Paralympic champion drew ‘confidence’ from his wife’s Olympic gold medal,2024-09-07,"Issy Ronald, Don Riddell","As Hunter Woodhall crossed the line and sealed a Paralympic gold medal in the men’s 400m T62 final, he let out a roar and carried on running to find his wife, Tara Davis-Woodhall.

Their celebration, her in the stands tearfully hugging him on the track, mirrored one that had captured the world a month earlier when she had sealed an Olympic gold medal in the women’s long jump and then launched herself into his arms while he was in the stands, overwhelmed with joy.

“I remember just hearing the crowd roar, and looking back at my family, at Tara, my team and just to see the joy they had in that moment, I had to go share it with them,” Woodhall told CNN’s Don Riddell of the moment when he sealed his maiden Paralympic gold medal on Friday.

Seeing his wife win her Olympic title a month earlier instilled a confidence in him that he too could win a gold medal in Paris – the goal he had been working towards for so long after winning a silver aged just 17 in Rio in 2016 and two bronzes in Tokyo three years ago.

“I know that we do the same things, we train together, we eat together, we recover the same way,” he said. “Seeing Tara go out there and absolutely dominate, it gave me such confidence to say I know we’ve done the same thing, and she’s able to go out there and do that then I know I’m capable of doing the same thing.”

The couple were careful not to over-celebrate Davis-Woodhall’s Olympic gold medal at the time, given that their goal was only half-complete with Woodhall still yet to compete at the Paralympics.

“What she did was so incredible but trying not too put too much time and mental energy into it because we knew we had something else,” he said. “It takes somebody who is really genuine and thoughtful to be able to do that and such a sacrifice and such a humility, I’m really grateful.”

Finally able to relax completely when the sprinter won his Paralympic title too, the couple’s celebrations spilled out onto the track as Woodhall picked his wife up and they spun around together, laughing as she punched the air.

“Me and Tara, we could sit on the porch and watch sunsets every day, we love just being around each other, spending time together, we just work together,” he said.

“We communicate so much and we know that neither of us are perfect but we know that we make each other better,” he added. “We just have a lot of fun.”

Such celebrations come loaded with almost every conceivable emotion, being a commemoration of each athlete’s specific journey to the Games. Woodhall was born with a fused right ankle and a condition called fibular hemimelia, which affected his left leg. Just before he turned one, he had both his legs amputated from the knees down.

“I got my first pair of prosthetics at 15 months, so I started with the cards stacked against me a little bit,” he said. “I remember my dad instilling in me that: ‘Hey, you’re always going to be different and that’s not something you can change but what’s important is that you know who you are, and you understand your value.’

“Everyone has burdens and challenges that we deal with and in a funny way I’m grateful that I kind of dealt with some of my biggest challenges early in life and it taught me to overcome and be grateful for these opportunities, and these really special moments that we get in life.”

When asked to imagine talking to his younger self with his Paralympic gold medal around his neck, Woodhall became emotional, saying: “I would tell him how special he is and how cool it is to be different.”

“I’d tell him to believe in himself,” he added, nodding his head as his voice broke."

sport,The US dominates the Olympics. Why can’t it do the same at the Paralympics?,2024-09-07,Jack Hillcox,"Olympic fans looking at the Paralympics final medal table are faced with an unfamiliar sight: Team USA lagging behind in the medal table.

While US Olympians have been dominating medal counts and airwaves for decades, their Paralympic colleagues have had far more modest success.

So far in the 21st century, the US has only failed to top the Olympic medal table once, but its average place in the Paralympic medals table from 2000 until Paris was fourth.

Ukraine, a nation with a population around a tenth that of the US and a GDP less than 1% that of the US, has beaten Team USA in two of the last four Paralympic Games.

However, since coming sixth in the medal table at the 2012 Paralympics in London, there has been a steady improvement in the United States’ position, coming fourth in Rio in 2016 and third in Tokyo in 2021.

In the final 2024 medal table, the US finished third – behind China and Great Britain – with 36 gold medals and 105 in total.

So, can Team USA continue to turn things around?

The US once dominated the Paralympics in the same way it does the Olympic Games.

Between 1976 and 1996, Team USA topped the medal table at every single Paralympics. The US is the all-time record holder for most overall and gold Paralympic medals, largely due to the nation’s dominance during this period.

Julie Dussliere, United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) chief of Paralympics, attributes Team USA’s relative drop in the medals tables to the global growth of the Paralympic movement, told CNN Sport: “Team USA remains incredibly strong and well supported – and we are thrilled by the performance so far in Paris.”

One could be forgiven for being unaware of Team USA’s fluctuating fortunes, as the Paralympics have historically struggled to attract TV viewers in numbers anywhere close to the Olympics. In 2000, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Sydney Olympics were watched by a combined TV audience of 3.7 billion. The Sydney Paralympics, however, were seen by a more modest 300 million people – in other words, 92% fewer people saw the Paralympics than the Olympics that year.

The sparse coverage provided to the Paralympic Games was described by former para athlete and Team USA captain Kristin Duqette as “a disservice to society,” who added: “The reality is, being disabled is a part of being human.”

Mary Hums, a sport administration professor at the University of Louisville who has worked at four Paralympic Games, told CNN Sport that a lack of prominent role models can impact people taking up para sport, and ultimately becoming Paralympians. “If you can’t see one, you don’t think you can be one,” she said.

This sentiment is echoed by Dussliere, who said that US success “helps drive participation and competition.”

This lack of visibility can delay future elite athletes from beginning their training. Duqette was a five-time American record holder in para swimming but told CNN that she wasn’t aware of the Paralympics until she was 15 years old.

In some international markets, TV audiences for the Paralympics have been provided with more coverage compared to those in the US.

In 2012, UK broadcaster Channel 4 showed over 400 hours of Paralympics coverage. In the US, however, American rights-holder NBC broadcast just four one-hour highlights packages on cable channel NBC Sports. In response to NBC’s coverage plan, then head of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Philip Craven, told the Daily Telegraph: “Some people think that North America always lead on everything, and on this they don’t. It’s about time they caught up.”

Organizers of the Paris Paralympics are promising that the 2024 Games will be the most-watched in Paralympic history, with all sports being broadcast for the first time.

NBC has increased its TV coverage of the Games to over 140 hours split across NBC, USA Network and CNBC, as well as a “record amount of primetime hours,” but this primetime coverage still looks to be confined to three highlights specials. NBC said it is making “an unprecedented commitment to the Paralympics” and will also broadcast around 1,500 hours of coverage on its streaming service Peacock.

The UK’s Channel 4, meanwhile, has increased its coverage to 1,300 live hours across TV and free-to-access digital platforms and will broadcast coverage of the Games on its TV channel almost continuously from 8 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. local throughout the duration of the Paralympics.

The US is far from the only country to have more limited TV coverage for the Paralympics. In some nations, such as India, the Paralympics will not be shown live on any TV channel.

“Future potential athletes have no role models to show them what they are capable of at a time in their lives when most of society is telling them they are incapable of just about anything useful,” Ian Brittain, an academic at Coventry University and an expert in the study of Paralympic sport, told CNN.

“Sponsors are put off investing because their brand or product won’t get the necessary coverage, however successful the athlete is.

“It also reinforces the idea that the Paralympics and therefore Paralympians and/or disabled people are less important and less worthy of attention and acclaim than their non-disabled counterparts, which in turn continues their marginalization and exclusion from the wider society.”

In addition to less media coverage of the Paralympics, lack of visibility may also encourage a lack of general interest among audiences. According to Google Trends data, during the 2016 Games there were 60 nations with more search interest in the Paralympics than the US, including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Germany.

Another major obstacle to US Paralympic dominance is the strength and depth of China’s para athletes squad.

Team USA tends to have one of the largest presences in the Olympic Village, with the American delegation in Paris sending 20 more athletes to the Olympics than host nation France. Team USA’s Paralympic representation, however, was smaller, with the nation only sending the fourth-largest group to the City of Light.

China, on the other hand, sent the largest number of athletes to the Paris Paralympics – 282 compared to the United States’ 220. The Asian nation’s investment into sporting infrastructure is also a boon; Chinese Paralympians are able to train at the world’s largest training facility for elite athletes with disabilities, as well as at 30 other regional training centers.

“Unless a country is willing to replicate this kind of factory farming of para athletes and invest resources to this degree and beyond – or China decides it no longer wishes to do this – China will continue to dominate for many decades to come,” Brittain told CNN.

Indeed, the Asian nation finished top of the medal table in Paris by a large margin with 94 gold medals – slightly less than the United States’ total haul – and 220 total.

There are hopes that Los Angeles hosting the Paralympics in 2028 will be an opportunity to fundamentally change attitudes to para sport and disability in general in the US.

“LA has a history of transformational Games and this is no doubt a huge opportunity to grow Paralympic sport, and reimagine the way the community in LA and across the United States engages,” Dussliere told CNN.

“Combined with hosting in Salt Lake in 2034, this decade of sport has the potential to (be) extraordinarily impactful for Paralympic sport in the United States.”

Hums said China’s improving position in the medal table through the 1990s and 2000s was “consistent with a country hosting an upcoming Games (in 2008).”

“Sport has the power to inform, it has the power to empower, it has the power to transform,” she said. “Hosting a Games can shine a light on an underlying issue that can then be addressed.”

Duquette said that hosting the Games will provide the opportunity to show an “organic representation of disability and disabled sports,” which she believes will “break down so many barriers.”

According to a 2014 UK government report, almost 70% of the British public believed attitudes towards disabled people had improved since London hosted the 2012 Paralympics.

But hosting the Olympics and Paralympics is not a silver bullet.

Even avid supporters of the Games have acknowledged the difficulties of a singular event to affect society. “It is hard to expect a Games to deliver all the social change that disabled people require to lead equitable lives in the UK,” British Paralympic gold medalist Tanni Grey-Thompson has said.

In 2024, 12 years after the UK hosted the Paralympics, the UK government was criticized by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) for failing to address “grave and systematic violations of the human rights of persons with disabilities.”

Brittain told CNN that change needs to start “with government and spreading out to everyone else in society. It’s also a long-term process – not something that happens in two weeks in 2028.”

He added: “Plans and resources that are co-designed with disabled people need to be put in play now, regularly monitored and evaluated and also resourced for the next 25-30 years.”

Despite Team USA not finishing at the top of the medal table in Paris, are we likely to see the US improve even more and claim back the top spot in LA?

It is difficult to see American dominance like in 1970s, 80s and 90s, but there is hope. As Duquette said, “The US has come so far, and we still have so much further to go.”"

sport,Ali Truwit: Reentering the pool caused ‘flashbacks’ to shark attack in which she lost her leg. Now this US swimmer has two Paralympic medals,2024-09-08,"Don Riddell, Issy Ronald","When American swimmer Ali Truwit first got back into the water after losing her leg in a shark attack, the sound of water rippling around the pool “triggered flashbacks” to that day.

“It was really, really hard,” she told CNN’s Don Riddell. “At that point physically, the temperature of the water sent what felt like electric shocks throughout my leg because it was newly amputated with all of these new nerve endings and then emotionally hearing the sound of water triggered flashbacks to the attack.”

But at the same time, there were “glimmers of hope,” she added, “moments in the water that felt peaceful and joyful” as she sought to reclaim her “love of water.”

And just 16 months after that life-changing day, she was swimming on the biggest stage of all, winning two Paralympic silver medals in Paris in the women’s S10 400-meter freestyle and 100m backstroke.

“It’s an indescribable feeling, but it’s on the shoulders of so many who have been such a great support to me this year and even in the stands in Paris,” she said.

Truwit was a competitive swimmer for Yale University, where she majored in cognitive science and economics, and was on holiday with her teammate Sophie Pilkinton, snorkelling in the Turks and Caicos Islands when the attack happened.

“It was a terrifying day, a terrifying time and a terrible moment, one that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy,” Truwit said. “But when I look back now, I really try to instead focus on the strength that Sophie and I showed and how grateful I am for Sophie’s composure and medical knowledge and expertise, but selflessness and friendship to save my life.”

They managed to fight off the shark and swim back to the boat where her friend applied a tourniquet to stem the bleeding. Truwit was then airlifted to hospital where doctors operated three times and eventually amputated her left leg just below the knee on her 23rd birthday.

“I definitely have flashbacks to the attack and you know in the early days had several nightmares,” she said. “My mom would spend countless sleepless nights with me helping coach me through them. But I think just learning to face fear, learning that I can have a flashback and I’m ok and I get through it.”

Within the first month of the attack, Noelle Lambert, an American Paralympic track and field athlete who also competed in Paris, had contacted Truwit and “planted the seed” of competing at a Paralympic Games.

“It started … just with a quest to regain my love of the water and then a quest to get some exercise and cardio which I was sorely missing and it started to kind of unfold into what if? What if I could make it?,” she said.

“And typically when I have what ifs they don’t end very positive. They’re kind of nervous and anxious thoughts and so it was exciting to me that I had a what if that was so exciting and happy amidst a lot of sadness and tears.”

And as she competed in Paris, her family, her coach – who came out of retirement to guide her back to competitive swimming – and her friends, including those who saved her life, were all there cheering in the stands as she clinched her silver medals

“My lifesavers, heroes, sisters, best friends. The most selfless incredible caring strong inspirations I’ll ever have,” she wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of the two friends she says saved her life."

“It started … just with a quest to regain my love of the water and then a quest to get some exercise and cardio which I was sorely missing and it started to kind of unfold into what if? What if I could make it?,” she said.

“And typically when I have what ifs they don’t end very positive. They’re kind of nervous and anxious thoughts and so it was exciting to me that I had a what if that was so exciting and happy amidst a lot of sadness and tears.”

And as she competed in Paris, her family, her coach – who came out of retirement to guide her back to competitive swimming – and her friends, including those who saved her life, were all there cheering in the stands as she clinched her silver medals

“My lifesavers, heroes, sisters, best friends. The most selfless incredible caring strong inspirations I’ll ever have,” she wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of the two friends she says saved her life."
sport,Chuck Aoki reflects on Paralympic silver medal after defeat to Japan,2024-09-06,Jamie Barton,"Chuck Aoki is the most decorated wheelchair rugby player in US history, but that did not stop him from feeling a touch of disappointment as the Americans took silver in the Paralympics on Monday having lost 48-41 to Japan.

“I think that obviously as a competitor, you want to do your absolute best, and the best you can do is a gold medal,” he told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell. “So it’s going to be disappointing any time you come up short of that. But there’s a lot of sweetness in silver.”

Aoki made his first Paralympics appearance at London 2012, where the team claimed the bronze medal. That was followed by three consecutive Paralympic silvers – Rio in 2016, Tokyo in 2021 and this week’s second-place finish in Paris.

The American has used a wheelchair since he was 12, having been born with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), which inhibits sensation in his hands and feet. Now 33, the American reflected on the confidence that wheelchair rugby has given him.

“It’s freeing in the way that when you get in the chair – which is like a little tank, quite frankly – you’re just able to move so effortlessly up and down the court. You’re gliding, you don’t feel limited by it. It allows you to excel, it allows you to compete, it allows you to be your most athletic, physical self out there. And that’s a really cool thing,” he said.

“You can sometimes feel lesser than, or limited by your disability. But in wheelchair rugby, your wheelchair is an asset. It’s part of you that you use to compete at the highest level. And so rugby has always been a place where I felt at home, and that’s been a very freeing feeling for me in terms of just being able to be my fullest self on the court.”

‘Murderball’ inspiration

Inspired by “Murderball,” the 2005 documentary film which followed the fortunes of the US wheelchair rugby team in the lead-up to the 2004 Paralympics, Aoki begged his parents to let him try out the sport.

“It probably wasn’t quite as harsh as I’ve made it sound sometimes, but as part of my disability, I injured myself fairly easily,” he said. “So there was definitely apprehension like, ‘Wow, we’re going to let him play the sport where he crashes into people?’

“But my mom has told me subsequently that a doctor said at one point that, ‘You can have your kid live in a glass bubble and he can just look at the world and see what’s going on but never actually get to be a part of it, or he can get out of it and he can go experience life and live it.’ She said that really resonated with her.

“Once I got out there, my mother, the sweet librarian, turned out to know a lot more curse words when I first got knocked over than I could have possibly imagined!”

His 2024 Paralympics only came to an end on Monday, but Aoki is already looking forward to Los Angeles 2028.

“The phrase once in a lifetime gets thrown around a lot, but a home Games is truly once in a lifetime,” he said. “There would be nothing sweeter than to get my first gold medal at home.

“I never stopped desiring to be the best of what I do. I love this sport so much. I have so much passion for it, so much energy, and quite frankly it’s so much fun. If it ever stops being fun, I’ll stop doing it.”"

sport,"Hunter Woodhall watched his wife become Olympic champion in Paris. Now, he’s a Paralympic gold medalist",2024-09-02,Ben Church,"US sprinter Hunter Woodhall didn’t need to look far for inspiration at this year’s Paralympic Games.

The 25-year-old won his first Paralympic gold medal in the 400m T62 on Friday, after watching his wife Tara Davis-Woodhall become the Olympic long-jump champion in August.

He raced to victory with a time of 46.36 seconds, ahead of Johannes Floors of Germany and the Netherlands’ Olivier Hendriks, who took silver and bronze respectively. After crossing the line, Woodhall kept running to find his wife in the crowd at the Stade de France.

When asked about how it felt to win gold along with his wife, Woodhall joked that he was “waiting to wake up.”

“I have the best team in the world,” Woodhall told the NBC broadcast. “Best team in the world. I couldn’t have done it without them.”

Woodhall had traveled to watch his partner compete in the French capital and was the first person to celebrate with her when she won the gold medal – the pair sharing an emotional embrace as she leapt into his arms at the front of the stadium.

“It was incredible, so surreal. I’m so proud. I’ve never wanted something so badly for somebody else,” Woodhall told CNN Sport before flying out to Paris.

“Every single day this year, we’ve just tried to do the right things. This is what we train for. Nothing is guaranteed in sports, in athletics anything can happen. So when it actually does go the way that you plan it to, and you just have that moment of relief, it’s surreal. It was a really special moment.”

The couple met during a high school track meet back in 2017 and married five years later.

Over the years, they have formed a formidable partnership both on and off the track, pushing each other to reach heights that neither thought was possible.

They now spend almost every minute with each other, whether that be training on the track or in the gym, eating practically the same diet or working to grow their already huge social media presence – the couple have over 866,000 YouTube subscribers to their channel, which chronicles their sporting careers and relationship.

With Davis-Woodhall having reached her lofty potential by securing an Olympic gold medal, it was over to Woodhall to replicate her achievement this week.

Paris is the sprinter’s third Paralympic Games, having burst onto the global stage back in 2016.

As a teenager, he won a bronze and a silver medal at the Rio Games and then claimed another bronze in Tokyo. A gold medal had stayed elusive prior to Paris, but the American was determined than ever to .

“That’s the goal,” added Woodhall ahead of this year’s Games. “This has been the most consistent I’ve ever been. It’s the most dialed in I’ve ever been. And I’m running the best I’ve ever ran. I’m the most fit I’ve ever been.

“You know, I can’t control what anybody else does, but what I can do is make sure I go out there and give it my best effort and do exactly what I can.”

Woodhall, who recently recovered from a bout of Covid-19 before traveling to France, also competed in the 100m T64 in Paris on Monday, where he came sixth with a time of 10.96 seconds. Costa Rica﻿’s Sherman Isidro Guity took gold in a Paralympic record 10.65 seconds, with Maxcel Amo Manu of Italy and Germany’s Felix Streng claiming silver and bronze respectively.

Like every Paralympian competing in Paris this year, Woodhall’s journey hasn’t been straight-forward.

He was born with a fused right ankle and a condition called fibular hemimelia, which affected his left leg. Just before he turned one, he had both his legs amputated from the knees down.

While life-changing, the procedure allowed Woodhall to get fitted with prosthetic legs, defying some who said he would never be able to walk.

Given his father was in the Air Force, Woodhall and his two older brothers were home-schooled at first, but his parents would always emphasize the importance of exercise.

It meant Woodhall spent his early years chasing after his brothers, trying his hand at various sports. It was, as he said, a “great environment to be raised in.”

But life became a little more difficult when Woodhall enrolled into public school in fifth-grade. It was there that he really recognized his differences, and initially struggled with bullying from other children.

In search of somewhere to feel comfortable, he eventually found track and field. Unlike other sports where coaches would sometimes feel nervous about letting him play, athletics allowed Woodhall to express himself.

“It was just me versus the clock and I found peace in that. I found excitement in that. It’s just up to me to get a little bit better,” he said, admitting it took a while before his talent shone through.

“I kind of fell in love with that process and it took me a while. From seventh grade all the way up until my sophomore year of high school, I was not impressive in any way on the track.

“But just all those years of dedication and little changes, getting a little better every year, definitely added up. It got me to where I am now.”

Not only is Woodhall now one of the best para sprinters in the world, he has also become one of the faces of this year’s Games and wants to use his profile to champion the Paralympics.

For some, the extra popularity would come with unwanted added pressure, but Woodhall is just happy to help get more eyes on the sport.

Paris dreams

Having spent time helping his wife prepare and compete in Paris last month, Woodhall might have had a secret weapon up his sleeve for this year’s Paralympics.

He said he used his time visiting Europe to analyze how long his body took to adapt to the differing time zones – something he said was a huge advantage when planning his own preparation.

His time in France also allowed him to familiarize himself with the Stade de France, a venue that he will always remember as the place he won his first gold medal.

“I think the visualization was huge. Just seeing how everything kind of goes down, seeing the stadium, the practice track, just all of it. I got an up close and personal look,” he added.

﻿Woodhall added a bronze to his medal haul in the 4x100m universal relay, which finished with China and Great Britain earning gold and silver respectively ahead of the US.

The American is just happy to have the chance to live out a seemingly impossible dream, but now, he leaves Paris having claimed the biggest prize of all."

sport,Vinícius Jr. tells CNN that he and Real Madrid teammates would walk off the pitch in reaction to racist abuse,2024-08-28,"Matias Grez, Zayn Nabbi, Darren Lewis","Vinícius Jr. breaks down in tears. The painful toll of the racism he faces with uncomfortable regularity when playing for Real Madrid is clear to see in his face.

That was back in April, when Vinícius was asked by reporters ahead of Brazil’s international against Spain about his ongoing fight against racism. He said it had reduced his desire to continue playing soccer.

The racist incidents directed towards him in Spain include an effigy of the Brazilian being hanged from a bridge before his side’s clash against city rival Atlético Madrid in January 2023 and persistent racial abuse in a match against Valencia later that year.

Racist slurs have also been caught on camera during Real’s matches at Osasuna, Mallorca, Real Valladolid and Barcelona.

Fast-forward five months and Vinícius is rewatching footage of that emotional press conference. He says opening up was a struggle, but something that he felt was necessary.

“Talking about racism is always very difficult because in the last season here in Madrid, it happened to me a lot – and it’s not even close to what normal people suffer in the streets,” he tells CNN Senior Sport Analyst Darren Lewis. “And I always think about that.

A doll with Vinícius Jr's shirt hangs from a bridge in the vicinity of Valdebebas. The effigy is just one of several racist incidents the Real Madrid star has had to suffer in Spain. Twitter

“So that interview was very important not only for me, but for all the people who trust me and give me a lot of strength so I can keep fighting for all Black people who suffer daily.

“Each day, I have more strength and more wisdom to be able to talk about it and to be able to be – not a shield – but someone who will defend them every time I am able to talk about racism, about all those people who suffer a lot across the world.”

Vinícius says he is encouraged that progress is being made in the fight against racism. “Today,” he says, “I already see and feel the difference in Spain.

“Today – maybe [some fans] are still racists – but nowadays they are afraid to express themselves in the football field, and in places where there are a lot of cameras.

“And with that we will reduce racism, little by little. Of course, we won’t be able to end it, but I’m already happy that I’m being able to change Spain’s mindset.”

In June, a court in Valencia made history by ordering eight-month prison sentences for three men who made racist remarks and gestures toward Vinícius at a La Liga match against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in May 2023.

La Liga said it was “the first conviction of its kind to be handed down in Spain.”

The convicted men will also face two-year stadium bans for all Spanish soccer matches and have been ordered to pay court costs associated with the case.

“In the last few months, there were three people who were jailed for insulting me in one of the matches, and that’s something that will always be stamped in history,” he says.

“Because it was the first time, and each time they do it again, it will be possible to make them pay for making Black people suffer.”

Walking off

In 2019, UEFA approved its three-step protocol to help referees deal with racism from the stands during matches.

The first step is to pause the game if there is racist behavior and ask over the public speaker system for it to stop. If it continues, step two is implemented and the referee can stop the game for up to 10 minutes and send the teams back into the changing rooms.

Step three is to abandon the match completely.

At times, though, certain teams have taken matters into their own hands and walked off the pitch. With hindsight, the team perhaps should have walked off during the match against Valencia, Vinícius says, but it is something they are willing to do this season.

“In the club, we talk about it more often,” he says. “Not just me, but all players said that if that happens, the next time everyone has to leave the field so that all of those people who insulted us have to pay a much bigger penalty.

“In the case of what happened in Valencia, after the game – after we thought about it – everyone said that the right thing to do is to leave the field, but because you are there defending a team, we know that not everyone in the stadium is racist and were just there to watch the game.

“It’s always very difficult to end a game, but with everything that’s been happening, that each time is getting worse, we do need to leave the field so things can change as soon as possible.”"

sport,Oksana Masters: ‘Sports really taught me it was okay to take my legs off in front of people and to still be powerful’,2024-09-03,"Amy Woodyatt, Coy Wire","She now has 19 Paralympic medals to her name across four Summer and Winter Games disciplines – more than most athletes could even dream of.

Yet Team USA athlete Oksana Masters says she still has “so many things” motivating her ahead of the Paralympic Games – including defending the two para-cycling gold medals that she earned in Tokyo. And on Thursday, she achieved just that, winning her second gold medal of the Paris Games in the H5 road race after defending her H4-5 time trial title on Wednesday.

“My dream is to ignite the passion with of cycling and what’s possible on the bike with hand cycling, and grow the women’s field on the bike, especially in the USA. I would love to be there in LA,” she said post race, with eyes on the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.

“I would love to be finishing that finish line along with Team USA athletes, seeing that legacy going on for the future,” she added.

This year, Masters has the opportunity to bring her medal total up to 20: she takes part in the mixed team relay H1-5 on Saturday.

Sport, she tells CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, sent her on a “journey of self-discovery and love.”

Born in Ukraine with significant birth defects believed to be linked to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster – six toes, webbed fingers, no thumbs and legs that were missing weight-bearing bones – Masters spent the first seven years of her life between orphanages before her American mother, Gay Masters, adopted her.

After moving to the US, Masters’ legs were amputated at the ages of nine and 14.

Since winning her first Paralympic medal in rowing at London 2012, the talented multi-disciplined athlete has amassed a total of 17 medals – seven of them gold – in six different editions of the Games in rowing, cross-country skiing, biathlon and cycling.

Immersing herself in these sporting disciplines slowly helped her accept herself.

“That was the journey for me to love myself and accept myself and see my body as powerful and strong. It was not an overnight journey,” she tells CNN.

“Sports really taught me how it was okay to take my legs off in front of people and to still be powerful and feel powerful and use my body in ways and see it in this unique way that I know I feel,” she said.

“I want people to see how I feel about it and not [let] society – just because they don’t know it and are uncomfortable about it – determine how I feel.”

Masters is as resilient as she is talented – after a back injury forced her to retire from rowing following the London Paralympics, she then tried her hand at cross-country skiing, bagging a silver and bronze at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games.

Almost 10 years later, her cycling performance in Tokyo, where she won two gold medals, came less than a year after recovering from leg surgery.

“I came to America with so many scars, and the story was written for me. And I let them define me. I let those memories be what those memories were. But that’s not what defines you,” she tells CNN Sport.

She adds: “It’s not what you’ve been through. It’s what you choose to do and how you move forward and all the things you have done. And the scars are just there to remember how strong [you] are. Whether it’s a scar you got from climbing a tree, or whether it’s a scar that you didn’t ask for, it is – it’s a symbol of power and strength.”

This year, Masters will participate in para cycling races. The 35-year-old athlete said she is always chasing that perfect race, “where it doesn’t matter where I finish on the podium, before I know the result.

“I think a lot of athletes are chasing that perfect race. And, you know, it’s not about the gold medal [that is] what makes a perfect race,” she adds."

Yet Team USA athlete Oksana Masters says she still has “so many things” motivating her ahead of the Paralympic Games – including defending the two para-cycling gold medals that she earned in Tokyo. And on Thursday, she achieved just that, winning her second gold medal of the Paris Games in the H5 road race after defending her H4-5 time trial title on Wednesday.

“My dream is to ignite the passion with of cycling and what’s possible on the bike with hand cycling, and grow the women’s field on the bike, especially in the USA. I would love to be there in LA,” she said post race, with eyes on the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.

“I would love to be finishing that finish line along with Team USA athletes, seeing that legacy going on for the future,” she added.

This year, Masters has the opportunity to bring her medal total up to 20: she takes part in the mixed team relay H1-5 on Saturday.

Sport, she tells CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, sent her on a “journey of self-discovery and love.”

Born in Ukraine with significant birth defects believed to be linked to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster – six toes, webbed fingers, no thumbs and legs that were missing weight-bearing bones – Masters spent the first seven years of her life between orphanages before her American mother, Gay Masters, adopted her.

After moving to the US, Masters’ legs were amputated at the ages of nine and 14.

Since winning her first Paralympic medal in rowing at London 2012, the talented multi-disciplined athlete has amassed a total of 17 medals – seven of them gold – in six different editions of the Games in rowing, cross-country skiing, biathlon and cycling.

Immersing herself in these sporting disciplines slowly helped her accept herself.

“That was the journey for me to love myself and accept myself and see my body as powerful and strong. It was not an overnight journey,” she tells CNN.

“Sports really taught me how it was okay to take my legs off in front of people and to still be powerful and feel powerful and use my body in ways and see it in this unique way that I know I feel,” she said.

sport,"Vinícius Jr.: In world exclusive, Ballon d’Or favorite says, ‘I want to make history with Real Madrid’",2024-08-27,"Zayn Nabbi, Darren Lewis","Real Madrid superstar Vinícius Jr. has his sights set on reaching even greater heights this season, as the Brazilian told CNN Sport in part one of a world exclusive interview that Los Blancos could win a historic treble this season, adding that he hopes to emulate his Brazilian heroes by winning the Ballon d’Or.

Speaking to CNN Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis in his Madrid home, Vinícius was bullish about Los Merengues’ prospects this season of being successful in every major competition, as the reigning Champions League winners prepare to defend their crown.

“Every year, our goal is to win every title we can,” Vinícius said of the 15-time European Cup champion before the team won its sixth European Super Cup against Atalanta.

Winning Madrid’s first ever treble?

For all its success, Madrid has never won a European treble, consisting of the Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey.

Arch-rival FC Barcelona is the only Spanish club to have done so – on two separate occasions in 2009 and 2015.

Explaining why this feat is so rare, Vinícius told CNN, “The Copa del Rey always throws us off from winning the treble because you play against very tough teams throughout January, which is the period when there are the most games, so the cup competition ends up complicating things a bit.”

The Madrid star is clear that the biggest priority for the squad is winning the club’s 16th Champions League but added that he’s also motivated to “finally be able to win the treble.”

“The Champions League comes first, which is the most difficult competition – followed by La Liga and then the Copa. Each one has its own pressure because the weight of the Champions League is because it’s where Real Madrid always wants to win. And not only the players, the fans as well demand that of us, to win that competition, but our goal now is to try and win everything we enter and finally be able to win the treble.”

To begin to appreciate the impact of Vinícius this past season, one should go by the numbers. Fifteen league goals propelled Madrid to yet another Spanish title.

Then there was his crucial strike to seal a second Champions League title in three seasons, when Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 at Wembley earlier this year.

“I’ve always dreamed of playing for Real Madrid, so I cherish every moment like it was the last,” he said.

“Everyone wants to win for the best team on the planet, and to be able to play with the best and to be able to score so many goals in so many finals and to be able to help so much… I’m only 24 years old and I want to continue like this for much longer and to create history in this great team I play in today. Not everyone has that chance to do that, so I talk about enjoying every moment in this jersey.”

Vinícius ended the 2023/24 season as Madrid’s top scorer with 24 goals to go along with 11 assists – this despite missing two months of the campaign between November and January.

Golden dreams

With his knack of showing up when it matters most and his big numbers across the season for arguably the biggest club on the planet, it’s no wonder he is the favorite to win this year’s Ballon d’Or – the annual award handed out for the best player in the world.

For Vinícius, winning the award is almost a sense of living up to Brazilian heritage, ensuring that he follows in the footsteps of the country’s greatest ever modern-day soccer stars as he looks to emulate Marta, Ronaldo Nazário, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo and Kaká, who at some point in their careers have won recognition as the best player in the world.

“I have to talk about Marta, who is the greatest to ever play the [women’s game]. I have great affection for her because I believe she changed the sport and put women’s football on the level it deserves. Women’s football is growing day by day and Marta was one of the pioneers,” he said.

“Marta is for us is what Pelé was for everyone in Brazil, like Ayrton Senna, she’s from a level where there is one person in every million.

“And as for the men’s players, I have Kaká as an example, I have Ronaldo who won the award twice, I have Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, a lot of Brazilian players who have won the Ballon d’Or. But without a doubt, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho are the ones I’m closest with, who tell me every day that I have to win the Ballon d’Or.”

Vinícius tells CNN that he had recently spent some time with O Fenômeno, who has been training him personally.

“I was with Ronaldo just now when I was in Ibiza and trained at his house and he told me: ‘Train here a few more days, so you are closer to the Ballon d’Or.’ They are players who did incredible things and to be able to compete for the Ballon d’Or and to win an award that they won, that would be something really incredible.”

The new Galácticos

Teammates Jude Bellingham and the newly signed Kylian Mbappé will be Vinícius’ main competition for the Ballon d’Or in October, as this latest incarnation of Real Madrid is laden with talent from front to back.

Despite being one of his main competitors for football’s most coveted prize, the Brazilian is extremely excited to have former PSG star Mbappé in Spanish giant’s ranks.

“The team is very good and has been that way for a long time now,” he said.

“Now with the arrival of Mbappé, everyone says the team can become unstoppable, but for now, we have to perform the best training sessions and try to understand each other as quickly as possible.”

Vinícius had long admired Mbappé from afar and now relishes playing with the World Cup winner, admitting to have been impressed with the way he plays.

“I love Mbappé’s style, I love how he plays, and the truth is that I’m very excited about what we can do during the season. He’s coming in after having scored so many goals, after winning so many titles. He’s arriving at the club he always dreamed to be in and where every player always dreamed to play for: Real Madrid.

“God willing, Mbappé will be able to score as many goals for us as he did in his previous team, as he does in the national team, and that he can do even more together with us.”

While Vinícius assisted on the opening goal and the Frenchman scored in his official Los Blancos debut in a 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win, Madrid slipped up against a resolute Mallorca side in its La Liga opener, earning just one point in a 1-1 away draw and showing signs that the team needs to gel more before hitting its full stride.

Despite the misstep in Son Moix and the team having growing pains in the first half of its home opener against Real Valladolid before winning 3-0, the scene is set for an incredibly successful year for Madrid.

Heart set on Madrid success

Recently, rumors bubbled about Vinícius being offered an eyewatering offer of over $1 billion to make a move to Saudi Arabia, similar to rumblings about his new teammate Mbappé in July 2023.

However, the Brazilian star was clear to CNN about his feelings for the future.

“I always play to be among the best and, each day that passes at Real Madrid, I feel more confident.

“I’ve already won two Champions Leagues and I play with others who already won six – [Dani] Carvajal also has won six and they motivate us each day to play beyond our limits and that everything is possible with the team we have now.

“We already made it this far [winning two Champions Leagues in three years], it was really hard. But to stay at the highest level, it’s much harder, so I want to stay at this level for a long time and be able to win as many Champions League as Carvajal, [Luka] Modrić, Nacho and Toni [Kroos], who won six.

“We might have one of the best teams for the next decade, and now, we have to show on the pitch that we can perform. And I, along with my teammates, each time, each game we play, we can get closer to winning Real Madrid more titles.”"

sport,Scottie Scheffler caps historic season with $25 million Tour Championship win,2024-09-02,Jack Bantock,"Scottie Scheffler is tired. After the year he’s had, can anyone really blame him?

The world No. 1 capped off a year in equal parts historic and haywire with triumph at the season-ending Tour Championship on Sunday, cruising to a four-shot victory in Atlanta.

Having begun the week with a two-stroke lead at the summit on 10-under par, a reward for his position atop the FedEx Cup standings, the American eased around East Lake with a closing four-under 67 to beat compatriot Collin Morikawa to the $25 million winner’s cut of a $100 million prize purse.

It marks the first time since Tiger Woods in 2007 that a player has tallied seven wins in a PGA Tour season, a haul made even more impressive when you add in the Olympic gold, a newborn son and the mid-major arrest that headlined Scheffler’s stunning campaign.

“I feel like I’ve lived almost a full lifetime in this one year,” Scheffler told reporters. “It’s been nuts.”

“I’m exhausted right now,” he added. “There’s really no other way around it. I’m just really, really tired.”

A golden year

Scheffler’s starting advantage at East Lake was his reward for a stellar campaign.

The 28-year-old looked almost unbeatable during a prolific early season run, becoming the first player to ever defend The Players Championship before victory at the RBC Heritage in April – just one week on from clinching his second Masters title at Augusta National – made it four wins in five starts.

His greatest prize followed mere weeks later, as wife Meredith gave birth to the couple’s first child, Bennett. Their son arrived just in time for the PGA Championship, where the Texan was subsequently arrested amid remarkable scenes in Louisville.

The tournament favorite had warmed up in a jail cell after he was arrested driving around a police roadblock outside Valhalla Golf Club. Though the week ended in frustration on the course, with Scheffler finishing eight shots behind victor Xander Schauffele, all charges were dismissed a fortnight later.

Scheffler rebounded to add two more wins at the Memorial Tournament and Travelers Championship respectively before a stunning nine-under par final round at Le Golf National in Paris last month saw him clinch Olympic gold.

“I think when you hear people chanting ‘U-S-A’, even though it’s been over a month now since it happened … It’s pretty cool,” Scheffler said.

“I take a lot of pride in being an American, so it was pretty fun to bring home that gold medal. As far as the year goes, I really don’t know how to put it into words.

“You had the one weird spot there at Valhalla – I just don’t really know what to say about it – but everything else has been pretty special,” he added.

‘Just nothing fazes him’

It looked set to be a procession before Scheffler made a string of uncharacteristic errors towards the end of his front nine, starting with a skewed drive at the seventh that left him needing to escape from under a tree.

That led to a bogey that was replicated at the following hole when the leader shanked his effort from a greenside bunker, opening the door for a flying Morikawa to move within two strokes.

Fittingly for the season, any murmur of tension was immediately wiped out by Scheffler, who rattled off three consecutive birdies before lasering in for eagle at the par-five 15th to canter home ahead of world No. 4 Morikawa.

“Just nothing fazes him,” Morikawa, who pocketed $12.5 million, reflected to reporters about Scheffler.

“Whether I was close in gaining some ground or he was gaining ground, it didn’t change how he walked, how he played or how he went through every shot. That’s something to learn. I think his mental game is a lot stronger than a lot of people know.

“It’s amazing what he’s been able to do for this entire season and over these past three years. It’s been really cool to watch him, and hopefully, I can draw something from that.”

Attention for both Morikawa and Scheffler will now turn to the Presidents Cup, with both players automatically qualified for US captain Jim Furyk’s team that will take on Mike Weir’s international side at Royal Montreal Golf Club in Quebec, Canada, on September 24.

Scheffler was part of a victorious US team at Quail Hollow, North Carolina, two years ago but struggled individually, losing three of his four matches.

“Emotionally right now, I’m pretty drained, so I’m looking forward to going home and getting rest for a week or so before I start prepping for the Presidents Cup because that’s a tournament that I really want us to go out there and win,” Scheffler said."
sport,Scottie Scheffler caps historic season with $25 million Tour Championship win,2024-09-02,Jack Bantock,"Scottie Scheffler is tired. After the year he’s had, can anyone really blame him?

The world No. 1 capped off a year in equal parts historic and haywire with triumph at the season-ending Tour Championship on Sunday, cruising to a four-shot victory in Atlanta.

Having begun the week with a two-stroke lead at the summit on 10-under par, a reward for his position atop the FedEx Cup standings, the American eased around East Lake with a closing four-under 67 to beat compatriot Collin Morikawa to the $25 million winner’s cut of a $100 million prize purse.

It marks the first time since Tiger Woods in 2007 that a player has tallied seven wins in a PGA Tour season, a haul made even more impressive when you add in the Olympic gold, a newborn son and the mid-major arrest that headlined Scheffler’s stunning campaign.

“I feel like I’ve lived almost a full lifetime in this one year,” Scheffler told reporters. “It’s been nuts.”

“I’m exhausted right now,” he added. “There’s really no other way around it. I’m just really, really tired.”

A golden year

Scheffler’s starting advantage at East Lake was his reward for a stellar campaign.

The 28-year-old looked almost unbeatable during a prolific early season run, becoming the first player to ever defend The Players Championship before victory at the RBC Heritage in April – just one week on from clinching his second Masters title at Augusta National – made it four wins in five starts.

His greatest prize followed mere weeks later, as wife Meredith gave birth to the couple’s first child, Bennett. Their son arrived just in time for the PGA Championship, where the Texan was subsequently arrested amid remarkable scenes in Louisville.

The tournament favorite had warmed up in a jail cell after he was arrested driving around a police roadblock outside Valhalla Golf Club. Though the week ended in frustration on the course, with Scheffler finishing eight shots behind victor Xander Schauffele, all charges were dismissed a fortnight later.

Scheffler rebounded to add two more wins at the Memorial Tournament and Travelers Championship respectively before a stunning nine-under par final round at Le Golf National in Paris last month saw him clinch Olympic gold.

“I think when you hear people chanting ‘U-S-A’, even though it’s been over a month now since it happened … It’s pretty cool,” Scheffler said.

“I take a lot of pride in being an American, so it was pretty fun to bring home that gold medal. As far as the year goes, I really don’t know how to put it into words.

“You had the one weird spot there at Valhalla – I just don’t really know what to say about it – but everything else has been pretty special,” he added.

sport,Can golf be cool? This luxury fashion brand insists it can,2024-08-22,Jack Bantock,"Golf’s first superstar, Bobby Jones, once described the sport as “the closest game to the game we call life.” Decades later, golf is being compared to broccoli.

The analogy is being made by the co-founder of Whim Golf, a luxury apparel brand and design studio encouraging those with no interest in the game to – quite literally – try their greens.

“People don’t try golf the same way they don’t try broccoli, because they don’t think that they’re going to like it,” co-founderColin Heaberg told CNN.

“How do you get people to try something they think they don’t like?”

Whim is looking to inject a fresh perspective into golf. Whim Golf

“A little different”

Addressing that question has been Whim’s primary objective since Heaberg and business partner Will Gisel founded what was initially a boutique fashion brand in July 2019.

Clothes have been the primary answer, with a pop-up shop in Chicago marking the company’s launch. There, potential customers could peruse a range of “classic American sportswear;” button-down shirts, polos, shorts and more.

None of the items on the racks would have looked wildly out of place on the fairway, yet the intention was never to reinvent the wheel. Instead, Whim was targeting a specifically broad target market: “People who like X, Y, Z – and golf.”

“There’s a lot of people for whom golf is their whole personality, but for a lot of people who are interested in our brand, they have a whole other set of interests,” Heaberg explained.

“There’s plenty of people who buy our stuff who are never going to play golf, but they just like how we do it. A lot of the clothes that we’re making are pretty approachable – we’re not making the craziest Rick Owens polo or something like that. We’re making pretty good, clean stuff – just a little different.”

Just how different Whim can be while working around a sporting style that – even the most die-hard golfer will likely admit – has a reputation for strict monotony is a dilemma that its founders wrestle with regularly.

Outliers exist, and seem to be emerging with increasingly regularity: golf-mad rapper Macklemore launched clothing line Bogey Boys in 2021 to satiate players who “want to stick out,” an aim Australia’s Jason Day met emphatically at this year’s Masters, in April, when he teed up at Augusta National in an eye-catching sleeveless jumper designed by lifestyle brand Malbon Golf.

Even so, Heaberg remains “uninterested” in the wardrobe choices of the game’s top players. Here, he uses another analogy, about fashion outside of golf.“If you’re looking at the best style, you’re not going to just be looking at movie stars – Ryan Gosling – those people, they just don’t have it,” he said.

The fact that Day was subsequently asked to remove his flamboyant top by Masters officials is testament to Heaberg’s belief that much of golf continues to operate according to a rigid dress code.

“I think it’s hard to make actual market change because the rest of the market thinks that there’s nothing wrong with what they’re currently doing, and are not comfortable with change,” he reflected.

“We’ve always tried to be really constructive about it and not tell people like, ‘We hate your pink striped polo. “We’re like, ‘That’s cool, but this stuff also works.’”

“Free Golf”

Yet what truly separates Whim from other brands is what lies underfoot at the seven pop-ups it hasopened across its five-year history.

Each store is fitted with fully playable putting greens made from artificial turf, free to play for passers-by in any of the major cities they have sprung up in, including New York and Los Angeles. Over 15,000 people have been welcomed to the game at their installations.

Whim has expanded to an online shop, produced “countless” art pieces, sold directly to country clubs, and last month unveiled a sneaker collaboration with sportswear giant Reebok – “a dream fulfilled” for Heaberg. Yet clothes are merely the “carrot” to get people, especially those in urban areas, to pick up a club and hole their first putt.

“Everybody jumps like a kid when they finally do the thing that they’ve been trying to do and it works. That’s why we’re doing it – just to really expose people,” he said.

“A little girl gets on the bus and sees a soccer field or a basketball court and sees people doing that, and they tell their parents, ‘I wanna do that.’ If you don’t see golf, it’s hard to know you want to do it.

“Just let people see the thing, and the more you see it, the more you can see yourself within it.”

The putting green installations, dubbed the “Free Golf Initiative,” are part of the brand’s aim to “democratize” a sport that they say has “been held hostage by the general public’s misconceptions over who belongs in the game.”

The ultimate goal: convert as many golfers as possible between the ages of 18 and 34 so that, in a decade’s time, their children can lead a “youth movement” in the sport.

“You’d hear all this stuff about ‘grow the game’ and all these insider golf people would kind of have this lip service about how they’re trying to make it a more diverse and welcoming place,” Heaberg said.

“And we would always just be like, ‘You guys are just not doing anything, though.

You’ve got to do the work.’ We can’t just hire some diversity on the business and be like, ‘Alright, we did it!’ You’ve got to really get out there and put clubs in people’s hands.

“That’s the only metric there is – how many people are touching clubs?”"

sport,Keegan Bradley on his breathless turn from outsider to Ryder Cup captain: ‘I felt like having friends was going to hurt me’,2024-08-30,"Don Riddell, Jack Bantock","Major champion, seven-time PGA Tour winner, Ryder Cup captain – Keegan Bradley’s career CV is already the kind most golfers would take in a heartbeat, but that hasn’t stopped the American from harboring regrets.

Among the biggest of them all? Not making friends.

“I just came to the course every day and did my job. I felt like having friends was going to hurt me somehow,” Bradley told CNN Sport’s Don Riddell ahead of the PGA Tour’s season-ending Tour Championship in Atlanta this week.

“That’s something this generation of players don’t do – they’re all friends and it makes life more fun out here … Something I’ve tried to do a lot more of over the last handful of years is to get to know these guys and hang out with them because they’re such great guys.”

What brought on such introspection? In truth, there have been scant opportunities for self-reflection in a truly breathless 12 months for the 38-year-old.

Just under than a year ago, Bradley was licking painful wounds following his surprise omission from Zach Johnson’s Ryder Cup-losing team. On Sunday, he was toasting victory at the BMW Championship – a tournament he had qualified for in the last spot on the field – six weeks on from being unveiled as a similarly shocking selection for captain at next year’s biennial competition in New York.

Many had expected Tiger Woods to replace Johnson, heavily scrutinized after a bruising 11.5 – 16.5 defeat in Rome. When Bradley was ushered in as the leading man for Bethpage Black in September next year, nobody was more shocked than the man himself.

“I have no idea how it happened,” Bradley recalled to CNN. “I wasn’t involved in any of the conversations.”

“When I felt the extreme support from the players of me being the captain, it was one of the proudest moments of my life.”

Bradley’s pride served as a stark contrast to the intense hurt felt at missing out on last year’s team.

The 2011 PGA Championship winner was one of several players to miss out on a call-up as a captain’s pick despite accumulating more qualification points than Justin Thomas, whose struggles for form saw him ranked 15th in points at the time of selection.

Dubbed the team’s “emotional leader” by Johnson, Thomas was well-known to be close with Jordan Spieth and other members of the US roster. It left Bradley to reflect on his own reluctance to make friendships earlier in his career, as well as the emotional toll that his “obsession” to make the team had taken.

“I vowed to myself never to be that stressed out about making another team,” Bradley said.

“When you don’t make the team on points, you can’t expect to be picked, so I had no hard feelings. I was bummed out, certainly, but you’ve got to make that team in the top six to not be worried about making it.”

Dilemma

Having vowed to use that pain as motivation, Bradley has played some of the best golf of his career in 2024.

After two runner-up finishes, a one-shot victory over compatriot Sam Burns at the BMW Championship lifted him to world No. 11 – one shy of his career-best ranking achieved in 2013.

It emboldens his chances of making Jim Furyk’s team for the Presidents Cup in Montreal, Canada, next month, while also increasing the possibility of a potentially torturous dilemma: could Bradley be put in a position where he is picking himself for his own Ryder Cup team?

Not since Arnold Palmer powered the US to a resounding 23-9 victory in Atlanta in 1963 has there been a playing captain at the tournament. If Bradley, currently ranked 26th in qualification points, was to finish inside the automatic top six spots, he believes he would “certainly have to play.”

Anything less and it would have to be an “overwhelming consensus” among team and captains for Bradley to both play and captain. To do so would be a “dream situation” for the Vermont-born golfer, searching for his first taste of Ryder Cup triumph after defeat in 2012 and 2014.

“I want the best for the team no matter what that is,” he said.

“If me playing hurts the team then that’s not something I want to do. If me just being the captain makes this team better or helps the team, that’s what I want to do.

“It could be I’m nowhere near making the team and this conversation means nothing, but certainly I hope I’ve put myself in that position to be on the team.”"

sport,Victor Adeboyejo: ‘Pretty hefty sneeze’ rules soccer player out with injury,2024-09-06,Jamie Barton,"A soccer player in England has been ruled out with an injury after a “pretty hefty sneeze,” according to his head coach.

Victor Adeboyejo – who plays for Bolton Wanderers in League One, the third tier of English soccer – hurt his back due to the sneeze on Monday.

“Victor has been suffering with a nasty back injury and a sneeze set it off yesterday, believe it or not,” Bolton manager Ian Evatt told The Bolton News on Tuesday.

“We have had it scanned and should have the results very soon. Everyone remembers the challenge at Charlton, he was okay at the time. But then he had a pretty hefty sneeze,” he added.

“Victor is a powerful boy and even his sneezes are powerful!”

As a result, the Nigerian striker missed Tuesday’s game against Barrow, and it remains to be seen when he will make his return.

“He felt a bit of a crack in between his ribs and we are hopeful it is just a cartilage or muscular issue, but until we’ve had a good look at the scan, we won’t know,” Evatt said.

“I have to start having a long look at myself when players start getting injured sneezing. That is just the way things seem to be going at the moment, but we have to deal with it.”

The freak injury has come at a bad time for Bolton, which is already missing a number of other players and is struggling in the division following its loss to Oxford United in the play-off final last season.

Adeboyejo becomes the latest name on a list of the sport’s most bizarre injuries. In 2009, Glasgow Rangers defender Kirk Broadfoot required hospital treatment after an egg he had poached in his microwave exploded and scalded his face.

In 1995, meanwhile, Croatian striker Milan Rapaić missed the start of the preseason having accidentally poked himself in the eye with his boarding pass while waiting for a flight.

More recently, Tunisian Rami Kaib was sidelined for five weeks in 2021 after he broke his jaw eating a carrot."

sport,China v. Japan: Chinese soccer team face fan backlash after humiliating World Cup Qualifier loss to arch-rivals,2024-09-06,Chris Lau,"Hong Kong CNN —

China’s men’s soccer team fell to a 7-0 loss to arch-rivals Japan on Thursday night, a startling new low for a soccer-obsessed nation where the game has been plagued by corruption scandals and ever-worsening performances.

Players in top European leagues led the way for Japan, with Liverpool’s Wataru Endo and Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma both scoring in the demolition at the Saitama Stadium, north of Tokyo, in 2026 World Cup final-round Asian qualifiers. Monaco’s Takumi Minamino also scored twice.

“This is humiliating,” one China fan wrote on social media platform Weibo, where the defeat has become a trending topic, garnering more than 460 million views by Friday morning.

That the defeat came at the hands of Japan adds to the agony for Chinese fans. Sporting rivalries between the two countries often bear the undertones of their historical relationship, strained by – among other sore points – Japan’s brutal occupation of China in the first half of the 20th century, and current disputes over the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyus.

“This is the most shameful day for Chinese football,” another fan wrote on Weibo after the defeat, calling it “a day that will always sting Chinese fans” and “a pain that can never be erased.”

Another angry fan called for the team to be dismissed, writing: “It’s hopeless… It should be abandoned!”

Over the past decade China’s soccer officials – as well as leader Xi Jinping – have voiced ambitions of breaking into the sport’s upper echelons, and the country’s domestic league became a magnet for big-name players.

But in recent years the Chinese Super League has lost its luster – in part because of a wider economic slowdown and the government’s extremely strict response to Covid – while the national team has struggled. Earlier this year the team crashed out in the group stage of the Asian Cup in Qatar, without scoring a goal in three matches.

Compounding those factors is a major corruption scandal.

In March, Chinese courts sentenced some of the country’s most prominent soccer officials to jail as part of an anti-graft crackdown. Those ensnared by the probe included ex-soccer association head Chen Xuyuan and Li Tie, a former English Premier League player for Everton and former China head coach.

During Thursday’s game, Japan – ranked 18th in the world – could call on several familiar faces playing in top soccer leagues overseas.

Joining Mitoma, Endo and Minamino on the scoresheet were Celtic’s Daizen Maeda, Reims’ Junya Ito, and Takefusa Kubo, who plays in Spain with Real Sociedad.

Former player Fan Zhiyi, dubbed a trailblazer for being one of the first Chinese who played in the English leagues in the 1990s, said the loss was predictable, but not to that extent.

“It’s hard for fans to accept that we lost like this,” the now soccer coach wrote on Weibo, adding that the result illustrates “the World Cup is too far away.”

Speaking after the game, Zhang Yuning, a forward for China, acknowledged the defeat, but pledged to improve in the next game.

“We need to address this so that we can play better when we are back at our home turf,” he said.

The Chinese team, ranked 87th in the world, will play Roberto Mancini’s Saudi Arabia on September 10 in Dalian."
sport,China v. Japan: Chinese soccer team face fan backlash after humiliating World Cup Qualifier loss to arch-rivals,2024-09-06,Chris Lau,"Hong Kong CNN —

China’s men’s soccer team fell to a 7-0 loss to arch-rivals Japan on Thursday night, a startling new low for a soccer-obsessed nation where the game has been plagued by corruption scandals and ever-worsening performances.

Players in top European leagues led the way for Japan, with Liverpool’s Wataru Endo and Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma both scoring in the demolition at the Saitama Stadium, north of Tokyo, in 2026 World Cup final-round Asian qualifiers. Monaco’s Takumi Minamino also scored twice.

“This is humiliating,” one China fan wrote on social media platform Weibo, where the defeat has become a trending topic, garnering more than 460 million views by Friday morning.

That the defeat came at the hands of Japan adds to the agony for Chinese fans. Sporting rivalries between the two countries often bear the undertones of their historical relationship, strained by – among other sore points – Japan’s brutal occupation of China in the first half of the 20th century, and current disputes over the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyus.

“This is the most shameful day for Chinese football,” another fan wrote on Weibo after the defeat, calling it “a day that will always sting Chinese fans” and “a pain that can never be erased.”

Another angry fan called for the team to be dismissed, writing: “It’s hopeless… It should be abandoned!”

sport,Alex Morgan: US soccer icon announces retirement from the sport,2024-09-05,David Close,"Alex Morgan, one of the most prolific goalscorers and well-known soccer stars in the world, announced her retirement from professional soccer on Thursday.

Morgan, a 35-year-old striker for the NWSL’s San Diego Wave, posted an emotional four-plus minute video on social media to state her last match will be this weekend against the North Carolina Courage.

Morgan also revealed she was pregnant with her second child during the video.

“Soccer has been a part of me for 30 years. It was one of the first things that I ever loved. And I gave everything to this sport. What I got in return was more than I could have ever dreamed of,” Morgan said.

Suiting up for the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT), Morgan is a two-time World Cup champion and won an Olympic gold medal in 2012.

“We’re changing lives and the impact we have on the next generation is irreversible and I’m proud in the hand I had in making that happen in pushing the game forward and leaving it in a place that I’m so happy and proud of,” she said.

She scored 123 goals for the US – ranking her fifth on the all-time USWNT list.

“Charlie [Morgan’s daughter] came up to me the other day and said that when she grows up, she wants to be a soccer player and it just made me like immensely proud, not because I wish for her to become a soccer player when she grows up, but because a pathway exists that even a four-year-old can see now,” Morgan said."

sport,Mohamed Salah: Liverpool star says it’s his ‘last year’ at club,2024-09-02,Ben Morse,"Liverpool star Mohamed Salah said this will be his “last year” with the Reds after playing a pivotal role in his team’s 3-0 thumping of Manchester United on Sunday.

Salah, 32, scored and provided two assists as Liverpool ran riot at Old Trafford against a lackluster United.

When asked afterwards what was behind his fast start to the new Premier League campaign – the Egyptian has scored three times and provided three assists in Liverpool’s opening three matches – Salah said he came in with less pressure on his shoulders.

“I had a good summer and had a long time to myself to try to stay positive because, as you know, it’s my last year at the club,” Salah told Sky Sports.

“I just want to enjoy it and I don’t want to think about it. I feel like I’m free to play football and then we’ll see what happens next year.”

Salah’s current contract runs out at the end of the 2024/25 season. He has been at Liverpool since 2017, scoring 160 Premier League goals along the way.

He has been subject to rumors of a move away from Anfield in recent years, with Liverpool reportedly rejecting a big-money offer from Saudi Arabia last year.

With questions swirling around his future, Salah said he has yet to talk to the club about a possible contract extension.

“Coming into the game, I said it could be the last time [I play here with Liverpool],” he said.

“No one at the club has spoken to me about contracts, so I’m just like, ‘OK, I’m playing my last season’ and see what happens at the end of the season.

“So far, we don’t know with which club, but so far yeah my last game here with Liverpool. It’s not up to me, but nobody talk to me about a contract with the club. We’ll see.”

When asked about Salah’s comments after the game, new Liverpool manager Arne Slot said he is focusing on the present.

“It’s a lot of ‘if’. At this moment, he is one of ours and I am really happy with him being one of ours and he played really well,” Slot told reporters, per Sky Sports.

“I don’t talk about contracts from players, but I can talk for hours about how Mo played today.”

Salah’s performance on Sunday continued his excellent record against Liverpool’s big rival, United.

He has scored 10 goals in nine appearances for Liverpool at Old Trafford, with the Reds sitting second in the Premier League, level on nine points with leader Manchester City after an unbeaten start to the season."

sport,USA’s Jessica Pegula ‘taking confidence’ from best-ever grand slam run despite defeat in US Open final,2024-09-08,Issy Ronald,"Jessica Pegula reached new heights in her already distinguished tennis career this week.

A serial winner of other tournaments on the WTA Tour and firmly ensconced in the top 10 of the world rankings, she had never quite been able to replicate that success in grand slams, until this week.

Until Wednesday, Pegula had lost all six of the grand slam quarterfinals she had played in, a streak she broke in impressive fashion by defeating world No. 1 Iga Świątek 6-2 6-4 at the 2024 US Open. Then, she defeated Karolína Muchová 1-6 6-4 6-2 in the semifinal to reach her first grand slam final and, though she lost to Aryna Sabalenka on Saturday evening, the American is “taking confidence” from this run.

“If I can’t take confidence from this, there’s got to be something wrong,” she told reporters in her post-match press conference. “To be able to be a grand slam finalist, that was kind of the last thing for me. I made a lot of quarterfinals but can I make a semi? Can I be a contender to actually win a grand slam.”

Playing Sabalenka, the world No. 2, in the final proved a step too far for Pegula as she succumbed to a 7-5 7-5 defeat. Although she fought back from 3-0 down in the second set and took a 5-3 lead, almost forcing the match to a deciding third set, Sabalenka displayed her quality and sealed the win.

“I’m just annoyed I lost right now,” Pegula said afterward. “Everyone is like, ‘Congrats, amazing tournament.’ I’m like, ‘Eh, whatever,’” she added, half joking.

Despite the defeat, Pegula will regain her career-high world No. 3 ranking after winning 15 of her last 17 matches, losing only to Sabalenka. Such a run comes after a year tarnished by injury in which she hadn’t made it past the second round of a grand slam.

“I think maybe I handled the moment a little bit better this year with just having maybe a different perspective of I had a rough start to the year and I didn’t really expect to be doing this well in the hard court swing and I was able to kind of flip that script,” she said.

Several celebrities, including Lewis Hamilton, Noah Lyles, Tina Fey, Rebel Wilson and Steph Curry, were all pictured in the stands of the Arthur Ashe Stadium enjoying the tennis.

Pegula added that Curry had given her a pep talk before Saturday’s final, though quipped that her husband was particularly excited to meet the NBA superstar.

“Funny story, my husband, his iPhone name is Steph Curry because he loves Steph Curry,” Pegula said. “If you connect to Bluetooth or send him something or AirDrop, it’s ‘Steph Curry’s iPhone’.

“I was like, ‘Please tell me you did not tell him about the iPhone thing.’ … He was like, ‘No, (Curry) loved it’. I was like, ‘Did he? Or did he really think you were kind of crazy?’ I guess he thought it was pretty funny.”"

sport,Lyudmyla Kichenok: This tennis player was supposed to be at her wedding. But winning the US Open women’s doubles title changed her plans,2024-09-08,Ben Morse,"Lyudmyla Kichenok’s time in New York for the US Open was supposed to be filled with tennis and capped off by her marriage to her partner, Stas Kumarsky, on the Wednesday of the second week of the grand slam.

But that schedule all changed when the Ukrainian player and her doubles partner Jelena Ostapenko kept on winning in the women’s doubles tournament.

So much so that they claimed the grand slam title on Friday, beating Kristina Mladenovic and Zhang Shuai in straight sets in the final in Arthur Ashe Stadium.

After claiming her maiden grand slam title, Kichenok revealed that Kumarsky – who is Ostapenko’s coach – had initially booked the wedding two days before the final for the pair to tie the knot but her success on the court curtailed that plan.

“We decided when we got here to New York, my boyfriend Stas, he checked where we can do it, because we got engaged more than a year ago,” the 32-year-old said on court after winning the women’s doubles title. “We were figuring out all the things, where we can do that. And, yeah, he found a spot here and he just booked an appointment for Wednesday.

“He told me that. I was, like: ‘Okay, yeah, let’s go.’ Just this procedure when you sign the papers, just to do that. Yeah, we actually set a date, but I had to play semifinals on Wednesday, and I said: ‘Okay, maybe next time.’”

Kichenok added that they will get married another time, hypothesizing that they will do it in either “Las Vegas or Europe somewhere.”

Kichenok and Ostapenko were dominant on their way to claiming the US Open women’s doubles title, not dropping a set all tournament.

It is their third title of the year, and afterwards, Kichenok dedicated the victory to the “people in Ukraine.”

“They are fighting very hard for our freedom right now and I just hope I can give them some encouragement. My heart is with them.”"

sport,Aryna Sabalenka wins US Open over American Jessica Pegula,2024-09-07,"Andy Scholes, Jill Martin","New York CNN —

Aryna Sabalenka would not be denied hoisting the US Open championship trophy this year.

Sabalenka, the world No. 2 from Belarus, defeated American Jessica Pegula 7-5, 7-5 at Arthur Ashe Stadium to win the US Open for the first time.

This is Sabalenka’s third career grand slam singles title, having won the Australian Open for the second consecutive year back in January. She’s the first woman to sweep the hard court grand slams since Angelique Kerber in 2016.

After winning championship point, Sabalenka fell to the court, overcome with emotion. She went on to thank the crowd for their support.

“You were cheering for me on those good moments,” Sabalenka said. “Of course I expected you to cheer for Jessica. I mean, that wouldn’t be normal if you would cheer for me, you know?”

This was the second year in a row Sabalenka reached the US Open final. A year ago, she lost to Coco Gauff, and the New York crowd was not on the Belarusian’s side, loudly pulling for the American.

“So many times I was so close to get a US Open title,” Sabalenka said, who also had heartbreaking losses in 2021 and 2022 in the semifinals. “It’s always been a dream of mine. Finally, I got this beautiful trophy.”

Sabalenka admitted the crowd affected her in that 2023 final – and she had resolved that wouldn’t happen to her again.

“I would say that this year, I felt so much love from the crowd,” Sabalenka told CNN. “Even though I was facing Americans, they still were supporting, cheering for me a little bit.

“I felt like last year there was kind of like close to zero on my side, and this year I felt a lot of support, even in the finals. I’m just super happy to feel so much love in New York.”

Sabalenka reflected on what her success meant to her. “Well, after I lost my father, it’s always been my goal to put our family name in the history of tennis,” she said.

“Every time I see my name on that trophy, I’m so proud of myself, I’m proud of my family that they never gave up on my dream and that they were doing everything they could to keep me going.”

Sabalenka, 26, has now won 12 consecutive matches and improves her head-to-head record against Pegula to 6-2.

While the scoreline was straight sets, it wasn’t exactly straightforward.

Sabalenka led by a set and 3-0, but Pegula went on to win the next five games to give the American a 5-3 second-set lead.

Sabalenka would not give Pegula a chance to force a third set, however, winning the next four games to close out the match.

Sabalenka was asked how she was going to celebrate with her team. “A lot of drinks,” she said to CNN. “I need to feel this relief. I hope we’re going to have a lot of fun with my team.”

Pegula, meanwhile, had made a breakthrough at this year’s US Open. Previously, the 30-year-old’s best result at a major was reaching the quarterfinals, where she had been 0-6 at that stage. With her result in New York, she will rise from No. 6 to No. 3 in the world, matching her career-high ranking.

Pegula had missed a portion of the schedule earlier this season, including the French Open, because of injury. But during the North American hard court swing this summer, Pegula found her stride, going 15-2.

Those two losses were to Sabalenka: in the Cincinnati Open final last month and Saturday in her first grand slam singles final.

“It’s been an incredible month for me, really,” Pegula said. “I had a rough start to the year but was really able to turn it around. To be able to be standing here in my first grand slam final, and then coming off such a hot summer, I didn’t expect it. I’m just really grateful for the last few weeks of tennis and some incredible matches I’ve been able to put together.”

Pegula, who is a Buffalo native, is the daughter of Terry and Kim Pegula, owners of the NFL’s Buffalo Bills and NHL’s Buffalo Sabres. She was introduced to tennis by her family at age 7, and she recently said getting to the US Open final was “a childhood dream.”

When Pegula entered the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium for the final, she notably removed her headphones, appearing to soak in the crowd noise after she had been introduced."

Pegula had missed a portion of the schedule earlier this season, including the French Open, because of injury. But during the North American hard court swing this summer, Pegula found her stride, going 15-2.

Those two losses were to Sabalenka: in the Cincinnati Open final last month and Saturday in her first grand slam singles final.

“It’s been an incredible month for me, really,” Pegula said. “I had a rough start to the year but was really able to turn it around. To be able to be standing here in my first grand slam final, and then coming off such a hot summer, I didn’t expect it. I’m just really grateful for the last few weeks of tennis and some incredible matches I’ve been able to put together.”

Pegula, who is a Buffalo native, is the daughter of Terry and Kim Pegula, owners of the NFL’s Buffalo Bills and NHL’s Buffalo Sabres. She was introduced to tennis by her family at age 7, and she recently said getting to the US Open final was “a childhood dream.”

When Pegula entered the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium for the final, she notably removed her headphones, appearing to soak in the crowd noise after she had been introduced."
sport,Sara Errani celebrates ‘unbelievable’ year with US Open mixed doubles win,2024-09-06,George Ramsay,"Weeks after becoming an Olympic gold medalist, Sara Errani continued her sensational year on the tennis court with victory in the US Open mixed doubles alongside partner Andrea Vavassori.

The Italian pair defeated Americans Taylor Townsend and Donald Young on Thursday for their first mixed doubles title at a major tournament, triumphing 7-6(0), 7-5 in Arthur Ashe Stadium.

It was the latest victory in the 37-year-old Errani’s remarkable year after winning gold in the Olympic women’s doubles alongside Jasmine Paolini, while the duo also won the Italian Open together in May.

“It’s more than a dream; I never dreamed this, so it’s much more. It’s an unbelievable year,” Errani told reporters.

“I couldn’t expect this. I’m enjoying it a lot,” she added. “Of course, when you win, you enjoy it a lot. When you lose, not too much … I’m proud of myself to be there, to be there in the tough moment and to live these moments.”

Errani and Vavassori are the first Italian mixed doubles champions at the US Open and also denied Young a chance to win the final match of his career in front of a home crowd.

After trading breaks from 5-5, a close first set was settled when the Italians cruised through the tie-break to love. They then went 4-2 ahead in the second set before Townsend and Young broke Errani’s serve to stay in the match.

On-serve at the end of the second set, Errani and Vavassori engineered three championship points on Townsend’s serve, winning the third when the American netted a backhand.

The title is another achievement in what is turning out to be a remarkable year for Italian tennis. Jannik Sinner became the country’s first male grand slam singles winner in 48 years when he claimed the Australian Open title in January, before Paolini reached back-to-back finals at the French Open and Wimbledon.

“It’s an incredible year for me, but also for Italy … We are very happy to be in that moment,” said Errani, a five-time grand slam champion in women’s doubles.

For the 29-year-old Vavassori, this was the first grand slam title of his career having reached the finals of the Australian and French Opens in the men’s doubles earlier this year alongside compatriot Simone Bolelli.

“I always wanted to win a slam,” Vavassori told reporters. “Doubles, mixed, I don’t care … and winning something like this is unbelievable. To accomplish this with Sara is special because she’s a special person, I think.”

There could yet be more success for Italy in New York with world No. 1 Sinner competing in the semifinals against Britain’s Jack Draper on Friday, hoping to win his second grand slam of the year."

sport,Caitlin Clark becomes fastest WNBA player to reach 300 assists with a double-double in Indiana Fever comeback victory,2024-09-09,"Samuel Joseph, Sam Joseph","Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark achieved yet another WNBA milestone on Sunday, becoming the fastest player in league history to reach 300 career assists in her team’s 104-100 overtime win against the Atlanta Dream.

The 22-year-old scored 26 points and had 12 assists – along with five rebounds – in the Fever’s comeback victory to record her 14th double-double of the season, a franchise record. She also knocked down four three-pointers to take her season total to 111, extending the rookie record that she claimed at the end of August.

Clark’s performance marked an impressive night for the last three WNBA No.

1 draft picks. 2023 No. 1 overall selection Aliyah Boston led the Fever in scoring with a career-high 30 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, while the Dream’s Rhyne Howard – picked first in 2022 – exploded for 36 points.

Indiana struggled at times during the game and entered halftime having committed 12 turnovers to Atlanta’s one. The Dream opened up a 16-point advantage with just under seven minutes to go in the third quarter, but the Fever produced an 18-5 run to close the period, cutting the lead to three entering the fourth.

Atlanta stretched the lead to nine in the fourth quarter but was reeled in by Indiana once again, with a Boston layup off Clark’s 10th assist tying the game at 90 with 18 seconds left.

Overtime was needed to separate the two teams and the Fever eventually seized the advantage. Two free throws from Clark in the final seconds of the matchup iced the game and moved Indiana to 19-17 on the season.

“I thought we just kept chipping away, got stops when we needed to and then the crowd was amazing and helped us get it done,” Clark said on court postgame.

The Fever secured a playoff spot on September 3, marking their return to the postseason for the first time since 2016.

“Right now, we’re kind of in the space where we just have to make sure that we’re keeping our foot on the gas,” said Boston. “I think we know that we’re very capable of beating any single team, just because of the way we play, the pace that we play at, and just the weapons that we have all around the floor.

“Even if we’re down, no matter what the time of the game is, we’re very capable of coming back.”

The defeat was a blow to the Dream’s hopes of securing the league’s eighth and final playoff berth. Atlanta is now 12-23 and sits ninth in the overall WNBA standings, one game behind the Chicago Sky.

Tina Charles and Jordin Canada each added 17 points for the Dream, while Allisha Gray was the team’s fourth player in double figures with 15.

sport,Northern Illinois shocks No. 5 Notre Dame in ‘biggest upset’ in school’s history,2024-09-08,Ben Morse,"The Northern Illinois Huskies shocked No. 5 Notre Dame on Saturday in a dramatic upset result at Notre Dame Stadium.

Kanon Woodill’s 35-year field goal with 31 seconds left gave the Huskies a late two-point lead before Cade Haberman blocked Notre Dame’s attempted 62-yard field goal to clinch the 16-14 victory.

The victory is Northern Illinois’ first ever win over a top-five ranked opponent, with the NBC commentary team coining it the “biggest upset” in the school’s history.

“I’m so proud of the kids, our coaches, everybody, they believed,” an emotional Huskies head coach Thomas Hammock told NBC afterwards. “They believed and we came here and got it done.

“They listened to what I said, I told them all week: ‘We don’t need luck, we just need to be our best,’ and they were their best today.”

The Fighting Irish had taken the lead on Saturday, but the Huskies answered in impressive fashion with a 83-yard touchdown pass from Ethan Hampton to Antario Brown and two field goals from Woodill to give them a six-point advantage.

A 34-yard touchdown run from Jeremiyah Love handed Notre Dame a one-point lead midway through the third quarter.

And trailing with just under six minutes remaining of the game, Northern Illinois got the ball back when Amariyun Knighten intercepted Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard and returned it 30 yards to Notre Dame’s 50-yard line.

The team drove down the field, converting two third downs and a fourth down along the way, until they reached the Fighting Irish’s 19-yard line.

Woodill successfully converted the field goal, his third of the afternoon, to leave Notre Dame just seconds to attempt a comeback.

They managed to reach Northern Illinois’ 44-yard line before the drive stalled, leaving them with a 62-yard field goal attempt and just five seconds remaining.

But Haberman was able to get his hand to the attempt from by Notre Dame’s Mitch Jeter, his second block of the day, sparking wild scenes of celebration as the Northern Illinois players and coaches spilled onto the field.

It is the first win by any Mid-American Conference team over a team ranked in the Associated Press top five.

Hammock spoke afterwards on why the victory was so special to him.

“All these guys that have been with our program, been through the ups and downs and they continue to fight,” he said as his voice cracked with emotion. “It’s like they’re my kids! I’m happy for the adversity, to push through no matter the situation and I just couldn’t be more proud.”"

sport,Angel Reese will miss rest of WNBA season because of wrist injury,2024-09-07,"Jacob Lev, Jill Martin","Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese, the WNBA leader this season in total rebounds per game and offensive rebounds per game, will miss the rest of the season because of a wrist injury.

The Sky made the announcement Saturday night. It’s a big blow for Chicago, who currently are in the eighth and final playoff spot, with the Atlanta Dream, Washington Mystics and Dallas Wings still in the hunt.

The Sky have six regular-season games left.

“What a year. I never would have imagined the last bucket of my rookie season would be a 3 but maybe that was God saying give them a taste of what they will be seeing more of in Year 2 lol,” said Reese in posts on X and Instagram, referencing the three-point shot she hit during the fourth quarter Friday in her team’s 92-78 win against the Los Angeles Sparks.

“Through it all, I have showed that I belong in this league even when no one else believed. All I have ever wanted was to come into the W and make an impact. I can confidently say I have done that and will strive to keep doing so. I’m filled with emotions right now that I have a season ending injury, but also filled with so much gratitude for what is next.”

In Friday’s win against the Sparks, Reese finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds. She has averaged 13.6 points and 13.1 rebounds per game this season.

“Although this is God’s timing and not mine, I am finally able to give myself a physical and mental break. God gives his hardest battles to his strongest soldiers,” Reese said.

Reese, who was drafted with the seventh overall pick in this year’s WNBA draft, was no stranger to making history in her rookie season.

On September 1, the former Louisiana State University star broke the WNBA’s single-season record for rebounds, passing Sylvia Fowles, who retired after the 2022 season as the league’s career leader in rebounds.

Reese also broke the single-season record for offensive rebounds, while she has already become the fastest player in WNBA history to record 20 double-doubles and racked up the most consecutive double-doubles (15) in league history.

Reese tallied 26 double-doubles on the season, becoming just one of two players in league history to do so in one year."

science,How Xs and Cs spotted in the ionosphere could disrupt life on Earth,2024-08-02,Ashley Strickland,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Each day, radio signals from key communications and navigation satellites travel freely through a layer of Earth’s atmosphere known as the ionosphere.

Floating 50 to 400 miles (80 to 643 kilometers) above our heads, directly beneath the lowest reaches of space where some communications satellites orbit, this zone in the upper atmosphere is also home to many unsolved puzzles — including an alphabet-shaped one that has the potential to thwart all that those radio signals do to keep life on our planet running smoothly.

Processes in the ionosphere can create bright swaths of color in the sky, known as airglow, as seen here from the International Space Station. NASA SVS

Astronomers have known for some time that X-shaped crestlike formations can appear in the ionosphere’s plasma — a sea of charged particles — after solar storms.

Volcanic events and extreme weather on Earth can also cause the phenomenon. Huge eruptions, such as the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai eruption in January 2022, loft particles into Earth’s atmosphere that even reach space. Thunderstorms and hurricanes can create pressure waves that find their way to the ionosphere.

Meanwhile, at night during these active periods, when the sun’s radiation isn’t as strong, is also when low-density bubbles appear in the ionosphere.

Satellite data hasn’t always been able to capture the full picture of what’s occurring in the ionosphere, but NASA’s GOLD mission has a bird’s-eye view of the atmospheric layer over the Western Hemisphere from space, revealing how different factors cause disturbances in the ionosphere.

Now, astronomers looking at data collected by the GOLD mission have found similar features shaped like Xs and never-before-seen Cs that surprisingly seem to have appeared during “quiet times” when there were no atmospheric disturbances, according to new research. The findings are upending what’s known about how the unusual structures might form and their potential impacts.

The mission’s data is helping scientists to see “how complex Earth’s atmosphere is” while showing that it’s more variable than expected, even when there isn’t an obvious cause behind the alphabet-shaped disturbances in the ionosphere, said Jeffrey Klenzing, a research scientist who studies the ionosphere at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

“I would suspect that it’s always been happening,” he said. “And really the issue has basically been that we haven’t had enough data to really see that it is happening.”

Gaining a better understanding of the letter-shaped phenomena may help scientists unlock the dynamics between the ionosphere and weather — and how the interplay may pose risks to people and systems on Earth.

X-shaped crests

The ionosphere is not always a perfectly smooth layer of gas, and it’s constantly changing. It becomes electrified when sunlight hits it. Solar radiation knocks electrons off atoms and molecules to create plasma that allows radio communications to travel over long distances.

But as the sun fades away at night, the ionosphere thins out and the once-charged particles settle down and become neutral particles, according to NASA. This is when bubbles can form in the ionosphere.

Earth’s magnetic field lines also carry charged particles free-floating in the atmosphere to two dense bands north and south of the equator that are known as crests.

Earth’s electric and magnetic fields and gravity cause charged particles in the ionosphere to flow away from Earth’s magnetic equator. These motions form two crests to the north and south of the equator. NASA SVS

Given their various densities, crests and bubbles resembling different shapes within the ionosphere can cause interference with communication and GPS signals.

The GOLD, or Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk, mission has been monitoring the ionosphere since it launched in January 2018. The satellite zips around Earth at the same rate that our planet rotates, enabling the spacecraft to remain in a constant hover over the Western Hemisphere.

GOLD spotted the clearest signs of the X- and C-shaped features in 2019, 2020 and 2021 — and in unexpected places. The evidence is causing researchers to question the potential effects of the Xs and Cs on communication signals in the future.

“NASA’s GOLD mission is the first one to observe the alphabetical shapes unambiguously,” said Fazlul Laskar, lead author of an April study about the X shapes published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.

“These shapes reveal that the ionosphere can be very dynamic at times displaying unexpected structures,” added Laskar, a research scientist at the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. “Also, it demonstrates that the lower atmospheric weather could have enormous impact on the ionosphere.”

A bright, horizontal X-shaped feature was observed in the ionosphere on October 7, 2019. NASA SVS

GOLD observing multiple instances of the Xs forming “during geomagnetic quiet conditions” — instead of during atmospheric disturbances such as solar storms or terrestrial weather, when they were previously seen — now tells scientists some other mechanism must be responsible for forming the shapes, Laskar said. Computer models point to changes in the lower atmosphere pulling plasma downward as a possible explanation, according to the study.

“The (appearance of the) X is odd because it implies that there are far more localized driving factors,” Klenzing said. He was not involved in the April study. “This is expected during the extreme events, but seeing it during ‘quiet time’ suggests that the lower atmosphere activity is significantly driving the ionospheric structure.”

Never-before-seen C bubbles

Separately, GOLD also observed C-shaped plasma bubbles that may be influenced by other factors.

Typically, plasma bubbles are long and straight because they form along Earth’s magnetic field lines. But some of the bubbles resemble curved shapes, which look like Cs or reverse Cs, and scientists think they could be shaped by Earth’s winds.

While C shapes may form if winds increase with altitude, reverse Cs could form if winds decrease with altitude, according to research models.

“It’s a little like a tree growing in a windy area,” Klenzing said. “If the winds are typically to the east, the tree starts to tilt and grow in that direction.”

But GOLD observed C-shaped and reverse C-shaped plasma bubbles unusually close together, only about 400 miles (644 kilometers) apart, or the about distance between Baltimore and Boston, according to a November 2023 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.

“Within that close proximity, these two opposite-shaped plasma bubbles had never been thought of, never been imaged,” said Deepak Karan, research scientist at the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. Karan works on the GOLD mission and is the lead author of the C-shape study and coauthor of the X-shape study.

Tornado-like activity, wind shear or a vortex could be creating turbulence in the atmosphere that causes changing wind patterns in such a small area, Karan said. But they never expected to see such oppositely structured bubbles so close together.

“The fact that we have very different shapes of bubbles this close together tells us that the dynamics of the atmosphere is more complex than we expected,” Klenzing said.

So far, GOLD has only observed two instances of the close pairings, but the C-shaped bubbles have the potential to disrupt communications.

“It’s really important to find out why this is happening,” Karan said. “If a vortex or a very strong shear in the plasma has happened, this will completely distort the plasma over that region. Signals will be lost completely with a strong disturbance like this.”

Karan said these vortices, which can last for hours, resemble tornadoes that occur in Earth’s lower atmosphere, but the puzzle scientists can’t seem to solve is how the structures form in the ionosphere during “quiet time.”

“Unraveling the mystery of these plasma bubble formations is not only a scientific curiosity but also of practical importance for mitigating the adverse effects on communication and navigation systems,” he said.

Attempts to understand how the bubbles form so close together with current modeling tools has been unsuccessful, Karan said. It is his hope that by publishing the research and including all possible formation mechanisms, the scientific community can come together to solve the mystery.

A golden trove of data

The GOLD mission is well suited to capture unexpected features in the ionosphere because of its orbit. While previous satellite missions could only capture a small piece of an event in one dimension, GOLD can take multiple images of an event over the course of hours, Laskar said. And he expects even more surprising features to be revealed in GOLD’s data in the future.

“Due to such wide view and continuous measurements, GOLD has allowed us to observe these mysteries within the ionosphere,” Karan said.

He said there are many questions that remain unanswered about this atmospheric layer, such as how changes in the lower atmosphere and solar activity influence the motion of charged particles in the ionosphere.

Given that solar storms could increase due to the sun approaching the peak of its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum, astronomers also want to have a better understanding of how the ionosphere’s composition changes during the events because sudden swells of charged particles can increase drag on satellites and shorten their lifespans, Karan said.

Electric currents also flow in the ionosphere, and an increase in the electric current during solar storms can damage transmission lines and ground transformers on Earth, he said.

During the May 10 geomagnetic storm that hit Earth, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption.

“The biggest impact to the agriculture industry centered on GPS guidance systems,” said Tim Marquis, a senior product manager at John Deere, in a statement. “GPS receivers work when a signal is received at regular intervals, much like a beat from a metronome, from a satellite in orbit. During solar storms, that signal hits a ‘fog’ of charged particles and can be lost. And machines can’t know precisely where they are thanks to this interference.”

Pending results from studies of GOLD data during the May 10 geomagnetic storm could help astronomers in the development of a space weather forecasting system, Laskar said.

“One thing we need to have is a space weather forecasting system that could tell us when we are going to have problems with GPS signals and when satellite orbits may need to be adjusted to avoid catastrophic collisions,” he said.

Losing a GPS signal on Earth isn’t just annoying for people trying to find a location they’ve never been to. The navigation signals are widely used in shipping, transportation, agriculture and construction, too.

When bubbles, crests or solar storms disrupt the plasma distribution in the ionosphere, radio signals passing through the atmospheric layer can be changed, lost or fade away, Karan said.

“There could be life-threatening impacts due to the sudden loss of GPS signals in aircraft, ships, and automobiles which is even scary to imagine,” he said.

GOLD and future mission concepts could help scientists to better understand the phenomena at work behind these recently observed X and C features — and even perhaps predict such changes before they occur in the ionosphere.

“One of the challenges for ionospheric researchers is to eventually be able to predict its dynamics in advance,” Laskar said, “so that we can be prepared for GPS signal loss and interruptions to satellite communications.”"

Each day, radio signals from key communications and navigation satellites travel freely through a layer of Earth’s atmosphere known as the ionosphere.

Floating 50 to 400 miles (80 to 643 kilometers) above our heads, directly beneath the lowest reaches of space where some communications satellites orbit, this zone in the upper atmosphere is also home to many unsolved puzzles — including an alphabet-shaped one that has the potential to thwart all that those radio signals do to keep life on our planet running smoothly.

Astronomers have known for some time that X-shaped crestlike formations can appear in the ionosphere’s plasma — a sea of charged particles — after solar storms.

Volcanic events and extreme weather on Earth can also cause the phenomenon. Huge eruptions, such as the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai eruption in January 2022, loft particles into Earth’s atmosphere that even reach space. Thunderstorms and hurricanes can create pressure waves that find their way to the ionosphere.

Meanwhile, at night during these active periods, when the sun’s radiation isn’t as strong, is also when low-density bubbles appear in the ionosphere.

Satellite data hasn’t always been able to capture the full picture of what’s occurring in the ionosphere, but NASA’s GOLD mission has a bird’s-eye view of the atmospheric layer over the Western Hemisphere from space, revealing how different factors cause disturbances in the ionosphere.

Now, astronomers looking at data collected by the GOLD mission have found similar features shaped like Xs and never-before-seen Cs that surprisingly seem to have appeared during “quiet times” when there were no atmospheric disturbances, according to new research. The findings are upending what’s known about how the unusual structures might form and their potential impacts.

The mission’s data is helping scientists to see “how complex Earth’s atmosphere is” while showing that it’s more variable than expected, even when there isn’t an obvious cause behind the alphabet-shaped disturbances in the ionosphere, said Jeffrey Klenzing, a research scientist who studies the ionosphere at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

“I would suspect that it’s always been happening,” he said. “And really the issue has basically been that we haven’t had enough data to really see that it is happening.”

Gaining a better understanding of the letter-shaped phenomena may help scientists unlock the dynamics between the ionosphere and weather — and how the interplay may pose risks to people and systems on Earth.

X-shaped crests

The ionosphere is not always a perfectly smooth layer of gas, and it’s constantly changing. It becomes electrified when sunlight hits it. Solar radiation knocks electrons off atoms and molecules to create plasma that allows radio communications to travel over long distances.

But as the sun fades away at night, the ionosphere thins out and the once-charged particles settle down and become neutral particles, according to NASA. This is when bubbles can form in the ionosphere.

Earth’s magnetic field lines also carry charged particles free-floating in the atmosphere to two dense bands north and south of the equator that are known as crests.

Earth’s electric and magnetic fields and gravity cause charged particles in the ionosphere to flow away from Earth’s magnetic equator. These motions form two crests to the north and south of the equator. NASA SVS

Given their various densities, crests and bubbles resembling different shapes within the ionosphere can cause interference with communication and GPS signals.

The GOLD, or Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk, mission has been monitoring the ionosphere since it launched in January 2018. The satellite zips around Earth at the same rate that our planet rotates, enabling the spacecraft to remain in a constant hover over the Western Hemisphere.

GOLD spotted the clearest signs of the X- and C-shaped features in 2019, 2020 and 2021 — and in unexpected places. The evidence is causing researchers to question the potential effects of the Xs and Cs on communication signals in the future.

“NASA’s GOLD mission is the first one to observe the alphabetical shapes unambiguously,” said Fazlul Laskar, lead author of an April study about the X shapes published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.

“These shapes reveal that the ionosphere can be very dynamic at times displaying unexpected structures,” added Laskar, a research scientist at the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. “Also, it demonstrates that the lower atmospheric weather could have enormous impact on the ionosphere.”

GOLD observing multiple instances of the Xs forming “during geomagnetic quiet conditions” — instead of during atmospheric disturbances such as solar storms or terrestrial weather, when they were previously seen — now tells scientists some other mechanism must be responsible for forming the shapes, Laskar said. Computer models point to changes in the lower atmosphere pulling plasma downward as a possible explanation, according to the study.

“The (appearance of the) X is odd because it implies that there are far more localized driving factors,” Klenzing said. He was not involved in the April study. “This is expected during the extreme events, but seeing it during ‘quiet time’ suggests that the lower atmosphere activity is significantly driving the ionospheric structure.”

science,Surprising element found in traces of Tycho Brahe’s alchemy lab confounds scientists,2024-07-27,Ashley Strickland,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

While Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe is best known for his celestial discoveries made in the 16th century — before the invention of the telescope — he was also an alchemist who brewed secret medicines for elite clients. But what exactly Brahe worked on in his alchemical laboratory, located beneath his castle residence and observatory called Uraniborg, has been something of a historical enigma.

The covert nature of Brahe’s work was common among alchemists of the Renaissance, who kept their knowledge close to the vest. Today, only a few of his alchemical recipes remain. Uraniborg, situated on the island of Ven off the coast of Sweden and named for the muse of astronomy, Urania, was demolished after Brahe died in 1601.

Now, researchers who conducted a chemical analysis of glass and pottery shards recovered from the site where the Uraniborg once stood say they’ve uncovered new clues to what took place in the Renaissance scientist’s laboratory centuries ago.

The five shards studied in the new research were among those found during excavations carried out by another team from 1988 to 1992. Discovered in the remnants of a garden surrounding the site, the fragments were believed to have come from the alchemical laboratory.

Kaare Lund Rasmussen, a professor emeritus in the department of physics, chemistry and pharmacy at the University of Southern Denmark, was inspired to study the shards after wondering what insights they might offer into understanding Brahe’s alchemical work.

As lead author of the new research, he worked with coauthor Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, on the investigation. Four of the shards contained higher concentrations of elements than expected, including nickel, copper, zinc, tin, mercury, gold and lead, the researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Heritage Science.

Gold was one substance Rasmussen already associated with Brahe. In an ongoing effort to understand why the Renaissance scientist died, Rasmussen coauthored a November 2016 study that analyzed some of Brahe’s hair and bones, and found excessive amounts of gold in his remains.

But the biggest revelation from the glass and pottery fragments in the new analysis — and the source of a separate mystery — was the presence of an element that wasn’t even known to scientists of Brahe’s time.

A surprise among the shards

Rasmussen and his team were stunned to detect tungsten among the elements found on the inside and outside of the shards. During the Renaissance, mercury and gold were commonly used in recipes for medicines to treat a wide range of diseases, but the evidence of tungsten among them is “very mysterious,” he said.

“Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe’s alchemy workshop?” Rasmussen said.

Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele uncovered tungstic acid in the mineral now known as scheelite in 1781, more than 180 years following Brahe’s death. Not long after, Spanish chemists Juan José and Fausto d’Elhuyar y de Suvisa conducted follow-up experiments that successfully isolated tungsten, described in a paper published in 1783. The chemical element, also known as wolfram, occurs naturally in certain minerals.

It’s possible that tungsten appeared in Brahe’s lab through a mineral, or perhaps he processed one in a way that isolated the tungsten without Brahe realizing it, Rasmussen said.

There is also the chance that Brahe encountered tungsten through the work of German mineralogist Georgius Agricola, who discovered the formation of an unusual substance when he attempted to smelt tin made from tin ore. Agricola named the substance wolfram in his 1546 book “De Natura Fossilium.”

“Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten’s existence,” Rasmussen said. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.”

The results of the new study will be of interest to historians and archaeologists alike, said Lawrence Principe, Drew Professor of the Humanities and director of the Singleton Center for the Study of Premodern Europe at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Principe was not involved in the research.

“As the authors note, the discovery of a tungsten residue is very surprising,” Principe said. “Tungsten ores are relatively rare and we know very little about how much they might have been experimented with in the early modern period.”

Principe thinks that anyone who came across a tungsten ore would have been struck by its extreme heaviness — the name of the element means “heavy stone” in Swedish — “and so might well have tried to smelt gold out of it, which is what I would hazard a guess might have been going on in this case,” he said.

An astronomer and an alchemist

Brahe was a dynamic scientist during the Renaissance who became famous after his discovery of a supernova in 1572. Brahe was so well-regarded that King Frederick II of Denmark and Norway offered the island of Ven to Brahe as a place to build his observatory and alchemy lab. The estate served as a home and a scientific research center where students from all across Europe came to live and work, and the alchemy lab in the basement contained a number of special furnaces, according to the study.

The lab was uniquely designed, containing 16 furnaces for heating, producing ash and distilling, with copper pipes that ran outdoors for cooling. A spiral staircase led up to the family living room, called the Winter Room, so Brahe was never far from his experiments.

Rasmussen believes that the king made such a generous gift to Brahe not just because of their good and trusting relationship, but because European kings were more esteemed if they retained famous scientists within their countries — and they didn’t want to lose them to other nations. And Brahe himself wrote that the king was eager to support the scientist’s work in both astronomy and alchemy.

Alchemy, the precursor to chemistry, served two purposes: gold-making and medicine making. Alchemists who focused on the creation of gold attempted through experimentation to make it from less valuable metals and minerals.

Brahe, inspired by the German physician Paracelsus, devoted his time and energy to making medicine rather than gold. Diseases such as the plague, leprosy and syphilis were common at the time, so alchemists like Brahe focused on creating medicinal recipes to treat such ailments, along with fevers and stomachaches, Rasmussen said.

“Today we can be a little skeptical about the effects of the Paracelsian medicines of the late 1500s, but at the time it was high-tech and cutting edge,” Rasmussen said.

Brahe only shared his treasured recipes with a few people, including his patron Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who allegedly asked Brahe for plague medicine.

Brahe’s plague medicine recipe was complicated and contained theriac, a remedy for a range of things at the time that could include up to 60 ingredients such as opium, snake flesh, oils, herbs and sulfates. Valuable tinctures could also be added to Brahe’s plague medicine recipe, including hyacinths, coral, sapphires or potable gold.

Given the amount of gold found in Brahe’s remains, he may have also taken medicine containing potable, or drinkable, gold.

The new findings provide more questions than answers about Brahe’s alchemical work, but Rasmussen said he looks forward analyzing a new and larger set of samples from the alchemy lab in the future to seek out more clues.

While it may seem strange that an astronomer who created precise instruments to study the heavens and chart the positions of more than 700 stars would be involved in alchemy, it all came down to Brahe’s worldview, study coauthor Grinder-Hansen said.

“He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, earthly substances, and the body’s organs,” Grinder-Hansen said in a statement. “Thus, the Sun, gold, and the heart were connected, and the same applied to the Moon, silver, and the brain; Jupiter, tin, and the liver; Venus, copper, and the kidneys; Saturn, lead, and the spleen; Mars, iron, and the gallbladder; and Mercury, mercury, and the lungs. Minerals and gemstones could also be linked to this system, so emeralds, for example, belonged to Mercury.”

Brahe and English physicist-mathematician Isaac Newton were some of the canonical figures of the Scientific Revolution who engaged in alchemy, said Principe, the Johns Hopkins historian of science.

“This is because, contrary to the rhetoric against alchemy that was popular from the 18th century, alchemy and chemistry were not different things in terms of practices, and so anyone seriously interested in matter and its transformations, and especially having the desire to control those transformations in order to produce things, would naturally have engaged themselves with alchemy,” he said.

A legacy of scientific achievement

After King Frederick II’s death, Brahe and the new king, Christian IV, did not have a good relationship. Brahe was known to ignore orders from the king, including those regarding his responsibility for maintaining a fire in the Kullen Lighthouse on the southwest coast of Sweden and safekeeping a chapel containing the remains of the king’s mother and father, Rasmussen said. So when Brahe died in 1601, the king and his advisers had Uraniborg torn down so it couldn’t exist as a monument to the scientist, and the bricks were repurposed for other buildings.

But Brahe’s scientific achievements have not been forgotten. He was recognized for making great strides during his lifetime, and those milestones paved the way for future scientists.

While Brahe correctly believed that the moon orbited Earth and the planets orbited the sun, he also thought the sun must orbit around Earth. But it was his assistant Johannes Kepler who developed the laws of planetary motion to understand how the planets orbited around the sun.

Brahe, Kepler, Newton and Galileo Galilei changed the way people understand the world and its place in the universe.

“Tycho Brahe was the first of four giants standing on each other’s shoulders with 25-year intervals from 1580 to 1680, who formulated what can be called the modern view of the world — as opposed to the medieval view,” Rasmussen said."

Alchemy, the precursor to chemistry, served two purposes: gold-making and medicine making. Alchemists who focused on the creation of gold attempted through experimentation to make it from less valuable metals and minerals.

Brahe, inspired by the German physician Paracelsus, devoted his time and energy to making medicine rather than gold. Diseases such as the plague, leprosy and syphilis were common at the time, so alchemists like Brahe focused on creating medicinal recipes to treat such ailments, along with fevers and stomachaches, Rasmussen said.

“Today we can be a little skeptical about the effects of the Paracelsian medicines of the late 1500s, but at the time it was high-tech and cutting edge,” Rasmussen said.

Brahe only shared his treasured recipes with a few people, including his patron Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who allegedly asked Brahe for plague medicine.

Brahe’s plague medicine recipe was complicated and contained theriac, a remedy for a range of things at the time that could include up to 60 ingredients such as opium, snake flesh, oils, herbs and sulfates. Valuable tinctures could also be added to Brahe’s plague medicine recipe, including hyacinths, coral, sapphires or potable gold.

Given the amount of gold found in Brahe’s remains, he may have also taken medicine containing potable, or drinkable, gold.

The new findings provide more questions than answers about Brahe’s alchemical work, but Rasmussen said he looks forward analyzing a new and larger set of samples from the alchemy lab in the future to seek out more clues.

While it may seem strange that an astronomer who created precise instruments to study the heavens and chart the positions of more than 700 stars would be involved in alchemy, it all came down to Brahe’s worldview, study coauthor Grinder-Hansen said.

“He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, earthly substances, and the body’s organs,” Grinder-Hansen said in a statement. “Thus, the Sun, gold, and the heart were connected, and the same applied to the Moon, silver, and the brain; Jupiter, tin, and the liver; Venus, copper, and the kidneys; Saturn, lead, and the spleen; Mars, iron, and the gallbladder; and Mercury, mercury, and the lungs. Minerals and gemstones could also be linked to this system, so emeralds, for example, belonged to Mercury.”

Brahe and English physicist-mathematician Isaac Newton were some of the canonical figures of the Scientific Revolution who engaged in alchemy, said Principe, the Johns Hopkins historian of science.

“This is because, contrary to the rhetoric against alchemy that was popular from the 18th century, alchemy and chemistry were not different things in terms of practices, and so anyone seriously interested in matter and its transformations, and especially having the desire to control those transformations in order to produce things, would naturally have engaged themselves with alchemy,” he said.

A legacy of scientific achievement

After King Frederick II’s death, Brahe and the new king, Christian IV, did not have a good relationship. Brahe was known to ignore orders from the king, including those regarding his responsibility for maintaining a fire in the Kullen Lighthouse on the southwest coast of Sweden and safekeeping a chapel containing the remains of the king’s mother and father, Rasmussen said. So when Brahe died in 1601, the king and his advisers had Uraniborg torn down so it couldn’t exist as a monument to the scientist, and the bricks were repurposed for other buildings.

But Brahe’s scientific achievements have not been forgotten. He was recognized for making great strides during his lifetime, and those milestones paved the way for future scientists.

While Brahe correctly believed that the moon orbited Earth and the planets orbited the sun, he also thought the sun must orbit around Earth. But it was his assistant Johannes Kepler who developed the laws of planetary motion to understand how the planets orbited around the sun.

Brahe, Kepler, Newton and Galileo Galilei changed the way people understand the world and its place in the universe.

“Tycho Brahe was the first of four giants standing on each other’s shoulders with 25-year intervals from 1580 to 1680, who formulated what can be called the modern view of the world — as opposed to the medieval view,” Rasmussen said."

CNN —

Picture a clock ticking so steadily that it doesn’t lose a second, even after running for 1 billion years. Scientists are now closer than ever to realizing that level of timekeeping precision, new research has revealed.

Such a device would greatly surpass the capabilities of atomic clocks, which define the span of a second through controlled energy jumps in atoms’ electrons and are currently the pinnacle of accuracy for measuring time. In atomic clocks, signals that excite the atoms oscillate at a frequency of billions of times per second.

Researchers recently developed a technique that could elevate this accuracy by triggering and measuring oscillations in an even trickier target: an atom’s nucleus. For this nuclear clock, the scientists used ultraviolet light to excite nuclear particles in an atom of thorium-229 embedded in solid crystal. They then measured the frequency of the energy pulses affecting the nucleus — the equivalent of a pendulum in a regular clock — by counting the waves in the UV signal using a tool called an optical frequency comb.

Causing energy jumps in a nucleus requires a much higher frequency signal than is required for atomic clocks. With more wave cycles per second, this approach is expected to provide more accurate time measurements.

Scientists measure the frequency of energy pulses affecting an atom's nucleus by counting the waves in the UV signal. Wavelengths that can induce a nucleus transition oscillate at higher frequencies, enabling more precise time measurements, the researchers say. National Institute of Standards and Technology

While their nuclear clock is still a work in progress, once realized it could transform not only timekeeping but also the study of physics, even affecting how scientists investigate the fabric of the universe. The prototype is already as accurate as an atomic clock, and future versions are expected to be even more precise and stable, according to research published September 4 in the journal Nature.

Now that the researchers have shown that it’s possible to produce and measure these signals, “there are a lot of things that we can push to further improve the accuracy,” said lead study author Chuankun Zhang, a graduate student at JILA — a joint research center funded by the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

For example, Zhang told CNN, adjustments could include tweaking the alignment and frequency of the lasers pinging the nucleus.

“This work truly marks the dawn of a nuclear clock,” said Dr. Olga Kocharovskaya, a distinguished professor of physics at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the research.

In 2023, Kocharovskaya and other researchers tested nuclei of scandium-45 atoms as possible candidates for a nuclear clock. At the time, those atoms produced the most robust energy transition — and measurable pulse — ever seen in a nucleus, but the new results from thorium-229 generated a stronger signal and were more stable, Kocharovskaya told CNN in an email.

“The broader significance is in the confidence this paper provides in the reality of the nuclear clock,” she said. “It leaves no doubts that such a clock is feasible and will be built soon.”

Time after time

In atomic clocks, an atom’s electrons are pinged with electromagnetic radiation at specific frequencies. Bursts of energy excite the electrons, pushing them into a higher orbit around the atom. Oscillations that trigger electrons’ transitions between states mark the passage of time, according to NASA.

The reliability of atomic clocks is far greater than in everyday clocks that measure seconds in vibrations of quartz crystals, which are prone to dropping out of sync. For decades, atomic clocks have been used in GPS technologies, for space exploration and for keeping international time.

However, atomic clocks are also vulnerable to sync loss. Electromagnetic disturbances can disrupt excited electrons and affect the precision of the timekeeping, Zhang said.

Particles in an atom’s nucleus, on the other hand, are harder to agitate than electrons. Protons and neutrons are tightly bound together by the strong nuclear force — the most powerful of all the fundamental forces. Wavelengths that can induce a nucleus transition oscillate at higher frequencies, enabling more precise time measurements, the researchers reported.

Before this study, there were several important breakthroughs for the development of nuclear clocks. The first, in 1976, was the discovery that the thorium nucleus was “uniquely low-energy” and could be pushed into an excited state by using vacuum ultraviolet, or VUV, laser light. By 2003, scientists were proposing that because thorium required less energy to excite its nucleus than most other types of atoms did, the isotope thorium-229 would be a good candidate for nuclear clocks, according to the study.

In 2023, scientists pioneered a method of embedding thorium-229 into crystals; this solid state system suppressed signals from nuclear decay, making desired signals easier to track. Earlier this year, other researchers measured the wavelength of VUV light required to excite the nucleus in thorium-229.

“Our work builds on top of that,” Zhang said. “With our frequency comb light source and this crystal, we were able to excite the nuclear transition and the various transition energies.” Their results were about 1 million times more precise than previous measurements, Zhang added.

“This paper is a real tour de force,” said Dr. Shimon Kolkowitz, an associate professor and chair of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.

“The quality of the data and the speed with which they achieved the remarkable results in this new manuscript is really amazing,” said Kolkowitz, who was not involved in the research. “It represents a major step forward in the development of nuclear clocks, which physicists have been working towards for decades.”

Revolutionizing physics

Atomic clocks’ accuracy and stability have already given scientists important tools for studying earthquakes, gravitational fields and space-time. These fields could experience “a major boost” from nuclear clocks, Kocharovskaya said. Nuclear clocks would be not only more precise but also simpler and more portable, because unlike atomic clocks they wouldn’t require high vacuum conditions, extreme cooling and powerful shielding from magnetic and electric disruption, she said.

The study of physics itself could be revolutionized by using nuclear clocks alongside atomic clocks, according to Zhang. Monitoring and comparing frequency ratios in the two types of clocks over time could help scientists tell whether fundamental physics constants are truly as constant as they seem or if they shift at levels previously too minuscule to measure, Zhang said.

This paired clock technique could be a game changer for the study of dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 80% of the universe but which has never been directly measured, he added.

Some scientists have proposed that dark matter interacts with particles such as electrons, quarks and gluons, but in amounts that are currently undetectable.

“We want to see if dark matter could interact with the atomic nucleus in a slightly different way compared to the electron orbit in the atom,” Zhang said. “If the nuclear clock and the atomic clock transition frequency ratio is changing over time, it would be an indication of new physics.”

Though there is still much progress to be made before nuclear clocks surpass the performance of atomic clocks — or replace them — these findings hint that such a time isn’t far off, Kolkowitz said.

“As better UV laser sources are developed and as some of the mysteries and tricks of nuclear clocks get worked out, I expect that eventually some of the kinds of experiments we are currently doing in my lab to test relativity and search for new physics with atomic clocks will instead be performed with nuclear clocks,” Kolkowitz said.

What’s next for nuclear clocks? At this point, only time will tell.

CNN —

The Europa Clipper spacecraft passed a key milestone on Monday and is on track to launch next month to explore and seek signs of habitability on one of Jupiter’s moons, according to NASA. The launch window for its journey opens on October 10.

The mission passed Key Decision Point E, a critical planning stage approving the mission to move forward with launch. The approval was a relief to the Europa Clipper team after the discovery in May of a possible issue with transistors on the spacecraft.

Transistors help control the vehicle’s flow of electricity, and engineers were concerned about the components’ survival in Jupiter’s harsh radiation environment.

Extensive testing of the transistors took place over four months at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland; and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

The team was able to complete necessary testing in time, preventing a 13-month delay of the launch to explore Europa, an ice-covered world that may have the potential to support life in its salty, subsurface ocean. Europa Clipper carries 10 science instruments that could determine whether life is possible on another place in our solar system besides Earth.

Now, Europa Clipper has been approved to launch, with no changes to the mission plan, goals or trajectory.

“It’s the last sort of big review before we really get into that launch fever, and we’re really happy to say that they unequivocally passed that review today,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, during a news conference Monday.

Solving the radiation problem

In May, the manufacturer of the transistors alerted the mission team that the parts may not be as radiation-resistant as previously believed. The transistors are located across the spacecraft.

Jupiter dwarfs other worlds as the largest planet in our solar system, and it has a magnetic field 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s. That magnetic field traps charged particles and accelerates them to high speeds. The rapidly moving particles release energy in the form of intense radiation that bombards Europa and Jupiter’s other closest moons.

Any spacecraft heading to Jupiter needs radiation-hardened electronics.

“Jupiter’s engulfed in more radiation than any planet in our solar system, and that’s one of the reasons why exploring the Jupiter system is so challenging,” said Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager at JPL.

“Europa sits near the outer edge of the worst part of that radiation belt,” he added. “Flying near Europa exposes us to this high flux of damaging particles, and so the mission engineers and Europa Clipper need to be sure that the spacecraft components can survive that radiation environment for the duration of our four-year mission.”

Data from previous NASA missions to Jupiter, including the Juno probe currently studying the planet and some of its moons, was used to validate the testing process for the transistors, Evans said.

The tests were conducted 24 hours a day since May, and they simulated spaceflight conditions to see how the spacecraft and its components would fare when the vehicle conducts 49 flybys of Europa and ultimately 80 orbits around Jupiter over a four-year period.

The team determined that the transistors can self-heal in between flybys.

“We concluded, after all of this testing, that during our orbits around Jupiter, while Europa Clipper does dip into the radiation environment, once it comes out, it comes out long enough to give those transistors the opportunity to heal and partially recover between flybys,” Evans said.

A radiation monitor on the spacecraft will enable the team to check how the transistors are faring.

“I personally have high confidence that we can complete the original mission for exploring Europa as planned,” Evans said.

Exploring an ocean world

When Curt Niebur, Europa Clipper program scientist, began working at NASA in 2003, he faced the task of pushing a Europa mission forward. Each year, the effort to get Europa Clipper designed and built has seemed more difficult, he said.

“There was no harder year than this past year and especially this past summer,” Niebur said. “But through all of that, the one thing that we never doubted was that this was going to be worth it. It’s a chance for us to explore, not a world that might have been habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable today — a chance to do the first exploration of this new kind of world that we’ve discovered very recently called an ocean world that is just totally immersed and covered in a liquid water ocean completely unlike anything we’ve seen before. That’s what’s waiting us at Europa.”

Europa Clipper is not a life-detection mission, Niebur added.

The mission’s key goals are centered on figuring out whether the proper ingredients to support life as we know it — including water, energy and chemistry — are on Europa. And without any scientific instrument that can directly determine the existence of life, Clipper can’t conclusively find evidence of it, he said.

“You can bet your bottom dollar that if Europa Clipper tells us, yes, those ingredients are there, that we are going to be knocking on the door fighting for second mission to go looking for life,” Niebur said.

Europa Clipper will be key to helping NASA determine where to send follow-up missions, such as parts of the ice crust that may be thin and where water from the subsurface ocean could gush, said Laurie Leshin, director for JPL.

“If we get there and we do this investigation, and the good news is it has all the ingredients and it is habitable, what that means is that there are two places in one solar system that have all the ingredients for life that are habitable right now at the same time,” Niebur said.

“Think of what that means when you extend that result to the billions and billions of other solar systems in this galaxy,” he added. “Setting aside the ‘Is there life’ question on Europa, just the habitability question in and of itself opens up a huge new paradigm for searching for life in the galaxy.”"

science,"Yellow food dye can make skin transparent in mice, study finds",2024-09-05,Katie Hunt,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

In H.G. Wells’ 1897 science fiction novel, “The Invisible Man,” the protagonist invents a serum that makes the cells in his body transparent by controlling how they bend light.

More than 100 years later, scientists have discovered a real-life version of the substance: A commonly used food coloring found in snack foods and candies such as tortilla chips and candy corn can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing scientists to see its organs function, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.

The breakthrough could revolutionize biomedical research and, should it be successfully tested in humans, have wide-ranging applications in medicine and health care, such as making veins more visible to draw blood.

Researchers made the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice transparent by applying a mixture of water and a yellow food coloring called tartrazine. Washing away any remaining solution reversed the process, which did not harm the animals. The mice’s fur was removed before the application of the solution.

“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said the study’s first author, Zihao Ou, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a statement.

Time-lapse images of blood vessels in the brain just beneath the skull of a sedated mouse are revealed by dyeing the tissues with FD&C Yellow No. 5, a food coloring also known as tartrazine. The process doesn't involve any surgery, incisions or damaging of the mouse’s bone or skin. US NSF

Light-absorbing dye molecules

The “magic” uses insights from the field of optics. Light-absorbing dye molecules enhance the transmission of light through the skin by suppressing the tissue’s ability to scatter light.

The dye, when mixed with water, modifies the refractive index — a measure of the way a substance bends light — of the aqueous part of the tissue to better match the index of proteins and fats in the tissue. The process is akin to a dissipating cloud of fog.

“We combined the yellow dye, which is a molecule that absorbs most light, especially blue and ultraviolet light, with skin, which is a scattering medium,” said Ou, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.

“Individually, these two things block most light from getting through them,” he said. “But when we put them together, we were able to achieve transparency of the mouse skin.”

Once the dye had completely diffused into the skin, the skin became transparent.

“It takes a few minutes for the transparency to appear,” Ou said. “It’s similar to the way a facial cream or mask works: The time needed depends on how fast the molecules diffuse into the skin.”

The team experimented with chicken breasts before conducting work on live animals.

In mice, the researchers were able to observe blood vessels directly in the surface of the brain through the transparent skin of the skull. The mice’s internal organs were visible in the abdomen as well as the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract.

The transparent areas take on an orangish color, Ou said, similar to that of the food dye.

The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children. A state bill, if signed into law, would ban the use of the food coloring in food served in public schools in California.

Ou said it was important that the dye is biocompatible — safe for living organisms. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work,” he said.

Possible biomedical applications for humans

The researchers have not tested the process on humans, and it’s not clear what dosage of dye or delivery method would be necessary. Human skin is about 10 times thicker than that of a mouse, according to the researchers.

“Looking forward, this technology could make veins more visible, easing … the procedure of drawing blood or administering fluids via a needle — especially for elderly patients with veins that are difficult to locate,” said senior author Guosong Hong, a Stanford assistant professor of materials science, via email.

“Moreover, this innovation could assist in the early detection of skin cancer, improve light penetration for deep tissue treatments like photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and make laser-based tattoo removal more straightforward.”

Christopher Rowlands, a senior lecturer in the department of bioengineering at Imperial College London, said he was “kicking himself” for not coming up with the same insight as the Stanford-led team, which is based on the widely studied and long-standing physics principle called Kramers-Kronig relations: When a material absorbs a lot of light at one color, it will bend light more at other colors.

“It’s blatantly obvious when someone points it out, but no one had thought of it for 100 and something years,” said Rowlands, who wasn’t involved in the study but coauthored a commentary published alongside the research.

Along with Jon Gorecki, an experimental optical physicist at the same institution who also wasn’t involved in the study, Rowlands wrote that the approach offered a new way to visualize the structure and activity of deep tissues and organs in a living animal in a safe, temporary and noninvasive manner.

“It just works. You rub it on a mouse, and you can see what it had for breakfast. It’s that powerful,” he added.

Rowlands and Gorecki said that existing methods to turn tissue transparent use solutions that have side effects such as dehydration and swelling and can alter the structure of the tissue. However, tartrazine was used at a low concentration, and its effects were easily undone, potentially facilitating prolonged study of biological processes in live animals, they wrote.

The duo noted the discovery was an example of life imitating art, with the dye solution echoing the serum imagined in “The Invisible Man.”

“The protagonist (in the story) invents a serum that renders the cells in his body transparent by precisely controlling their refractive index to match that of the surrounding medium, air,” they wrote.

“One hundred twenty-seven years later … biocompatible dyes make living tissues transparent by tuning the refractive index of the surrounding medium to match that of the cells.”

However, Ou and Hong said a totally invisible mouse was a stretch: The current approach cannot render bone transparent.

“So far, we only tested soft tissues, including brain, muscle, and skin. We haven’t done much investigation with hard tissues such as bone, so I am not sure if we would be able to make the mouse completely invisible,” Ou said via email.

“However, a partially transparent (mouse) will already enable numerous research opportunities to answer questions relating to development, regeneration, as well as aging.”"

In H.G. Wells’ 1897 science fiction novel, “The Invisible Man,” the protagonist invents a serum that makes the cells in his body transparent by controlling how they bend light.

More than 100 years later, scientists have discovered a real-life version of the substance: A commonly used food coloring found in snack foods and candies such as tortilla chips and candy corn can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing scientists to see its organs function, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.

The breakthrough could revolutionize biomedical research and, should it be successfully tested in humans, have wide-ranging applications in medicine and health care, such as making veins more visible to draw blood.

Researchers made the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice transparent by applying a mixture of water and a yellow food coloring called tartrazine. Washing away any remaining solution reversed the process, which did not harm the animals. The mice’s fur was removed before the application of the solution.

“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said the study’s first author, Zihao Ou, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a statement.

Time-lapse images of blood vessels in the brain just beneath the skull of a sedated mouse are revealed by dyeing the tissues with FD&C Yellow No. 5, a food coloring also known as tartrazine. The process doesn't involve any surgery, incisions or damaging of the mouse’s bone or skin. US NSF

Light-absorbing dye molecules

The “magic” uses insights from the field of optics. Light-absorbing dye molecules enhance the transmission of light through the skin by suppressing the tissue’s ability to scatter light.

The dye, when mixed with water, modifies the refractive index — a measure of the way a substance bends light — of the aqueous part of the tissue to better match the index of proteins and fats in the tissue. The process is akin to a dissipating cloud of fog.

“We combined the yellow dye, which is a molecule that absorbs most light, especially blue and ultraviolet light, with skin, which is a scattering medium,” said Ou, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.

“Individually, these two things block most light from getting through them,” he said. “But when we put them together, we were able to achieve transparency of the mouse skin.”

Once the dye had completely diffused into the skin, the skin became transparent.

“It takes a few minutes for the transparency to appear,” Ou said. “It’s similar to the way a facial cream or mask works: The time needed depends on how fast the molecules diffuse into the skin.”

The team experimented with chicken breasts before conducting work on live animals.

In mice, the researchers were able to observe blood vessels directly in the surface of the brain through the transparent skin of the skull. The mice’s internal organs were visible in the abdomen as well as the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract.

The transparent areas take on an orangish color, Ou said, similar to that of the food dye.

The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children.

CNN —

SpaceX’s latest mission — a bold and risky trek into Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts by a four-person crew of civilians who will also aim to conduct the first commercial spacewalk — just took flight.

The mission, dubbed Polaris Dawn, lifted off at 5:23 a.m. ET.

SpaceX livestreamed the event on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk purchased in 2022.

As the capsule entered Earth’s orbit, ground controllers, led by SpaceX launch director Frank Messina, offered words of encouragement to the Polaris Dawn crew, which includes the first SpaceX employees ever to venture to space.

“As you gaze towards the North Star, remember that your courage lights the path for future explorers. We trust your skills, your bravery, and your teamwork to carry out the mission that lies ahead,” they said. “Know that the entire team back here is with you every step, watching, supporting and cheering you on as you walk into space. We’re sending you hugs from the ground.”

This launch comes after several weather delays in late August and earlier in the morning on Tuesday hampered the Polaris Dawn crew’s efforts to get off the ground.

Further complicating launch prospects was the fact that SpaceX didn’t just need clear weather for the mission to take off — it needed to ensure there are calm waters and winds as the crew will return from space after a five-day excursion. Timing their return could be critical. Because carrying out a spacewalk will create a drain on oxygen supplies, the Polaris Dawn mission will have only enough life support for five or six days in space.

The ride to orbit

After the countdown clock struck zero, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket roared to life, sending a blinding blaze and deafening blast across the launch site at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The crew rode atop the rocket, strapped inside an igloo-shaped SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which measures about 13 feet (4 meters) across at its base, as the rocket tore away from the grips of Earth’s gravity.

After firing for 2 ½ minutes, the bottommost part of the Falcon 9 rocket — called the first stage — spent most of its fuel. At that point, the first stage detached from the rocket’s second stage as the upper portion fired up its engine and continued propelling the Crew Dragon spacecraft to faster speeds.

Meanwhile, the first stage of the Falcon 9 guided itself back to Earth to land on a seafaring platform so it could be refurbished and used again on future missions. That’s a signature SpaceX move that the company said helps reduce the cost of rocket launches.

To enter Earth’s orbit, the Falcon 9 rocket hit more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,358 kilometers per hour), or “orbital velocity.” When it reached the desired speed, the Crew Dragon broke away, navigating the vacuum of space using only its onboard thrusters for the remainder of the mission.

First commercial spacewalk attempt

Polaris Dawn is the brainchild of SpaceX and Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of financial technology firm Shift4 Payments, who made his first foray into spaceflight with the Inspiration4 mission in September 2021.

This flight, however, is not a joyride.

Isaacman and his crewmates — including close friend and former US Air Force pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet as well as SpaceX engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis — hope to rack up several superlatives on this mission.

First, the SpaceX capsule aims to carry the crew to record-setting heights for an orbit around Earth, surpassing the milestone set by NASA’s 1966 Gemini 11 mission, which reached 853 miles (1,373 kilometers). If successful, Polaris Dawn would beat that record by about 20 miles (32 kilometers).

The Polaris Dawn spaceflight would also be the highest any human has flown since NASA’s Apollo program — which ended in 1972 and cumulatively carried 24 astronauts a quarter million miles to the moon rather than stopping in Earth’s orbit.

Polaris Dawn may also mark the farthest any woman has ever gone into space.

To kick off day three of this mission, the civilian crew, while orbiting at a lower altitude of about 435 miles (700 kilometers) above Earth, will attempt a history-making spacewalk.

The endeavor will be hazardous, exposing all four crew members and the Crew Dragon’s interior to the vacuum of space. Such a situation may make it difficult to relock the vehicle’s hatch due to differences in pressure. And exposure to the vacuum may cause toxins to be released from hardware when the cabin is repressurized, though SpaceX said it has taken steps to prevent this."

CNN —

SpaceX’s latest attempt to push the cosmic boundaries is set to kick off this week with a mission called Polaris Dawn: a nail-biting, five-day trek to orbit with a crew of private astronauts traveling into Earth’s radiation belts and hoping to conduct the first commercial spacewalk.

The mission is slated to take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida between 3:38 and 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday — after previous attempts to launch in late August were delayed — carrying four civilians on the daring excursion.

It will mark the second trip to space for Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of payments platform company Shift4. He made a less risky journey in 2021 on a mission dubbed Inspiration4.

Polaris Dawn is one in a series of missions that Isaacman plans to carry out alongside SpaceX — three flights aiming to test new technologies that can help advance the Elon Musk-led company’s goal of seeing humans live and work on other planets.

Joining Isaacman on Polaris Dawn will be two SpaceX engineers, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, the first from the company to join a mission to orbit. Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a former United States Air Force pilot and longtime friend of Isaacman’s, rounds out the crew.

Members of the crew come to the mission with extensive experience piloting jet aircraft — a common career before becoming a professional astronaut — or have worked with and trained NASA astronauts, as is the case for Menon and Gillis.

Risky business

After takeoff Tuesday, the four-person team is expected to travel into an oval-shaped orbit that extends as far as 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) from Earth — high enough to plunge the vehicle and crew into the Van Allen radiation belts. No human has traveled so far into space or passed through the radiation environment since NASA’s Apollo program.

The Polaris Dawn mission will also aim to reach the highest orbit around Earth for a crewed mission — with eyes on surpassing the 1966 record set by NASA’s Gemini 11 by 20 miles (32 kilometers). The latter reached 853 miles (1,373 kilometers) nearly 60 years ago.

Menon and Gillis would also become the first women to make such a journey.

Almost immediately after launch, the crew will begin preparing for a high-risk spacewalk, making use of Extravehicular Activity, or EVA, suits that SpaceX developed in just 2 ½ years. If successful, the spacewalk, which could take place early Thursday, would mark the first time that civilians (or nongovernment astronauts) have carried out such an endeavor.

The quartet is then set to focus on roughly 40 science experiments before the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule steers itself back toward Earth. As with any mission to space, reentry is expected to be dangerous — with pressure and friction heating the spacecraft’s exterior to more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius) — before the spacecraft free-falls toward the ocean and deploys parachutes to slow its descent.

The mission is expected to last about five days. Here’s a closer look at its four crew members.

Jared Isaacman: ‘Ambitious objectives’

As one of the instigators of the Polaris Dawn mission, Isaacman had a hand in selecting the crewmates that would travel alongside him. And this team is distinct from the one that accompanied Isaacman on the Inspiration4 mission nearly three years ago.

That mission brought along people from all walks of life, including a cancer survivor, an artist, and the beneficiary of a raffle. Inspiration4 — the first commercial spaceflight mission for SpaceX — sought to prove that humans from various backgrounds could train for and execute a flight in orbit. The four-member crew spent three days in space, lapping planet Earth.

But due to the experimental nature and risks associated with Polaris Dawn, Isaacman said this mission required a different approach.

“I think you build a crew for your mission objectives. The objective for Inspiration4 was to inspire people to do things differently than how it had been historically done at NASA. For what was largely like a random process, everybody so exceeded my expectations,” Isaacman told CNN.

“But Polaris is a test and developmental program — and that appeals to my aviation background and things we’ve done in the past,” he added. “It’s set out (to) have ambitious objectives. So, you assemble the best crew you could for it.”

Anna Menon: A lifelong dream

Isaacman already knew Menon from the Inspiration4 mission: She was a technical adviser to the family members of that crew, explaining the complexities of spaceflight to loved ones on the ground.

Months after Inspiration4 came back to Earth, she learned that Isaacman was planning his return.

“I found out about it through a meeting that was put on my calendar. … I suddenly start to feel like this is not the average meeting (and) very quickly, Jared asked if I would like to go on his next mission,” Menon said. “I was just completely surprised. Absolutely never would have seen this coming in my entire life.”

But Menon said she has longed to travel to space, which captured her imagination during a trip to Johnson Space Center in Houston as a fourth grader.

“I got to experience a day in the life of an astronaut and a mission control and flight controller,” she told CNN. “And from that time on, I did dream of having that opportunity.”

Menon’s passion led to a master’s degree in biomedical engineering from Duke University and a seven-year stint at NASA, working as a biomedical flight controller for the International Space Station.

After switching to a role at SpaceX, she served in mission control during some of the company’s highest-profile missions, including 2020’s Demo-2 — the inaugural crewed flight of SpaceX’s Dragon capsule that returned astronaut launches to US soil for the first time in a decade.

Still, Menon told CNN, she did not anticipate traveling to space.

“I think I very much recognized the odds were extremely low,” she said. “And I probably, if I’m honest with myself, had written it off.”

But spaceflight now appears to run in the family. Just days before Menon learned she would join the Polaris Dawn crew, her husband — Anil Menon, who also worked with the Inspiration4 crew as a SpaceX employee — was selected as a NASA astronaut. (He has not been assigned to his first mission.)

“It was an absolute whirlwind of a week in our household,” Anna Menon said. “I called him up right after I got out of the meeting with Jared, and I just remember his reaction being extreme shock and such excitement — over the moon excited.”

Their two children, now 4 and 6 years old, have watched as their parents trained to take on risky challenges. Menon said her eldest is just beginning to grasp the gravity of the situation.

Menon also coauthored a book for them, called “Kisses From Space,” that she plans to read aloud during the mission as part of a fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

Menon will be a mission specialist during the Polaris Dawn flight, helping to carry out science experiments during the trip, and she’ll be the mission’s medical officer.

If space adaptation syndrome — a type of severe motion sickness that can strike astronauts — hits the crew, it will be up to Menon to administer medication that can alleviate those symptoms.

Sarah Gillis: From intern to astronaut

Dealing with — and searching for answers to — the daunting biological challenges that humans face while floating in a spacecraft is another cornerstone goal of the Polaris Dawn mission.

Some of this mission’s science experiments are geared toward a better understanding of space adaptation syndrome and predicting whom it will affect.

As a lead operations engineer at SpaceX, Gillis has taken the reins on training astronauts for crucial missions. Among her trainees were the first astronauts to fly in a Crew Dragon capsule — NASA’s Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley — before the historic Demo-2 mission in 2020.

Gillis also trained the Inspiration4 crew for its 2021 mission, and she saw firsthand how spaceflight can take a toll.

Isaacman has said two of the crew members on Inspiration4 experienced space adaptation syndrome (about 1 in 2 people do), and there were issues with the Crew Dragon toilet that threatened the team’s comfort during its 3-day trip.

“Human spaceflight is not going to be glamorous all the time. Humans aren’t meant to live and work without gravity.” - Sarah Gillis, SpaceX Lead Operations Engineer

“I’m really, really interested to see how (being in microgravity) goes for me and what I learn and bring back to the training program at SpaceX,” Gillis told CNN.

Like Menon, Gillis was shocked to learn about possible space travel during a meeting that popped up on her calendar in late 2021.

“It was a pretty wild, random workday,” Gillis said, “but I think my immediate response was, ‘Hell yes.’”

During her career at SpaceX, where she has worked for nearly a decade, Gillis helped develop the company’s Crew Dragon operations process and has been close to the sidelines of human spaceflight.

Despite her proximity to those missions, however, Gillis said she never imagined she would fly aboard the capsule to which she has dedicated much of her professional career.

“I think human spaceflight captivated my imagination, and that’s why I tried to pursue things that interested me in that field,” she told CNN. “(But) I don’t think in any of this, I considered it was possible.”

Gillis did not grow up dreaming of cosmic adventures. She’s a trained violinist who did not seriously consider a career in space until her junior year of high school, when she met NASA astronaut Joe Tanner. He helped her with a senior project and encouraged her to pursue engineering in college.

“I ultimately applied for aerospace engineering at (the University of Colorado Boulder) because of that,” she said, “and ended up down this whole journey of becoming an intern at SpaceX, and then, many years later, getting to fly on the spacecraft.”

Gillis and Menon have spent the last several years splitting time between their day jobs at SpaceX — leaving their fingerprints on the hardware that will carry them to space — and training for the Polaris Dawn mission.

“Now, I would say, over the last couple months, we’ve transitioned to full-time crew members,” Gillis added.

Scott ‘Kidd’ Poteet: ‘Zero reservations’

Poteet has been along for the ride throughout Isaacman’s pursuit of space ambitions.

Their friendship stems from experiences in the air: Poteet spent 20 years in the Air Force, racking up about 3,200 hours of jet flight experience. And Isaacman is a passionate pilot with thousands of hours of experience flying jets and experimental aircraft.

Poteet went to work for Isaacman after meeting him at an air show. Poteet joined Draken International, a tactical fighter aircraft supplier and contractor for the US military that Isaacman founded in 2012.

Draken provided a “bad guy” service, Poteet said, using jets to role-play as enemies during military training. It commercialized a role that Poteet had also played in the Air Force.

That experiencelasted about five years, Poteet said, before Isaacman sold the company.

Since Isaacman shifted focus spaceward, he and Poteet have been in lockstep. During Inspiration4, Poteet was the mission director. But Poteet said he did not imagine a ride to space would be within his grasp.

“I was not the best academic student growing up — grade school through high school,” Poteet told CNN. “But I admired all the astronauts and the NASA programs: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo leading up to the shuttle era.”

But as a former operational test pilot, Poteet said he understood Isaacman’s desire to push boundaries and help SpaceX take ambitious leaps forward in its commercial spaceflight capabilities.

“Similar to (SpaceX CEO) Elon (Musk), Jared has got visions of: How do we continue to push the envelope and move the needle on space exploration?” Poteet said. “The end result was the Polaris program.”

“I was a firm believer in what (Isaacman) had envisioned,” Poteet added.

The Polaris Dawn mission came together in 2 ½ years, breakneck speed as far as aerospace timelines typically go.

Poteet said that this mission shows what the SpaceX team can “accomplish in a very short few years (and) is a true testament to its professionalism.”

“I have absolutely zero reservations,” Poteet said about making his foray into space. “I have full faith and confidence that they’ve crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I’ in preparation for our mission.”"

SpaceX’s latest attempt to push the cosmic boundaries is set to kick off this week with a mission called Polaris Dawn: a nail-biting, five-day trek to orbit with a crew of private astronauts traveling into Earth’s radiation belts and hoping to conduct the first commercial spacewalk.

The mission is slated to take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida between 3:38 and 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday — after previous attempts to launch in late August were delayed — carrying four civilians on the daring excursion.

It will mark the second trip to space for Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of payments platform company Shift4. He made a less risky journey in 2021 on a mission dubbed Inspiration4.

Polaris Dawn is one in a series of missions that Isaacman plans to carry out alongside SpaceX — three flights aiming to test new technologies that can help advance the Elon Musk-led company’s goal of seeing humans live and work on other planets.

Joining Isaacman on Polaris Dawn will be two SpaceX engineers, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, the first from the company to join a mission to orbit. Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a former United States Air Force pilot and longtime friend of Isaacman’s, rounds out the crew.

Members of the crew come to the mission with extensive experience piloting jet aircraft — a common career before becoming a professional astronaut — or have worked with and trained NASA astronauts, as is the case for Menon and Gillis.

Risky business

After takeoff Tuesday, the four-person team is expected to travel into an oval-shaped orbit that extends as far as 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) from Earth — high enough to plunge the vehicle and crew into the Van Allen radiation belts. No human has traveled so far into space or passed through the radiation environment since NASA’s Apollo program.

The Polaris Dawn mission will also aim to reach the highest orbit around Earth for a crewed mission — with eyes on surpassing the 1966 record set by NASA’s Gemini 11 by 20 miles (32 kilometers). The latter reached 853 miles (1,373 kilometers) nearly 60 years ago.

Menon and Gillis would also become the first women to make such a journey.

Almost immediately after launch, the crew will begin preparing for a high-risk spacewalk, making use of Extravehicular Activity, or EVA, suits that SpaceX developed in just 2 ½ years. If successful, the spacewalk, which could take place early Thursday, would mark the first time that civilians (or nongovernment astronauts) have carried out such an endeavor.

The quartet is then set to focus on roughly 40 science experiments before the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule steers itself back toward Earth. As with any mission to space, reentry is expected to be dangerous — with pressure and friction heating the spacecraft’s exterior to more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius) — before the spacecraft free-falls toward the ocean and deploys parachutes to slow its descent.

The mission is expected to last about five days. Here’s a closer look at its four crew members.

Jared Isaacman: ‘Ambitious objectives’

As one of the instigators of the Polaris Dawn mission, Isaacman had a hand in selecting the crewmates that would travel alongside him. And this team is distinct from the one that accompanied Isaacman on the Inspiration4 mission nearly three years ago.

That mission brought along people from all walks of life, including a cancer survivor, an artist, and the beneficiary of a raffle. Inspiration4 — the first commercial spaceflight mission for SpaceX — sought to prove that humans from various backgrounds could train for and execute a flight in orbit. The four-member crew spent three days in space, lapping planet Earth.

But due to the experimental nature and risks associated with Polaris Dawn, Isaacman said this mission required a different approach.

“I think you build a crew for your mission objectives. The objective for Inspiration4 was to inspire people to do things differently than how it had been historically done at NASA. For what was largely like a random process, everybody so exceeded my expectations,” Isaacman told CNN.

“But Polaris is a test and developmental program — and that appeals to my aviation background and things we’ve done in the past,” he added. “It’s set out (to) have ambitious objectives. So, you assemble the best crew you could for it.”

Anna Menon: A lifelong dream

Isaacman already knew Menon from the Inspiration4 mission: She was a technical adviser to the family members of that crew, explaining the complexities of spaceflight to loved ones on the ground.

Months after Inspiration4 came back to Earth, she learned that Isaacman was planning his return.

“I found out about it through a meeting that was put on my calendar. … I suddenly start to feel like this is not the average meeting (and) very quickly, Jared asked if I would like to go on his next mission,” Menon said. “I was just completely surprised. Absolutely never would have seen this coming in my entire life.”

But Menon said she has longed to travel to space, which captured her imagination during a trip to Johnson Space Center in Houston as a fourth grader.

“I got to experience a day in the life of an astronaut and a mission control and flight controller,” she told CNN. “And from that time on, I did dream of having that opportunity.”

Menon’s passion led to a master’s degree in biomedical engineering from Duke University and a seven-year stint at NASA, working as a biomedical flight controller for the International Space Station.

After switching to a role at SpaceX, she served in mission control during some of the company’s highest-profile missions, including 2020’s Demo-2 — the inaugural crewed flight of SpaceX’s Dragon capsule that returned astronaut launches to US soil for the first time in a decade.

Still, Menon told CNN, she did not anticipate traveling to space.

“I think I very much recognized the odds were extremely low,” she said. “And I probably, if I’m honest with myself, had written it off.”

But spaceflight now appears to run in the family. Just days before Menon learned she would join the Polaris Dawn crew, her husband — Anil Menon, who also worked with the Inspiration4 crew as a SpaceX employee — was selected as a NASA astronaut. (He has not been assigned to his first mission.)

“It was an absolute whirlwind of a week in our household,” Anna Menon said. “I called him up right after I got out of the meeting with Jared, and I just remember his reaction being extreme shock and such excitement — over the moon excited.”

Their two children, now 4 and 6 years old, have watched as their parents trained to take on risky challenges. Menon said her eldest is just beginning to grasp the gravity of the situation.

Menon also coauthored a book for them, called “Kisses From Space,” that she plans to read aloud during the mission as part of a fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

Menon will be a mission specialist during the Polaris Dawn flight, helping to carry out science experiments during the trip, and she’ll be the mission’s medical officer.

If space adaptation syndrome — a type of severe motion sickness that can strike astronauts — hits the crew, it will be up to Menon to administer medication that can alleviate those symptoms.

Sarah Gillis: From intern to astronaut

Dealing with — and searching for answers to — the daunting biological challenges that humans face while floating in a spacecraft is another cornerstone goal of the Polaris Dawn mission.

Some of this mission’s science experiments are geared toward a better understanding of space adaptation syndrome and predicting whom it will affect.

As a lead operations engineer at SpaceX, Gillis has taken the reins on training astronauts for crucial missions. Among her trainees were the first astronauts to fly in a Crew Dragon capsule — NASA’s Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley — before the historic Demo-2 mission in 2020.

Gillis also trained the Inspiration4 crew for its 2021 mission, and she saw firsthand how spaceflight can take a toll.

Isaacman has said two of the crew members on Inspiration4 experienced space adaptation syndrome (about 1 in 2 people do), and there were issues with the Crew Dragon toilet that threatened the team’s comfort during its 3-day trip.

“Human spaceflight is not going to be glamorous all the time. Humans aren’t meant to live and work without gravity.” - Sarah Gillis, SpaceX Lead Operations Engineer

“I’m really, really interested to see how (being in microgravity) goes for me and what I learn and bring back to the training program at SpaceX,” Gillis told CNN.

Like Menon, Gillis was shocked to learn about possible space travel during a meeting that popped up on her calendar in late 2021.

“It was a pretty wild, random workday,” Gillis said, “but I think my immediate response was, ‘Hell yes.’”

During her career at SpaceX, where she has worked for nearly a decade, Gillis helped develop the company’s Crew Dragon operations process and has been close to the sidelines of human spaceflight.

Despite her proximity to those missions, however, Gillis said she never imagined she would fly aboard the capsule to which she has dedicated much of her professional career.

“I think human spaceflight captivated my imagination, and that’s why I tried to pursue things that interested me in that field,” she told CNN. “(But) I don’t think in any of this, I considered it was possible.”

Gillis did not grow up dreaming of cosmic adventures. She’s a trained violinist who did not seriously consider a career in space until her junior year of high school, when she met NASA astronaut Joe Tanner. He helped her with a senior project and encouraged her to pursue engineering in college.

“I ultimately applied for aerospace engineering at (the University of Colorado Boulder) because of that,” she said, “and ended up down this whole journey of becoming an intern at SpaceX, and then, many years later, getting to fly on the spacecraft.”

Gillis and Menon have spent the last several years splitting time between their day jobs at SpaceX — leaving their fingerprints on the hardware that will carry them to space — and training for the Polaris Dawn mission.

“Now, I would say, over the last couple months, we’ve transitioned to full-time crew members,” Gillis added.

Scott ‘Kidd’ Poteet: ‘Zero reservations’

Poteet has been along for the ride throughout Isaacman’s pursuit of space ambitions.

Their friendship stems from experiences in the air: Poteet spent 20 years in the Air Force, racking up about 3,200 hours of jet flight experience. And Isaacman is a passionate pilot with thousands of hours of experience flying jets and experimental aircraft.

Poteet went to work for Isaacman after meeting him at an air show. Poteet joined Draken International, a tactical fighter aircraft supplier and contractor for the US military that Isaacman founded in 2012.

Draken provided a “bad guy” service, Poteet said, using jets to role-play as enemies during military training. It commercialized a role that Poteet had also played in the Air Force.

That experiencelasted about five years, Poteet said, before Isaacman sold the company.

Since Isaacman shifted focus spaceward, he and Poteet have been in lockstep. During Inspiration4, Poteet was the mission director. But Poteet said he did not imagine a ride to space would be within his grasp.

“I was not the best academic student growing up — grade school through high school,” Poteet told CNN. “But I admired all the astronauts and the NASA programs: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo leading up to the shuttle era.”

But as a former operational test pilot, Poteet said he understood Isaacman’s desire to push boundaries and help SpaceX take ambitious leaps forward in its commercial spaceflight capabilities.

“Similar to (SpaceX CEO) Elon (Musk), Jared has got visions of: How do we continue to push the envelope and move the needle on space exploration?” Poteet said. “The end result was the Polaris program.”

“I was a firm believer in what (Isaacman) had envisioned,” Poteet added.

The Polaris Dawn mission came together in 2 ½ years, breakneck speed as far as aerospace timelines typically go.

Poteet said that this mission shows what the SpaceX team can “accomplish in a very short few years (and) is a true testament to its professionalism.”

“I have absolutely zero reservations,” Poteet said about making his foray into space. “I have full faith and confidence that they’ve crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I’ in preparation for our mission.”"
science,SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn aims for another launch attempt,2024-09-09,Jackie Wattles,"SpaceX is making another attempt to get Polaris Dawn — a risky mission that will send four civilians into the radiation belts and on a historic spacewalk — off the ground this week.

The daring flight will aim to take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida no earlier than 3:38 a.m. ET Tuesday, with additional launch opportunities at 5:23 a.m. ET and 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday. A SpaceX webcast of the event is expected begin around midnight the morning of the liftoff.

Additional launch opportunities are available in the early hours of Wednesday morning, according to SpaceX.

Previous attempts in late August to launch the Polaris Dawn mission were thwarted by a ground system issue at the launch site and weather delays. And weather could again prevent the unprecedented journey from kicking off Tuesday.

The latest forecast puts the odds of unfavorable launch conditions at 60%, according to a Sunday post made by SpaceX on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

Mission controllers are also closely watching the weather outlook off the coast of Florida, where the Polaris Dawn crew will splash down at one of several locations after its five-day trip to space.

“(C)onditions at the possible splashdown sites for Dragon’s return to Earth remain a watch item,” according to SpaceX.

Despite the forecasts, Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of payment platforms company Shift4, said Sunday on X, “This is a big improvement over the last two weeks. We are getting closer to getting this mission to orbit.”

Isaacman, who is both funding this mission alongside SpaceX and a crew member serving as mission commander, previously made clear how crucial it is for Polaris Dawn to take flight with pristine weather conditions on the horizon for the crew’s return.

Because the team will rely heavily on oxygen supplies during preparations for and while executing a spacewalk, the Polaris Dawn mission will have only about five or six days’ worth of oxygen supplies on board, necessitating an on-time return, according to Isaacman.

The spacewalk, which is scheduled to kick off at the start of the Polaris Dawn crew’s third day of flight, will mark the first time that a private crew of civilians has carried out extravehicular activities, or EVA, in space.

A perilous journey

Joining Isaacman on this flight are close friend and former US Air Force pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet as well as SpaceX engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis.

Adding to the risk of the Polaris Dawn team, the crew cabin will travel out into the first band of Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts after the mission takes flight — the first human spaceflight mission to travel that far since NASA’s Apollo program ended in 1972.

SpaceX is also juggling Polaris Dawn with other obligations at its launch site in Florida.

The company is expected to help get NASA’s Europa Clipper — a notable robotic mission set to explore an icy moon orbiting Jupiter — on its way in October.

But SpaceX’s launch site in Florida is currently set up for a crewed spaceflight — with the pad configured for a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon and the special crew access arm that allows astronauts to board the vehicle before flight.

Before Europa Clipper gets off the ground, SpaceX will have to convert the launchpad to accommodate a Falcon Heavy, a larger vehicle that has three times more power than a Falcon 9.

NASA is expected to give an update on the Europa Clipper mission at 4 p.m. ET Monday."

CNN —

Well-preserved fossils of ancient large reptiles called pterosaurs have revealed that some species flew by flapping their wings, while others soared like vultures, according to a new study.

Pterosaurs dominated the skies during the time of the dinosaurs and met the same deadly fate 66 million years ago after an asteroid strike triggered a mass extinction event. Some of the largest pterosaur species were giants that reached the size of small airplanes and stood to heights comparable to giraffes, causing researchers to question whether pterosaurs were even capable of flight.

The newly discovered fossils preserved 3D structures within the delicate wing bones, which typically are found flattened like pancakes within rock layers.

CT scans of the fossils provided a rare glimpse inside the wing bones belonging to two species of pterosaurs, including one new to science.

The results of the research, published Friday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, shed light on a remarkable and unexpected finding: Not only could giant pterosaurs fly, but different species adapted varied flight styles.

Intact fossils offer window to the past

The fossils date back 66 million to 72 million years in the late Cretaceous Period. The team initially found the specimens in 2007 at two sites in the north and south of what’s now Jordan, buried in deposits from an ancient landmass called Afro-Arabia that once included Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

After realizing the hollow bones still contained their original structures, the research team was eager to analyze them using high-resolution CT scans, said lead study author Dr. Kierstin Rosenbach, paleontologist and researcher within the department of Earth and environmental sciences at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

Some of the fossils belonged to a giant pterosaur known as Arambourgiania philadelphiae and provided a first look at its bone structure, as well as confirmation that it had a wingspan of 32.8 feet (10 meters). The team noted a series of ridges that spiraled up and down its hollow humerus bone.

The remaining fossils were part of a pterosaur that is new to science called Inabtanin alarabia. It’s named after the large grape-colored hill, Tal Inab, where it was unearthed. The name combines the Arabic words “inab,” for grape, and “tanin,” for dragon, while “Alarabia” refers to the Arabian Peninsula.

Inabtanin alarabia is one of the most complete pterosaur fossils ever found from this region, according to the researchers. The reptile was smaller than Arambourgiania with a wingspan of 16.4 feet (5 meters).

When the researchers scanned the flight bones, they realized they were looking at a completely different structure than that of Arambourgiania.

The flight bones for Inabtanin included an interior structure of struts, or strengthening rods that helped them fly. These are not unlike those found in the wing bones of modern birds that flap their wings to fly, Rosenbach said.

In contrast, spiral ridges within Arambourgiania’s wing bones resembled the interiors of vulture wing bones, which are thought to resist the forces associated with soaring.

“The struts found in Inabtanin were cool to see, though not unusual,” Rosenbach said in a statement. “The ridges in Arambourgiania were completely unexpected, we weren’t sure what we were seeing at first.”

A diversity of pterosaur flight

The largest flying modern bird is the Andean condor, which has a wingspan of 9 feet (about 2.8 meters). But pterosaurs had massive wingspans that could reach 16.4 to 39.3 feet (5 to 12 meters).

“They represent the largest animals with the capacity to fly,” Rosenbach said of the extinct reptiles.

Discovering that pterosaurs adapted different flight styles is exciting because it provides insight into the behaviors and lifestyles of these ancient reptiles, the researchers said.

“I think they would look noticeably different if we could watch them fly side by side,” Rosenbach said. “Inabtanin would have been flapping its wings similar to modern birds, but Arambourgiania would more likely have been soaring with some wing flapping, much like a vulture or pelagic seabird.”

The fossils didn’t yield any insights into how the pterosaurs took off from the ground, but the team is using its findings to determine how these varied flight styles evolved.

“The variation in internal structure likely reflects the bone’s response to mechanical forces applied on the wings of pterosaurs,” said study coauthor Jeff Wilson Mantilla, curator and professor at the University of Michigan’s Museum of Paleontology.

The researchers can’t say for sure which style came first, although when looking at birds and bats, flapping is the most common, Rosenbach said. And even birds that soar or glide need some flapping to help them get up in the air and maintain flight.

Flight styles likely evolved due to a combination of factors, such as the pterosaurs’ environment, their body shape and size, and how they hunted for prey, the authors said.

The scientists found both fossils in areas where a large shallow sea once existed, so each species may have adapted different behaviors to forage in the same environment, Rosenbach said.

“This leads me to believe that flapping flight is the default condition, and that the behavior of soaring would perhaps evolve later if it were advantageous for the pterosaur population in a specific environment; in this case the open ocean,” she said.

An evolving look at ancient flight

Pterosaur wing bones had to cope with the strain of flight while remaining lightweight, which is why the hollow bones show different strengthening structures within their bone walls, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.

“This is a nice study of the structure of the vertebrae of two large pterosaurs, one big and one huge,” said Benton, who was not involved in the research. “It’s always been a mystery how pterosaurs could be light enough and yet strong enough to fly, especially the many examples that were much larger than any known bird. This paper helps to provide the answer.”

The study authors believe their findings submit new evidence to the ongoing debate among paleontologists on whether the most massive pterosaurs could fly.

“The internal bone structure of these fossils suggest that they experienced the mechanical forces associated with flight,” Rosenbach said. “We can think of these findings as one piece in the puzzle of growing evidence that large pterosaurs maintained the ability to fly at extremely large body sizes.”

The research team is eager for the chance to see more scans of pterosaur bones and determine how the newly discovered pterosaur Inabtanin relates to the rest of the ancient reptiles.

“There is growing evidence that pterosaurs were more diverse approaching the big Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event than we previously thought,” Rosenbach said via email, referring to the mass extinction of dinosaurs and most life on Earth. “This indicates that the extinction was catastrophic as opposed to a slow process of extinction for large reptiles.”"

As astronauts and engineers are fond of saying, space is hard. But that has never stopped bright minds from dreaming big.

A Seattle-based company has resurrected NASA’s plans for a space plane, abandoned in 2001 due to technical difficulties. Radian Aerospace wants to replace vertical rocket launches with planes that launch to space from a rocket-powered sled. Still, such reinvention won’t be easy.

Meanwhile, the fate of Boeing’s Starliner under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program — ultimately determining if it will become a spacecraft that could one day ferry astronauts to low-Earth orbit — hangs in the balance.

The spacecraft successfully launched and delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station in June. But what seemed like an eight-day jaunt turned into months of questions surrounding Starliner’s ability to return the crew safely to Earth.

Now, thruster issues have led NASA and Boeing to send Starliner back home without the two astronauts to conclude the mission before going back to the drawing board.

Defying gravity

After nearly three months, the Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without the two test pilots after undocking from the space station Friday night and parachuting into the New Mexico desert early Saturday.

Starliner is the first US-made capsule to parachute to a ground landing, rather than splashing into the ocean.

Wilmore and Williams watched their spacecraft depart and will remain on the orbiting laboratory until 2025.

“There’s a piece of us, all of us, that we wish it would have been the way we had planned it. We had planned to have the mission land with Butch and Suni on board,” said Steve Stich, manager for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.

Now that Starliner is back on Earth, Boeing engineers will study the spacecraft and determine what work needs to be done to solve the issues that cropped up during its initial flight to space. It remains to be seen how and when Starliner will be certified to carry astronauts regularly to space.

Ocean secrets

Researchers tagged a pregnant porbeagle shark off Cape Cod in Massachusetts to track her movements and see where she would give birth.

But five months later, her tag floated to the ocean’s surface, and the team realized a large predator had likely eaten the shark.

The research turned into a scientific murder mystery, and two likely suspects appeared in the waters where the porbeagle disappeared: great white and shortfin mako sharks.

The discovery reveals shark behavior is more complex than previously thought, and large sharks hunting one another may be a common behavior.

Wild kingdom

The Iberian lynx has come back from the brink of extinction after decades of conservation work — and new technology could ensure that Spain’s lynx population has a long future.

Habitat loss, a decline in food sources and road accidents were the lynx’s biggest obstacles. Then, the European Union and the Spanish government funded a hefty project to restore habitats and prey.

But the Iberian lynx remains threatened. To protect the cats from becoming roadkill on busy highways, conservationists are installing virtual fences equipped with sensors that use sound and light alarms. And in the future, scientists may engineer scent corridors that create artificial trails to connect different lynx populations.

Other worlds

An asteroid 20 times the size of the one that wiped out the dinosaurs could have slammed into Jupiter’s moon Ganymede 4 billion years ago, according to new research.

The massive impact might have caused the moon, which is the largest in the solar system, to shift on its axis.

Astronomers could uncover more answers about Ganymede’s history, as well as how the impact affected the global ocean beneath its icy surface, when the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft is set to arrive and study the moon in 2031.

Meanwhile, a small asteroid created a flash as it burned up in Earth’s atmosphere over the Philippines near Luzon Island this week.

Curiosities

The FD&C Yellow No. 5 dye, a common food coloring, was used at a low concentration in the study, and its effects were easily undone, according to the researchers. US NSF

Researchers were able to watch a mouse’s organs function after making its skin temporarily transparent using a common substance: yellow food dye mixed with water.

The scientists applied the mixture to the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice. Then the team was able to observe blood vessels directly in the brain’s surface as well as muscle contractions moving food through the digestive tracts.

When the light-absorbing dye mixes with water, it suppresses the skin tissue’s ability to scatter light.

The scientific breakthrough, similar to the plot of H.G. Wells “The Invisible Man,” could revolutionize biomedical research and make veins more visible for blood draws.

CNN —

Facing a crowd of journalists, inventor Thomas Midgley Jr. poured a lead additive over his hands and then proceeded to inhale its fumes for about a minute. Unfazed, he said, “I could do this every day without getting any health problems whatsoever.”

Soon afterward, Midgley needed medical treatment. But the act would have dire consequences beyond his own well-being.

The year was 1924, and Midgley, then a chemical engineer for General Motors, had pulled the stunt to support his most recent, lucrative finding: a lead compound called tetraethyl lead. Added to gasoline, it solved one of the biggest problems the automotive industry faced at the time — engine knocking, or tiny explosions in car engines due to the low quality of gasoline that resulted in an annoying sound and potential damage. Lead helped, but at great expense, because the substance is highly toxic to humans, especially children.

Midgley would go on to leave his mark in history with another destructive invention, also a solution to a problem: the need to replace the noxious and flammable gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. He found that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, were an ideal substitute and harmless to humans. However, they turned out to be deadly to the ozone in the atmosphere, which blocks dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers and other health problems, as well as harming plants and animals.

One hundred years after that stunt before the press in 1924, the planet is still recovering from the ill effects of both of Midgley’s inventions. The ozone layer will need another four decades to heal fully, and because leaded gasoline was still sold in parts of the world until 2021, many continue to live with the long-term effects of lead poisoning.

Yet Midgley — whose story will be told in an upcoming movie developed by the writer of the 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street” — was hailed as a hero for decades.

An inventor from his early days

Born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in 1889, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances early on. In high school, he used the chewed bark of the slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up.

He was known to carry with him at all times a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention.

The task of addressing the issue of engine knocking fell to Midgley while he was working at General Motors in 1916.

“It was the dawn of the automobile era in the United States, and Ford had developed the Model T, which was not very powerful,” said Gerald Markowitz, a history professor at the City University of New York. “GM joined with Standard Oil and DuPont to try to develop more powerful engines, and in order to do that they needed to solve the problem of the engines knocking with the fuel that they had at the time.”

Under the direction of Charles Kettering, another influential American inventor and head of research at GM, Midgley worked his way through thousands of substances — including arsenic, sulfur and silicon — in a quest to find one that reduced knocking when added to gasoline. He eventually landed on tetraethyl lead, a lead derivative that was marketed simply as Ethyl. Leaded gasoline first went on sale in Dayton, Ohio, in 1923 and eventually spread throughout the world.

Lead is highly poisonous, with no safe level of exposure, and can impair development in children, causing decreased intelligence and behavioral disorders, according to UNICEF. An estimated 1 million people a year still die from lead poisoning, according to the World Health Organization.

The toxicity of lead was already well-known when Midgley added it to gas, but that didn’t stop Ethyl from becoming a commercial success.

“There were alarms that were raised, because lead was known as a toxin,” Markowitz said. “But the position of the industry was that there was no proof that lead coming out of the tailpipes of cars was going to injure people. And it was that lack of proof that ultimately led the surgeon general not to take action after a public health conference in 1925.”

However, workers in Ethyl manufacturing quickly experienced ill effects.

“It was really the fact that the people working in the labs producing tetraethyl lead were getting sick that created a crisis,” Markowitz said. “They would literally go insane as a result of their exposure to lead.”

Midgley went as far as pouring Ethyl over his hands and inhaling it during that 1924 news conference in an attempt to quench fears.

But in reality, he was also getting poisoned.

“He definitely wrote in a letter in January of 1923 that he had a touch of lead poisoning, and he did have lead poisoning for the rest of his life,” said Bill Kovarik, a professor of communication at Radford University in Virginia. “It doesn’t really go away when you get that much lead in your body. It is a serious, long-term disability.”

Punching a hole

Just years after the invention of Ethyl, Midgley — again spurred by Kettering — turned his attention to developing a nontoxic, nonflammable alternative to refrigerant gases such as ammonia, which were used in appliances and air conditioners at the time, leading to a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s.

He came up with Freon — a derivative of methane, composed of carbon, chlorine and fluorine atoms — the first CFC. In another public demonstration, in 1930, Midgley inhaled the gas and blew out a candle with it, a move designed to show its safety.

Freon, as well as subsequent CFCs, became commercial successes, and made air conditioning adoption shoot up in the United States. After World War II, manufacturers started routinely using CFCs as propellants for all sorts of products, including insecticides and hair spray.

It was the mid-1970s, three decades after Midgley’s death, before the damage from his two inventions became publicly known. CFCs had punched a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica; if left unchecked, the hole would have expanded to the point of eventually threatening all life on Earth.

As a result of continued industry pressure, leaded gasoline was not phased out in the United States until 1996 and slowly thereafter throughout the world. The last nation to get rid of it, Algeria, still sold it until 2021, and lead additives continue to be used in aviation fuel. A 2022 study estimated that half of the current US population had been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in early childhood, but the damage to the world’s collective health is harder to quantify.

In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed to phase out CFCs from 1989 until 2010, after which they were banned. (CFC emissions have been rising again recently, a sign that they may still be produced illegally.) The hole in the ozone layer is on the mend and will likely heal in the next half–century in a rare environmental win.

“The very sad truth is that we don’t know especially the number of children who have been adversely affected,” Markowitz said. “There is no safe level of lead in a child’s body. We’re talking tens of millions of children, hundreds of millions of children over a half-century or more that have been affected adversely, their life chances diminished from lead dust as a result of the exhaust gases that got into the ground or into the streets.”

A tragic death

Midgley’s life ended under tragic circumstances. After contracting polio in 1940, he became severely disabled and devised yet another invention: a machine that would lift him out of bed and into a wheelchair autonomously, via strings and pulleys. But on November 2, 1944, he became entangled in the machine and died of strangulation.

Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.

For a long time, it was believed to have been the ultimate irony — the inventor dying by his own invention. But the reality may be even darker, according to Kovarik.

“The official cause of death was suicide,” he said. “He had a tremendous sense of guilt. The industry told him he was brilliant. But he did stuff that in hindsight was pretty irresponsible. The lead poisoning could have contributed to his psychosis.”

Midgley received several awards and honors in the late stages of his life. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded him the Perkin Medal in 1937; the American Chemical Society gave him the Priestley Medal in 1941 and elected him as president in the year of his death.

A biographical memoir from the National Academy of Sciences, written by his mentor Kettering in 1947, contains nothing but praise and ends by saying that Midgley left behind “a great heritage to the world from a busy, a diversified, and a highly creative life.”

History has other examples of inventions that turned out to be unwittingly deadly, such as TNT, which was originally developed for use as a yellow dye and not used as an explosive until decades later. Midgley is unique in having developed two such inventions, but although it’s tempting to see him as an environmental villain, experts say his role was more akin to a cog in the machine.

“He was just an employee,” Kovarik said.

Markowitz agrees. “This was corporate-sponsored research,” he said. “Had it not been Midgley, I’m sure it would have been somebody else who would have come up with these solutions.”

Striving for growth and innovation at all costs was reflective of the conception of progress in the first half of the 20th century, Markowitz added. “Only with the environmental movement that started in the 1960s and 1970s did we begin to consider what the consequences of technological progress could be,” he said.

“That has had a really sobering effect, but up through the 1950s there were very few voices questioning the idea that progress was our most important product.”"

science,Dyson spheres: Could alien megastructures exist in the Milky Way? Scientists found 7 places to look,2024-06-13,Jacopo Prisco,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

What would be the ultimate solution to the energy problems of an advanced civilization? Renowned British American physicist Freeman Dyson theorized it would be a shell made up of mirrors or solar panels that completely surrounds a star — harnessing all the energy it produces.

“One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star,” wrote Dyson in a 1960 paper in which he first explained the concept.

If it sounds like science fiction, that’s because it is: Dyson took the idea from Olaf Stapledon’s 1937 novel “Star Maker,” and he was always open about that. The late scientist was a professor emeritus at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Still, coming from a thinker who some in the scientific community say might have been worthy of a Nobel Prize early in his career, the concept took hold and the hypothetical megastructures became known as Dyson spheres, even though the physicist later clarified that they would actually consist of “a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star.”

In his paper, Dyson also noted that Dyson spheres would give off waste heat detectable as infrared radiation, and suggested that looking for that byproduct would be a viable method for searching for extraterrestrial life. However, he added that infrared radiation by itself would not necessarily mean extraterrestrial intelligence, and that one of the strongest reasons for searching for such sources was that new types of natural astronomical objects might be discovered.

“Scientists (at the time) were largely receptive, not to the likelihood that alien civilisations would be found to exist, but that a search for waste heat would be a good place to look,” said George Dyson, a technology writer and author and the second of Dyson’s six children, via email. “Science fiction, from ‘Footfall’ to ‘Star Trek,’ took the idea and ran with it, while social critics adopted the Dyson sphere as a vehicle for questioning the wisdom of unlimited technological growth.”

The elder Dyson himself argued, “It would be much more rewarding to search directly for intelligence, but technology is the only thing we have any chance of seeing.”

In the 1960s, there was no way to actually search for Dyson spheres, but in more recent times many researchers have looked for them, including those at the SETI Institute, a nonprofit organization with a mission to search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab. Now, a new study that looked at 5 million stars in the Milky Way galaxy suggests that seven candidates could potentially be hosting Dyson spheres — a finding that’s attracting scrutiny and alternate theories.

Possibilities

The authors of the study, published May 6 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, specifically set out to search for Dyson spheres, in the form of infrared heat near stars that couldn’t be explained in any other way.

Using historical data from telescopes that pick up infrared signatures, the research team looked at stars located within less than 1,000 light-years from Earth: “We started with a sample of 5 million stars, and we applied filters to try to get rid of as much data contamination as possible,” said lead study author Matías Suazo, a doctoral student in the department of physics and astronomy of Uppsala University in Sweden.

“So far, we have seven sources that we know are glowing in the infrared but we don’t know why, so they stand out.”

There is no conclusive evidence that the seven stars have Dyson spheres around them, Suazo cautioned.

“It’s difficult for us to find an explanation for these sources, because we don’t have enough data to prove what is the real cause of the infrared glow,” he said. “They could be Dyson spheres, because they behave like our models predict, but they could be something else as well.”

Among the natural causes that could explain the infrared glow are an unlucky alignment in the observation, with a galaxy in the background overlapping with the star, planetary collisions creating debris, or the fact that the stars may be young and therefore still surrounded by disks of hot debris from which planets would later form.

The data used by the researchers comes from two active space telescopes — the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, from NASA and Gaia from the European Space Agency — as well as an astronomical survey of the sky in infrared light called The Two Micron All Sky Survey. Also known as 2MASS, the collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and the US space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory took place between 1997 and 2001.

The candidate stars are all red dwarfs, the most common type of star in our galaxy. They are also dimmer and smaller than our sun, which makes follow-up observations more difficult. It’s unclear at this point whether the stars have planets around them, as they haven’t been observed yet by any of the telescopes that could potentially spot orbiting planets. However, many of the thousands of exoplanets scientists have identified so far orbit red dwarfs, which makes their presence likely; planets orbiting red dwarfs have a higher chance of being inhabitable, according to NASA.

An earlier study, published in March and using data from the same sources as the new report, had also found infrared anomalies among a sample dataset of 5 million stars in our galaxy.

A job for the Webb space telescope

“We got 53 candidates for anomalies that cannot be well explained, but can’t say that all of them are Dyson sphere candidates, because that’s not what we are specifically looking for,” said Gabriella Contardo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, who led the earlier study. She added that she plans to check the candidates against Suazo’s model to see how many tie into it.

“You need to eliminate all other hypotheses and explanations before saying that they could be a Dyson sphere,” she added. “To do so you need to also rule out that it’s not some kind of debris disk, or some kind of planetary collision, and that also pushes the science forward in other fields of astronomy — so it’s a win-win.”

Both Contardo and Suazo agree that more research is needed on the data, and that ultimately they could turn to NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope for more information, as it is powerful enough to observe the candidate stars directly. However, because of the lengthy, competitive procedures that regulate use of the telescope, securing access might take some time.

If Dyson spheres really exist, what could they be used for? “If you picture ourselves having as much energy as the sun is providing every second, we could do unheard of things,” Suazo said. “We could do interstellar travel, maybe we could even move the entire solar system to our preferred location, if we wanted.”

But don’t hold your breath, because the technology and the raw materials required to build the hypothetical structures are far beyond humanity’s grasp.

“They are so big that everything we have on Earth would not be enough to build them,” Suazo added. “Freeman Dyson said that we should dismantle Jupiter — the whole planet (for the raw materials).”

That supercolossal scale probably means that Dyson spheres, if they exist at all, are very rare.

“The importance of this work is that it provides the first strong evidence that there are not a lot of Dyson Spheres in our galaxy, contrary to the expectations of some that they might be an inevitable end-state of technological species’ expansion out into their solar systems,” said study coauthor Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University, via email.

“The candidates Matías (Suazo) has found are important because whatever they are — and they are likely stars surrounded by material from some sort of rare event, like a planetary collision, although they could be Dyson spheres — they are rare and interesting objects worthy of further study, for instance by the James Webb Space Telescope.”

Broken spheres

Dyson died in 2020 before any of his spheres could be found — although they are just one of a dozen ideas that bear his name.

“As a young scientist, Dyson showed that three competing quantum theories were actually the same theory — he summarily ended the competition,” said William Press, the Leslie Surginer Professor of Computer Science and Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. He was not involved in the study. “Later, he applied his genius to areas of astronomy, cosmology, the extraterrestrial realm, and also the very real problem of nuclear proliferation here on planet Earth. At the time of his death, he was recognized as a provocative and creative thinker.”

George Dyson also attested to his father’s fascination and comprehensive reach across disciplines.

“Taking advantage of a short attention span and an aversion to bureaucracy, he contributed to five fields of mathematics and eleven fields of physics, as well as to theoretical biology, engineering, operations research, literature, and public affairs,” the younger Dyson said. “Many of his ideas were controversial, with one of his guiding principles being that ‘It is better to be wrong than to be vague.’”

The approach of the researchers behind the new study could offer a more fruitful path in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, said Tomotsugu Goto, an associate professor of astronomy at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. He also was not involved with the study.

“However, contamination by circumstellar debris disks, which mimic Dyson Sphere infrared signatures, remains a concern,” he added in an email. “Authors argue that the debris disks around (dwarf stars) are rare, but the 7 candidate authors selected out of 5 million sources are also rare. Despite this, the seven candidates warrant further investigation with powerful telescopes for a more definitive evaluation.”

A May 23 paper published in response to the one by Suazo and his colleagues suggests that at least three of the seven stars have been “misidentified” as Dyson spheres and could instead be “hot DOGs” — hot dust-obscured galaxies — and that the remaining four could probably be explained this way as well.

Because Suazo’s study touches on the fundamental question of whether humankind is alone in the universe, the search for Dyson candidates straddles different fields — including basic sciences, philosophy and religion — and might therefore increase the involvement of young scientists and the interest of the scientific world in the topic, according to Zaza Osmanov, an affiliate of SETI and associate dean of the School of Physics at the Free University of Tbilisi in Georgia, who also was not involved with the research.

However, he added, the radiation fingerprint of the seven Dyson sphere candidates might be explained by natural phenomena as well. “The hypothesis of the artificial origin of any, even very interesting, radiation, should be the last springboard when all possible natural explanations are exhausted,” Osmanov said. “And for this, future research is necessary.”

As for Dyson himself, if he were still alive, he also would be highly skeptical that these observations represent a technological signature, his son George argued: “But the discovery of new, non-technological astronomical phenomena is exactly why he thought we should go out and look.”"

What would be the ultimate solution to the energy problems of an advanced civilization? Renowned British American physicist Freeman Dyson theorized it would be a shell made up of mirrors or solar panels that completely surrounds a star — harnessing all the energy it produces.

“One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star,” wrote Dyson in a 1960 paper in which he first explained the concept.

If it sounds like science fiction, that’s because it is: Dyson took the idea from Olaf Stapledon’s 1937 novel “Star Maker,” and he was always open about that. The late scientist was a professor emeritus at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Still, coming from a thinker who some in the scientific community say might have been worthy of a Nobel Prize early in his career, the concept took hold and the hypothetical megastructures became known as Dyson spheres, even though the physicist later clarified that they would actually consist of “a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star.”

CNN —

Perhaps the greatest, mind-bending quirk of our universe is the inherent trouble with timekeeping: Seconds tick by ever so slightly faster atop a mountain than they do in the valleys of Earth.

For practical purposes, most people don’t have to worry about those differences.

But a renewed space race has the United States and its allies, as well as China, dashing to create permanent settlements on the moon, and that has brought the idiosyncrasies of time, once again, to the forefront.

On the lunar surface, a single Earth day would be roughly 56 microseconds shorter than on our home planet — a tiny number that can lead to significant inconsistencies over time.

NASA and its international partners are currently grappling with this conundrum.

Scientists aren’t just looking to create a new “time zone” on the moon, as some headlines have suggested, said Cheryl Gramling, the lunar position, navigation, and timing and standards lead at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Rather, the space agency and its partners are looking to create an entirely new “time scale,” or system of measurement that accounts for that fact that seconds tick by faster on the moon, Gramling noted.

The agency’s goal is to work with international partners to set up a new method of tracking time, specifically for the moon, that space-faring nations agree to observe.

A recent memo from the White House also directed NASA to map out its plans for this new time scale by December 31, calling it “foundational” to renewed US efforts to explore the lunar surface. The memo also asks that NASA implement such a system by the end of 2026, the same year the space agency is aiming to return astronauts to the moon for the first time in five decades.

For the world’s timekeepers, the coming months could be crucial for figuring out how to accurately keep lunar time — and reach agreements on how, when and where to put clocks on the moon.

Such a framework will be crucial for humans visiting our closest celestial neighbor, Gramling told CNN.

Astronauts on the moon, for example, are going to leave their habitats to explore the surface and carry out science investigations, she said. They’re also going to be communicating with one another or driving their moon buggies while on the lunar surface.

“When they’re navigating relative to the moon,” Gramling said, “time needs to be relative to the moon.”

A brief history of Earth time

Simple sundials or stone formations, which track shadows as the sun passes overhead, mark a day’s progression just as the shifting phases of the moon can log the passing of a month on Earth. Those natural timekeepers have kept humans on schedule for millennia.

But perhaps since mechanical clocks gained traction in the early 14th century, clockmakers have grown ever more persnickety about precision.

Exacting the measurement of seconds also grew more complicated in the early 1900s, thanks to Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist who rocked the scientific community with his theories of special and general relativity.

“Darn that Einstein guy — he came up with general relativity, and many strange things come out of it,” said Dr. Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit space interest group. “One of them is that gravity slows time down.”

General relativity is complicated, but in broad terms, it’s a framework that explains how gravity affects space and time.

Imagine that our solar system is a piece of fabric suspended in the air. That fabric is space and time itself, which — under Einstein’s theories — are inextricably linked. And every celestial body within the solar system, from the sun to the planets, is like a heavy ball sitting atop the fabric. The heavier the ball, the deeper the divot it creates, warping space and time.

Even the idea of an earthly “second” is a humanmade concept that’s tricky to measure. And it was Einstein’s theory of general relativity that explained why time passes slightly more slowly at lower elevations — because gravity has a stronger effect closer to a massive object (such as our home planet).

Scientists have found a modern solution to all the complications of relativity for timekeeping on Earth: To account for imperceptible differences, they have set up a few hundred atomic clocks at various locations across the globe. Atomic clocks are ultra-precise instruments that use the vibration of atoms to measure the passage of time, and those clocks — in line with Einstein’s theories — tick slower the closer to Earth’s surface they sit.

The readings from atomic clocks around the world can be averaged for a broad but accurate as possible sense of time for planet Earth as a whole, giving us Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. Still, occasionally “leap seconds” are factored in to keep UTC in line with slight changes in Earth’s speed of rotation.

This methodical keeping of time helps make the modern world go round — metaphorically speaking, said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator and program manager for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program.

“If you’ve researched time on the Earth, you realize it is the critical enabler for everything: the economy, food security, trading, the financial community, even oil exploration. They use precise clocks,” Coggins said. “It’s in everything that matters in modern society.”

Space, time: The continual question

If time moves differently on the peaks of mountains than the shores of the ocean, you can imagine that things get even more bizarre the farther away from Earth you travel.

To add more complication: Time also passes slower the faster a person or spacecraft is moving, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity.

Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, are lucky, said Dr. Bijunath Patla, a theoretical physicist with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, in a phone interview. Though the space station orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, it also travels at high speeds — looping the planet 16 times per day — so the effects of relativity somewhat cancel each other out, Patla said. For that reason, astronauts on the orbiting laboratory can easily use Earth time to stay on schedule.

For other missions — it’s not so simple.

Fortunately, scientists already have decades of experience contending with the complexities.

Spacecraft, for example, are equipped with their own clocks called oscillators, Gramling said.

“They maintain their own time,” Gramling said. “And most of our operations for spacecraft — even spacecraft that are all the way out at Pluto, or the Kuiper Belt, like New Horizons — (rely on) ground stations that are back on Earth. So everything they’re doing has to correlate with UTC.”

But those spacecraft also rely on their own kept time, Gramling said. Vehicles exploring deep into the solar system, for example, have to know — based on their own time scale — when they are approaching a planet in case the spacecraft needs to use that planetary body for navigational purposes, she added.

For 50 years, scientists have also been able to observe atomic clocks that are tucked aboard GPS satellites, which orbit Earth about 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) away — or about one-nineteenth the distance between our planet and the moon.

Studying those clocks has given scientists a great starting point to begin extrapolating further as they set out to establish a new time scale for the moon, Patla said.

“We can easily compare (GPS) clocks to clocks on the ground,” Patla said, adding that scientists have found a way to gently slow GPS clocks down, making them tick more in-line with Earth-bound clocks. “Obviously, it’s not as easy as it sounds, but it’s easier than making a mess.”

For the moon, however, scientists likely won’t seek to slow clocks down. They hope to accurately measure lunar time as it is — while also ensuring it can be related back to Earth time, according to Patla, who recently co-authored a paper detailing a framework for lunar time.

The study, for the record, also attempted to pinpoint exactly how far apart moon and Earth time are, as estimates have wavered between 56 and 59 microseconds per day.

Clocks on the moon’s equator would tick 56.02 microseconds faster per day than clocks at the Earth’s equator, according to the paper.

Lunar clockwork

What scientists know for certain is that they need to get precision timekeeping instruments to the moon.

Exactly who pays for lunar clocks, which type of clocks will go, and where they’ll be positioned are all questions that remain up in the air, Gramling said.

“We have to work all of this out,” she said. “I don’t think we know yet. I think it will be an amalgamation of several different things.”

Atomic clocks, Gramling noted, are great for long-term stability, and crystal oscillators have an advantage for short-term stability.

“You never trust one clock,” Gramling added. “And you never trust two clocks.”

Clocks of various types could be placed inside satellites that orbit the moon or perhaps at the precise locations on the lunar surface that astronauts will one day visit.

As for price, an atomic clock worthy of space travel could cost around a few million dollars, according Gramling, with crystal oscillators coming in substantially cheaper.

But, Patla said, you get what you pay for.

“The very cheap oscillators may be off by milliseconds or even 10s of milliseconds,” he added. “And that is important because for navigation purposes — we need to have the clocks synchronized to 10s of nanoseconds.”

A network of clocks on the moon could work in concert to inform the new lunar time scale, just as atomic clocks do for UTC on Earth.

(There will not, Gramling added, be different time zones on the moon. “There have been conversations about creating different zones, with the answer: ‘No,’” she said. “But that could change in the future.”)

The new time scale would underpin an entire lunar network, which NASA and its allies have dubbed LunaNet.

“You can think of LunaNet like the internet — or the internet and a global navigation satellite system all combined,” Gramling said. It’s “a framework of standards that contributors to LunaNet (such as NASA or the European Space Agency) would follow.”

“And you can think of the contributors maybe as your internet service provider,” Gramling added.

Creating such a framework means bringing a lot of people across the world to the table. So far, Gramling said, conversations with US partners have been “very, very positive.”

It’s not clear whether NASA and its partners on this effort, which include the European Space Agency, will get a buy-in from nations that aren’t among US allies, such as China. Gramling noted those conversations would be held through international standard-setting bodies, such as the International Astronomical Union.

‘A whole different mindset’

Accurate clockwork is one matter. But how future astronauts living and working on the lunar surface will experience time is a different question entirely.

On Earth, our sense of one day is governed by the fact that the planet completes one rotation every 24 hours, giving most locations a consistent cycle of daylight and darkened nights. On the moon, however, the equator receives roughly 14 days of sunlight followed by 14 days of darkness.

“It’s just a very, very different concept” on the moon, Betts said. “And (NASA is) talking about landing astronauts in the very interesting south polar region (of the moon), where you have permanently lit and permanently shadowed areas. So, that’s a whole other set of confusion.”

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter captured this view of Malapert Massif on March 3, 2023. The lunar mountain is a potential landing site for Artemis III, a NASA mission that could launch as soon as 2026 and put astronauts on the moon for the first time in decades. NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University

“It’ll be challenging” for those astronauts, Betts added. “It’s so different than Earth, and it’s just a whole different mindset.”

That will be true no matter what time is displayed on the astronauts’ watches.

Still, precision timekeeping matters — not just for the sake of scientifically understanding the passage of time on the moon but also for setting up all the infrastructure necessary to carry out missions.

The beauty of creating a time scale from scratch, Gramling said, is that scientists can take everything they have learned about timekeeping on Earth and apply it to a new system on the moon.

And if scientists can get it right on the moon, she added, they can get it right later down the road if NASA fulfills its goal of sending astronauts deeper into the solar system.

“We are very much looking at executing this on the moon, learning what we can learn,” Gramling said, “so that we are prepared to do the same thing on Mars or other future bodies.”"

On the lunar surface, a single Earth day would be roughly 56 microseconds shorter than on our home planet — a tiny number that can lead to significant inconsistencies over time.

NASA and its international partners are currently grappling with this conundrum.

Scientists aren’t just looking to create a new “time zone” on the moon, as some headlines have suggested, said Cheryl Gramling, the lunar position, navigation, and timing and standards lead at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Rather, the space agency and its partners are looking to create an entirely new “time scale,” or system of measurement that accounts for that fact that seconds tick by faster on the moon, Gramling noted.

The agency’s goal is to work with international partners to set up a new method of tracking time, specifically for the moon, that space-faring nations agree to observe.

A recent memo from the White House also directed NASA to map out its plans for this new time scale by December 31, calling it “foundational” to renewed US efforts to explore the lunar surface. The memo also asks that NASA implement such a system by the end of 2026, the same year the space agency is aiming to return astronauts to the moon for the first time in five decades.

For the world’s timekeepers, the coming months could be crucial for figuring out how to accurately keep lunar time — and reach agreements on how, when and where to put clocks on the moon.

Such a framework will be crucial for humans visiting our closest celestial neighbor, Gramling told CNN.

Astronauts on the moon, for example, are going to leave their habitats to explore the surface and carry out science investigations, she said. They’re also going to be communicating with one another or driving their moon buggies while on the lunar surface.

“When they’re navigating relative to the moon,” Gramling said, “time needs to be relative to the moon.”

A brief history of Earth time

Simple sundials or stone formations, which track shadows as the sun passes overhead, mark a day’s progression just as the shifting phases of the moon can log the passing of a month on Earth. Those natural timekeepers have kept humans on schedule for millennia.

But perhaps since mechanical clocks gained traction in the early 14th century, clockmakers have grown ever more persnickety about precision.

Exacting the measurement of seconds also grew more complicated in the early 1900s, thanks to Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist who rocked the scientific community with his theories of special and general relativity.

“Darn that Einstein guy — he came up with general relativity, and many strange things come out of it,” said Dr. Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit space interest group. “One of them is that gravity slows time down.”

General relativity is complicated, but in broad terms, it’s a framework that explains how gravity affects space and time.

Imagine that our solar system is a piece of fabric suspended in the air. That fabric is space and time itself, which — under Einstein’s theories — are inextricably linked. And every celestial body within the solar system, from the sun to the planets, is like a heavy ball sitting atop the fabric. The heavier the ball, the deeper the divot it creates, warping space and time.

Even the idea of an earthly “second” is a humanmade concept that’s tricky to measure. And it was Einstein’s theory of general relativity that explained why time passes slightly more slowly at lower elevations — because gravity has a stronger effect closer to a massive object (such as our home planet).

Scientists have found a modern solution to all the complications of relativity for timekeeping on Earth: To account for imperceptible differences, they have set up a few hundred atomic clocks at various locations across the globe. Atomic clocks are ultra-precise instruments that use the vibration of atoms to measure the passage of time, and those clocks — in line with Einstein’s theories — tick slower the closer to Earth’s surface they sit.

The readings from atomic clocks around the world can be averaged for a broad but accurate as possible sense of time for planet Earth as a whole, giving us Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. Still, occasionally “leap seconds” are factored in to keep UTC in line with slight changes in Earth’s speed of rotation.

This methodical keeping of time helps make the modern world go round — metaphorically speaking, said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator and program manager for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program.

“If you’ve researched time on the Earth, you realize it is the critical enabler for everything: the economy, food security, trading, the financial community, even oil exploration. They use precise clocks,” Coggins said. “It’s in everything that matters in modern society.”

Space, time: The continual question

If time moves differently on the peaks of mountains than the shores of the ocean, you can imagine that things get even more bizarre the farther away from Earth you travel.

To add more complication: Time also passes slower the faster a person or spacecraft is moving, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity.

Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, are lucky, said Dr. Bijunath Patla, a theoretical physicist with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, in a phone interview. Though the space station orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, it also travels at high speeds — looping the planet 16 times per day — so the effects of relativity somewhat cancel each other out, Patla said. For that reason, astronauts on the orbiting laboratory can easily use Earth time to stay on schedule.

For other missions — it’s not so simple.

Fortunately, scientists already have decades of experience contending with the complexities.

Spacecraft, for example, are equipped with their own clocks called oscillators, Gramling said.

“They maintain their own time,” Gramling said. “And most of our operations for spacecraft — even spacecraft that are all the way out at Pluto, or the Kuiper Belt, like New Horizons — (rely on) ground stations that are back on Earth. So everything they’re doing has to correlate with UTC.”

But those spacecraft also rely on their own kept time, Gramling said. Vehicles exploring deep into the solar system, for example, have to know — based on their own time scale — when they are approaching a planet in case the spacecraft needs to use that planetary body for navigational purposes, she added.

For 50 years, scientists have also been able to observe atomic clocks that are tucked aboard GPS satellites, which orbit Earth about 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) away — or about one-nineteenth the distance between our planet and the moon.

Studying those clocks has given scientists a great starting point to begin extrapolating further as they set out to establish a new time scale for the moon, Patla said.

“We can easily compare (GPS) clocks to clocks on the ground,” Patla said, adding that scientists have found a way to gently slow GPS clocks down, making them tick more in-line with Earth-bound clocks. “Obviously, it’s not as easy as it sounds, but it’s easier than making a mess.”

For the moon, however, scientists likely won’t seek to slow clocks down. They hope to accurately measure lunar time as it is — while also ensuring it can be related back to Earth time, according to Patla, who recently co-authored a paper detailing a framework for lunar time.

The study, for the record, also attempted to pinpoint exactly how far apart moon and Earth time are, as estimates have wavered between 56 and 59 microseconds per day.

Clocks on the moon’s equator would tick 56.02 microseconds faster per day than clocks at the Earth’s equator, according to the paper.

Lunar clockwork

What scientists know for certain is that they need to get precision timekeeping instruments to the moon.

Exactly who pays for lunar clocks, which type of clocks will go, and where they’ll be positioned are all questions that remain up in the air, Gramling said.

“We have to work all of this out,” she said. “I don’t think we know yet. I think it will be an amalgamation of several different things.”

Atomic clocks, Gramling noted, are great for long-term stability, and crystal oscillators have an advantage for short-term stability.

“You never trust one clock,” Gramling added. “And you never trust two clocks.”

Clocks of various types could be placed inside satellites that orbit the moon or perhaps at the precise locations on the lunar surface that astronauts will one day visit.

As for price, an atomic clock worthy of space travel could cost around a few million dollars, according Gramling, with crystal oscillators coming in substantially cheaper.

But, Patla said, you get what you pay for.

“The very cheap oscillators may be off by milliseconds or even 10s of milliseconds,” he added. “And that is important because for navigation purposes — we need to have the clocks synchronized to 10s of nanoseconds.”

A network of clocks on the moon could work in concert to inform the new lunar time scale, just as atomic clocks do for UTC on Earth.

(There will not, Gramling added, be different time zones on the moon. “There have been conversations about creating different zones, with the answer: ‘No,’” she said. “But that could change in the future.”)

The new time scale would underpin an entire lunar network, which NASA and its allies have dubbed LunaNet.

“You can think of LunaNet like the internet — or the internet and a global navigation satellite system all combined,” Gramling said. It’s “a framework of standards that contributors to LunaNet (such as NASA or the European Space Agency) would follow.”

“And you can think of the contributors maybe as your internet service provider,” Gramling added.

Creating such a framework means bringing a lot of people across the world to the table. So far, Gramling said, conversations with US partners have been “very, very positive.”

It’s not clear whether NASA and its partners on this effort, which include the European Space Agency, will get a buy-in from nations that aren’t among US allies, such as China. Gramling noted those conversations would be held through international standard-setting bodies, such as the International Astronomical Union.

‘A whole different mindset’

Accurate clockwork is one matter. But how future astronauts living and working on the lunar surface will experience time is a different question entirely.

On Earth, our sense of one day is governed by the fact that the planet completes one rotation every 24 hours, giving most locations a consistent cycle of daylight and darkened nights. On the moon, however, the equator receives roughly 14 days of sunlight followed by 14 days of darkness.

“It’s just a very, very different concept” on the moon, Betts said. “And (NASA is) talking about landing astronauts in the very interesting south polar region (of the moon), where you have permanently lit and permanently shadowed areas. So, that’s a whole other set of confusion.”

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter captured this view of Malapert Massif on March 3, 2023. The lunar mountain is a potential landing site for Artemis III, a NASA mission that could launch as soon as 2026 and put astronauts on the moon for the first time in decades.

“It’ll be challenging” for those astronauts, Betts added. “It’s so different than Earth, and it’s just a whole different mindset.”

That will be true no matter what time is displayed on the astronauts’ watches.

Still, precision timekeeping matters — not just for the sake of scientifically understanding the passage of time on the moon but also for setting up all the infrastructure necessary to carry out missions.

The beauty of creating a time scale from scratch, Gramling said, is that scientists can take everything they have learned about timekeeping on Earth and apply it to a new system on the moon.

And if scientists can get it right on the moon, she added, they can get it right later down the road if NASA fulfills its goal of sending astronauts deeper into the solar system.

“We are very much looking at executing this on the moon, learning what we can learn,” Gramling said, “so that we are prepared to do the same thing on Mars or other future bodies.”"

CNN —

Scientist Dr. Randal Voss gets the occasional reminder that he’s working with a kind of superstar. When he does outreach events with his laboratory, he encounters people who are keen to meet his research subjects: aquatic salamanders called axolotls.

The amphibians’ fans tell Voss that they know the animals from the internet, or from caricatures or stuffed animals, exclaiming, “‘They’re so adorable, we love them,’” said Voss, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. “People are drawn to them.”

Take one look at an axolotl, and it’s easy to see why it’s so popular. With their wide eyes, upturned mouths and pastel pink coloring, axolotls look cheerful and vaguely Muppet-like.

They’ve skyrocketed in pop culture fame, in part thanks to the addition of axolotls to the video game Minecraft in 2021. These unusual salamanders are now found everywhere from Girl Scout patches to hot water bottles. But there’s more to axolotls than meets the eye: Their story is one of scientific discovery, exploitation of the natural world, and the work to rebuild humans’ connection with nature.

A scientific mystery

Axolotl is a word from Nahuatl, the Indigenous Mexican language spoken by the Aztecs and an estimated 1.5 million people today. The animals are named for the Aztec god Xolotl, who was said to transform into a salamander. The original Nahuatl pronunciation is “AH-show-LOAT”; in English, “ACK-suh-LAHT-uhl” is commonly used.

Axolotls are members of a class of animals called amphibians, which also includes frogs. Amphibians lay their jelly-like eggs in water, and the eggs hatch into water-dwelling larval states. (In frogs, these larvae are called tadpoles.)

Most amphibians, once they reach adulthood, are able to move to land. Since they breathe, in part, by absorbing oxygen through their moist skin, they tend to stay near water.

Axolotls, however, never complete the metamorphosis to a land-dwelling adult form and spend their whole lives in the water.

“They maintain their juvenile look throughout the course of their life,” Voss said. “They’re teenagers, at least in appearance, until they die.”

A signature feature of the axolotls’ forever-young look is their frilled external gills, which help them breathe in their watery home — the only spot they’re found in the wild: Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City.

It’s a bit of a scientific mystery why axolotls don’t transform into adult, land-dwelling versions of themselves. One hypothesis, according to Dr. Luis Zambrano, a professor of zoology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is that the environment in Lake Xochimilco had enough resources for the salamanders that “it was by far better for them not to expend energy transforming and stay in the lake.”

The 10-square-mile Lake Xochimilco is a unique body of water, a natural drainage basin with slightly salty water. More than 1,000 years ago, Xochimilca people in the region invented an agricultural system of human-made floating islands called chinampas. The chinampa system, with its drainage canals surrounding the islands, is still used by farmers called chinamperos today. The islands provided habitats and hiding places for the axolotls, which thrived among the chinampas for 1,000 years.

However, the chinampas of Lake Xochimilco are no longer thriving, and neither are the salamanders. “The problems started at the beginning of the last century,” Zambrano said.

Axolotl problems

As Mexico City grew and became more industrialized, the need for water brought pumps and pipes to the lake, and eventually, “it was like a bad, smelly pond with rotten water,” Zambrano said. “All of our aquatic animals suffer with bad water quality, but amphibians suffer more because they have to breathe with the skin.”

To add to the axolotls’ problems, invasive fish species such as carp and tilapia were introduced to the lake, where they feed on axolotl eggs. And a 1985 earthquake in Mexico City displaced thousands of people, who found new homes in the area around the lake, further contributing to the destruction of the axolotls’ habitat.

These combined threats have devastated axolotl populations. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are fewer than 100 adult axolotls left in the wild. The species is considered critically endangered.

While the wild axolotls of Lake Xochimilco have dwindled to near-extinction, countless axolotls have been bred for scientific laboratories and the pet trade. “The axolotl essentially helped establish the field of experimental zoology,” Voss said.

In 1864, a French army officer brought live axolotls back to Europe, where scientists were surprised to learn that the seemingly juvenile aquatic salamanders were capable of reproduction. Since then, scientists around the world have studied axolotls and their DNA to learn about the salamanders’ unusual metamorphosis (or lack thereof) as well as their ability to regrow injured body parts.

In addition to their role in labs, axolotls have become popular in the exotic pet trade (though they are illegal to own in California, Maine, New Jersey and Washington, DC). However, the axolotls you might find at a pet shop are different from their wild relatives in Lake Xochimilco. Most wild axolotls are a dark grayish brown. The famous pink axolotls, as well as other color variants such as white, blue, yellow and black, are genetic anomalies that are rare in the wild but selectively bred for in the pet trade.

What’s more, “most of the animals in the pet trade have a very small genetic variance,” Zambrano said. Pet axolotls tend to be inbred and lack the wide flow of different genes that makes up a healthy population in the wild. That means that the axolotl extinction crisis can’t simply be solved by dumping pet axolotls into Lake Xochimilco. (Plus, the pet axolotls likely wouldn’t fare well with the poor habitat conditions in the lake.)

Fame and misfortune

The difficulties that axolotls face in the wild are almost diametrically opposed to the fame they’ve found in recent years. Axolotls have captured the human imagination for centuries, as evidenced by their roles in Aztec religion and stories, but the early 21st century seems to be a high point for them. An axolotl graces the 50 peso bill. There are axolotl-inspired Pokemon, and Reddit commenters have noted that the character Toothless from the “How to Train Your Dragon” movie series is distinctly axolotl-like.

The introduction of axolotls to Minecraft in 2021 neatly mapped onto an uptick in Google searches for the animals, and social media makes it easy for people to gain access to photos and videos of the salamanders, particularly the photogenic pink ones often kept as pets.

The axolotl pet trade probably doesn’t directly harm the wild populations since wild salamanders aren’t being poached or taken from Lake Xochimilco. However, Zambrano said, axolotls’ ubiquity in pop culture and pet stores might make people assume that because axolotls “live in all the tanks around the world, they are not in danger.”

Zambrano has been working in axolotl conservation for more than two decades. It’s a somewhat unusual challenge, he said, because axolotls live so closely to so many people, so the answer to saving them isn’t simply to create a wildlife preserve and keep people out.

“We have to be inventive in terms of the new ways of restoration and resilience and sustainable decisions,” he said.

These new practices include outreach efforts that aim for “synergy between local knowledge and scientific knowledge,” Zambrano said, especially among the chinamperos whose families have farmed the islands in Lake Xochimilco for generations.

A widespread return to the chinampa system, he said, would benefit the axolotls, because it would ensure cleaner habitat space for the salamanders than the lake’s current, more industrial uses provide.

Such efforts would require policy changes, but according to Zambrano, worldwide enthusiasm for the axolotls could bolster such a campaign. People who love them can even symbolically adopt an axolotl to help fund conservation programs. Getting people to recognize that their favorite, friendly faced salamander doesn’t just exist in the vacuum of the internet, but in the real world where it faces dire conservation challenges, Zambrano said, is “a huge achievement.”

science,Boeing Starliner capsule returns home from space — without astronauts on board,2024-09-06,"Jackie Wattles, Ashley Strickland","Relive the Boeing Starliner capsule’s return home as it happened.

CNN —

Boeing’s Starliner capsule returned from the International Space Station Friday evening — concluding its nearly three-month stay in space. But it flew back to Earth with an empty cabin, leaving behind two test pilots who must now remain on the station for another five or six months.

The Starliner left its docking port at the space station just after 6 p.m. ET, according to NASA. The capsule spent about six hours free-flying through orbit as it slowly made its descent toward home.

This screengrab taken from a video shows Boeing Starliner as it touches down in White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico, at 12:01 a.m. ET on September 7. NASA

Before the capsule departed, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — the two NASA astronauts who flew Starliner to the space station back in June — wished the spacecraft, nicknamed “Calypso” by Williams, luck on its long-awaited and unexpected journey home.

“It is time to bring Calypso home,” Williams said to mission control Friday evening. “You have got this. We have your backs, and you’ve got this. Bring her back to Earth.”

Close to midnight, the capsule reached one of the most important and treacherous legs of its test flight: reentry. The milestone required the Starliner to carefully orient itself as it plunged into the thickest part of Earth’s atmosphere while still traveling at orbital speeds — typically more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,400 kilometers per hour).

As with every spacecraft that returns from orbit, the pressure and friction of reentry put immense strain on the vehicle. The process could have heated up the spacecraft’s exterior to more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius).

Then, as the Starliner fell through the air, a set of parachutes — which Boeing redesigned and tested as recently as January — slowed the capsule before the vehicle deployed airbags for a gentle touchdown on terra firma.

Starliner is the first US-made capsule to parachute to a landing on the ground rather than splash down in the ocean. Boeing hopes that approach will make it easier to recover and refurbish the spacecraft after flight.

The vehicle landed in New Mexico at the White Sands Space Harbor, an area within a vast missile range of the same name that was previously used to train NASA space shuttle pilots. Starliner hit its mark at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday, according to the space agency.

“I want to recognize the work the Starliner teams did to ensure a successful and safe undocking, deorbit, reentry and landing,” said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program. “We will review the data and determine the next steps for the program.”

During a news briefing after the landing, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said that it’s not clear exactly what the path forward for Starliner looks like — or when the spacecraft could return to flight. That will “take a little time,” he said.

However, he added: “Now we’ve landed a capsule in the US on land. The entry in particular has been darn near flawless, so that — I wouldn’t say it surprised me — but as I step back and think about the mission, the entry itself was just, and the deorbit burn was spot on.”

Stich also acknowledged that if on-the-ground modeling were perfect, perhaps NASA would have trusted Starliner to bring Wilmore and Williams home on the vehicle’s return flight.

“If we’d had a model that would have predicted what we saw tonight perfectly, yeah, it looks like an easy decision to go say we could have had a crewed flight — but we didn’t have that,” Stitch said.

“From a human perspective, all of us feel happy about the successful landing,” he said. “But then there’s a piece of us, all of us, that we wish it would have been the way we had planned it. We had planned to have the mission land with Butch and Suni on board.”

Starliner’s troubled test flight

At first, NASA officials expressed confidence they could pinpoint Starliner’s issues and hash out a plan to safely return the vehicle with crew. But two lingering issues ultimately derailed those plans.

Concern about Starliner’s ability to hold a precise orientation while reentering Earth’s atmosphere — given several issues that cropped up during the first leg of its trip — was one of the reasons NASA opted not to fly Starliner’s crew home with the vehicle. Instead, Williams and Wilmore will stay aboard the space station and catch a ride home on a SpaceX capsule in 2025.

First, a series of helium leaks sprang up during Starliner’s outbound flight in early June. Helium is used to pressurize some of the vehicle’s thrusters, which help the spacecraft stay oriented in space, and problems with some of the helium spilling out delayed this crewed test mission even before takeoff.

Separately, five of Starliner’s 28 “reaction control system” (RCS) thrusters abruptly stopped working en route to the space station. Four were ultimately recovered, but at least one remained out of service for the entire mission.

NASA and Boeing kept the Starliner in space for weeks as they worked to understand those problems, stretching William’s and Wilmore’s stay from the expected length of about eight days to months.

At one point, NASA and Boeing said they believed they understood the likely cause of Starliner’s problems. The “doghouses,” or structures that contain propulsion equipment, were flying hotter than expected, causing some Teflon seals within the thruster systems to bulge — restricting the flow of propellant and causing the RCS thruster outages. Separately, officials said, the helium leaks might have been caused by seals that became degraded by exposure to propellant vapor.

Determining the root cause of a spacecraft issue, however, is not a perfect science.

And even if the issues were well understood, the Starliner team had to face the fact that it would never get to inspect the propulsion system on the actual vehicle in space. It was impossible to survey the problem as the Starliner sat attached to the space station.

What’s more, the unit that houses the troubled RCS thrusters and the helium leaks — called the service module — was not intended to survive the trip home. Instead, the service module, which is a cylindrical attachment at the bottom of the crew cabin, was designed to be ejected and disposed of on the way back to Earth. And it did just that on this mission.

The risks ahead

The ambiguity surrounding what exactly happened to the service module’s components was one key factor in NASA’s decision to fly the vehicle home without its crew.

“The bottom line relative to bringing Starliner back is — there was just too much uncertainty in the prediction of the thrusters,” Stitch said on August 24. “It was just too much risk with the crew, and so we decided to pursue the uncrewed path forward.”

During Starliner’s perilous return to Earth, the capsule did have other types of thrusters meant to help the vehicle keep its orientation as it traveled through space.

Alongside the 28 RCS thrusters are 20 “Orbital Maneuvering and Attitude Control” — or OMAC — thrusters, each of which has about 17 times the thrust of an RCS thruster.

But during a previous news conference, Stich described how the problems already identified on the Starliner’s service module might combine to create a disaster scenario.

“The worst case would be some integrated failure mechanism between the helium leaks and the RCS thrusters,” Stich said. “For a nominal de-orbit burn, we fire 10 OMAC thrusters in each of the four doghouses, and then the RCS jets are just there to hold the orientation.”

During Starliner’s final descent Friday, a series of checks carried out by teams on the ground showed that one of the thrusters on board the Starliner capsule itself had petered out.

Previous thruster outages that troubled the Boeing and NASA teams revolved around hardware located on Starliner’s service module — a cylindrical attachment that sits at the Starliner capsule’s base.

‘Remain vigilant’

During the August 24 news briefing, NASA officials also indicated that Boeing disagreed with some of the space agency’s risk assessments.

There was “just a little disagreement (between NASA and Boeing) in terms of the level of risk,” Stich said. “It just depends on how you evaluate the risk. … We did it a little differently with our crew than Boeing did.”

But Ken Bowersox, NASA’s associate administrator for the Space Operations Mission Directorate, added that the company had left the final decision up to NASA “because of our wider view of all the risks involved.”

Boeing said as recently as August 2 that its “confidence remains high” that Starliner could return with crew. But since NASA announced its decision to fly the capsule home without astronauts, the company has said only that it is focused on “executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return,” according to an August 24 statement.

How Starliner performed on its trip home could have broader implications for the future of the Boeing program. Already, the company has lost more than a billion dollars correcting issues with the vehicle, through years of delays, development setbacks and errors in flight.

It is not yet clear whether NASA will require Boeing to repeat this test flight — or if the space agency will consider certifying the spacecraft for regular flight after the mission’s safe landing.

Boeing has already had to repeat one test mission, an uncrewed test flight that took off in 2019. Software issues prevented the vehicle from entering the correct orbit and even reaching the International Space Station, prompting NASA to require Boeing to repeat the excursion in 2022.

CNN —

Boeing’s Starliner capsule returned from the International Space Station Friday evening — concluding its nearly three-month stay in space. But it flew back to Earth with an empty cabin, leaving behind two test pilots who must now remain on the station for another five or six months.

The Starliner left its docking port at the space station just after 6 p.m. ET, according to NASA. The capsule spent about six hours free-flying through orbit as it slowly made its descent toward home.

Before the capsule departed, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — the two NASA astronauts who flew Starliner to the space station back in June — wished the spacecraft, nicknamed “Calypso” by Williams, luck on its long-awaited and unexpected journey home.

“It is time to bring Calypso home,” Williams said to mission control Friday evening. “You have got this. We have your backs, and you’ve got this. Bring her back to Earth.”

Close to midnight, the capsule reached one of the most important and treacherous legs of its test flight: reentry. The milestone required the Starliner to carefully orient itself as it plunged into the thickest part of Earth’s atmosphere while still traveling at orbital speeds — typically more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,400 kilometers per hour).

As with every spacecraft that returns from orbit, the pressure and friction of reentry put immense strain on the vehicle. The process could have heated up the spacecraft’s exterior to more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius).

Then, as the Starliner fell through the air, a set of parachutes — which Boeing redesigned and tested as recently as January — slowed the capsule before the vehicle deployed airbags for a gentle touchdown on terra firma.

Starliner is the first US-made capsule to parachute to a landing on the ground rather than splash down in the ocean. Boeing hopes that approach will make it easier to recover and refurbish the spacecraft after flight.

science,Ancient asteroid 20 times larger than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs likely hit Jupiter’s moon Ganymede,2024-09-05,Ashley Strickland,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Jupiter’s moon Ganymede may have shifted on its axis when a massive asteroid smashed into it about 4 billion years ago, according to a new study.

Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, is even bigger than Mercury and the dwarf planet Pluto. And past research has found evidence suggesting that beneath its thick, icy crust lies a salty ocean that is 10 times deeper than Earth’s oceans.

But many questions remain about the moon, and scientists need more high-resolution imagery of its surface to solve the mysteries surrounding Ganymede’s history and evolution.

Deep furrows cover large swaths of Ganymede’s surface, and they form a pattern of concentric circles around one spot that have led some astronomers to believe the moon experienced a major impact event in its past.

“The Jupiter moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto all have interesting individual characteristics, but the one that caught my attention was these furrows on Ganymede,” said Naoyuki Hirata, assistant professor of planetology at Kobe University in Japan, in a statement. “We know that this feature was created by an asteroid impact about 4 billion years ago, but we were unsure how big this impact was and what effect it had on the moon.”

Hirata is the author of a new study, published Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports, that explores what created Ganymede’s system of furrows and the fallout of the impact — which could be investigated more closely by the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft, which is currently en route to study Jupiter and its moons.

An ancient impact

Ganymede has long intrigued Hirata, who said he believes uncovering its evolution is “meaningful.” The moon’s surface is a study in contrasts, with bright regions of ridges alongside grooves that cut across darker areas.

Hirata took a closer look at the system of furrows on Ganymede, which extend from a single point on the moon’s surface like the concentric cracks that form when a stone hits a car windshield, he said.

Hirata noticed that the central point of the furrow was along the moon’s rotational axis, which implied that something like a large impact event caused a complete reorientation of the moon.

Previous research suggested that a large planetary body collided with Pluto early in its history, which rearranged the distribution of ice on the dwarf planet and led to the creation of a distinctive “heart” on the planet’s surface. Hirata said he believes a similar scenario occurred on Ganymede, with its icy shell and subsurface ocean.

A sudden change in the way mass is distributed on a planet can shift the location of its axis, or the imaginary line around which planetary bodies rotate. When a large asteroid slams into a planet, it creates a gravity anomaly that changes the way a planet rotates. So Hirata calculated what kind of impact could have created Ganymede’s current orientation.

His equations revealed that an asteroid about 186 miles (300 kilometers) wide initially created a crater around 870 to 994 miles (1,400 to 1,600 kilometers) in diameter.

The asteroid was 20 times larger than the one that collided with what’s now the Yucatán Peninsula in Chicxulub, Mexico, and led to the downfall of dinosaurs on Earth 66 million years ago. The crater left behind on Ganymede was 25% the size of the Jupiter moon, according to the study.

Juice mission’s up-close investigation

It’s still unclear how much Ganymede’s axis shifted, Hirata said. But future data collected by the Juice mission, or Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, could shed more light on Ganymede’s history and the impact event.

The spacecraft, launched in April 2023, completed a historic flyby of Earth and the moon on August 21 that has put it on track to reach Jupiter and its moons in 2031.

It’s difficult for researchers to know whether an ancient impact created the furrows on Ganymede without more data, which the Juice mission could provide, said Adeene Denton, postdoctoral researcher in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. She was not involved in Hirata’s study.

“This paper presents an interesting premise, with lots to think about for icy moon and ocean world evolution,” said Denton, who coauthored an April study covering the impacts on Pluto and its large basin, called Sputnik Planitia, which makes up the left lobe of the heart feature observed by astronomers.

“It’s worth noting that some skepticism can be warranted when considering ancient, degraded geologic features on planetary bodies and how they affect a planet’s orientation,” she said. “With so little information with these large, old features, it’s hard to be confident in the identification of this feature as a basin, as well as a potential mass anomaly. Luckily, unlike with Pluto and (Sputnik Planitia), we’re going back to Ganymede soon and can get the additional information needed to resolve this.”

Researchers believe that Ganymede’s interior may be like a club sandwich, stacked with alternating layers of ice and ocean. Understanding how the impact altered the moon could reveal insights into its intriguing internal structure, Hirata said.

“I want to understand the origin and evolution of Ganymede and other Jupiter moons,” he said. “The giant impact must have had a significant impact on the early evolution of Ganymede, but the thermal and structural effects of the impact on the interior of Ganymede have not yet been investigated at all. I believe that further research applying the internal evolution of ice moons could be carried out next.”"

London CNN —

A “remarkable” Pictish ring with “an intricate setting” was discovered in Scotland by an amateur archaeologist after being buried for more than 1,000 years.

The “kite-shaped ring with a garnet or red glass center” was unearthed by a volunteer at the site of a fort in Burghead, in northeast Scotland, according to the University of Aberdeen, which led the dig.

John Ralph, a former engineer and graduate of the University of Aberdeen, discovered the ring at the site of a fort in Burghead, northeast Scotland University of Aberdeen

John Ralph, a former engineer and graduate of the university, signed up as a volunteer for the Burghead digs after retiring.

Ralph, whom the university said describes himself as an “enthusiastic amateur,” had many moments over the two-week excavation when experts told him “he had a knack for finding ‘shiny pebbles.’” It was his third dig at the site.

“So when, on the last day of the final dig, he found something that looked interesting, he didn’t hold out much hope. It was only when he showed it to a fellow volunteer and his eyes lit up that he realized he might ‘have something,’” the university said in a statement Wednesday.

The Professor of Archaeology who led the excavation, Gordon Noble, said what Ralph presented to him was “truly remarkable.”

“John was digging and then came over and said ‘look what I’ve found,’” Noble said, according to the statement. “Even before the conservation work we could see it was something really exciting as despite more than a thousand years in the ground we could see glints of the possible garnet setting.”

The Picts were an ancient people who lived in what is now eastern and northeastern Scotland. Little is known about them, and “only limited and contentious documentary sources survive to evidence their six centuries of life,” according to the University of Aberdeen’s website. All traces of the Picts disappeared from the written records in the 9th century CE, it said.

Noble explained that there are “very few Pictish rings which have ever been discovered and those we do know about usually come from hoards which were placed in the ground deliberately for safekeeping in some way.”

“We certainly weren’t expecting to find something like this lying around the floor of what was once a house but that had appeared of low significance so, in typical fashion, we had left work on it until the final day of the dig,” Noble said.

The ring is undergoing analysis at the National Museum of Scotland’s Post-excavation Service, the university said.

Ralph, who grew up in Burghead, said he was thrilled to have helped understand the region’s Pictish past. “It is a real thrill to dig up an artefact in the knowledge that you are probably the first person to see it for 1,000-1,500 years,” he said. “It becomes a real guessing game of who owned it, what did they use it for and how was it lost.”

Susan O’Connor, Head of Grants at Historic Environment Scotland, said Ralph “played such a pivotal role in bringing it to light - literally!”

While the materials used to make the rink “are not particularly valuable in today’s monetary sense, this find is hugely significant for what it tells us about Pictish lives and society,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to find out more once our colleagues in the National Museum have finished their investigations.”"

science,Titanic: New photos show major decay to legendary wreck,2024-09-02,Amarachi Orie,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more

CNN —

In the years since the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912, we have become familiar with haunting images of the doomed passenger liner’s bow, lying at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Now, new photos taken this summer show that the view has changed dramatically.

The latest expedition by RMS Titanic Inc., an American company with salvage rights to the wreck, has revealed that a section of the previously intact railing around the front of the ship’s upper deck has fallen off. The 15-foot-long section now lies on the sea floor, directly below where it once was.

“We are saddened by this loss and the inevitable decay of the Ship and the debris,” the company said in a statement on its website.

“Over the course of the next few weeks and months, we will conduct a more thorough review of Titanic’s condition and her changes over time,” it continued.

“Although Titanic’s collapse is inevitable, this evidence strengthens our mission to preserve and document what we can before it is too late,” it added.

The July expedition, the company’s ninth since it first visited the wreck 1987, involved ocean imaging experts, oceanographers, scientists and historians working together to capture new images of the wreck to review its condition, identify artefacts and areas at risk, and contribute to ongoing conservation efforts, according to the company.

More than two million photos were taken, and the team searched for numerous artefacts.

This search yielded an exciting discovery.

On the final day of the expedition, the team found and photographed a two-foot-tall bronze statue of Diana, the Roman goddess of nature and hunting.

The statue, which once sat atop the fireplace mantle as a centrepiece in the Titanic’s First Class lounge, was ripped away and thrown into the wreck’s debris field when the lounge tore open as the ship sank, according to the company.

While the figure was photographed in a 1986 expedition, its location remained unknown until this latest expedition due to a tradition of secrecy surrounding the Titanic’s wreck, the company said.

Much of the art that decorated the halls and rooms of the ship “was made of organic materials, breaking down into the earth after many decades submerged in the hostile environment” of the ocean, the company said Sunday in an Instagram post on the statue.

CNN —

An ancient, submerged bridge in a cave on the Spanish island of Mallorca is helping researchers determine when humans first settled on islands across the western Mediterranean Sea thousands of years ago.

A new analysis of the 25-foot-long (7.6-meter-long) bridge inside Genovesa Cave has revealed that humans lived on Mallorca, one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, much earlier than previously believed. The findings could narrow the gap between when humans settled in the eastern and western Mediterranean regions.

A study detailing the findings published Friday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

A lack of written records and limited archaeological evidence have made it difficult to piece together the point at which humans colonized and settled on the Mediterranean islands.

But a telltale “bathtub ring,” along with mineral formations detected on the bridge, has allowed scientists to estimate that the structure was built nearly 6,000 years ago, said lead study author Bogdan Onac, a professor in the School of Geosciences at the University of South Florida.

“The presence of this submerged bridge and other artifacts indicates a sophisticated level of activity, implying that early settlers recognized the cave’s water resources and strategically built infrastructure to navigate it,” Onac said.

A mysterious cave

The bridge is made of large, heavy limestone blocks, some of which span 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across, and it remains unclear what mechanisms enabled ancient humans to build the bridge.

Researchers believe that those who built the bridge wanted a dry, continuous path to connect the cave’s entrance with a chamber beyond a lake within the cave.

The cave’s bridge was first discovered in 2000. A few years afterward, a study written in the Catalan language estimated the bridge to be 3,500 years old based on pottery found in one of the cave’s chambers.

Since then, research that radiocarbon-dated bones and pottery on Mallorca suggested a human presence may have been on the island 9,000 years ago, but poor preservation of the materials led researchers to question that timeline.

More recent research studying ash, bones and charcoal on the island suggests humans settled there about 4,440 years ago.

But having studied the rise of sea levels across other islands and the geologic footprints that sea level rise can leave behind, Onac and his colleagues took a different approach.

“It was only in the past four years that we finally gathered the data needed to address this longstanding research topic and better estimate the arrival time of humans in Mallorca,” Onac said.

Today, Genovesa Cave’s passages remain flooded as global sea levels rise.

Onac and his colleagues studied a light-colored band on the submerged bridge within the cave as well as calcite encrustations that formed on the bridge during times when the sea level was higher and filled the cave.

The encrustations are speleothems, or geologic formations that result from mineral deposits accumulating over time in caves.

By reconstructing historic local sea levels and analyzing the coloration band on the bridge as well as the mineral deposits, the team determined that the bridge was assembled about 6,000 years ago.

The color band matched the same level where mineral deposits formed when the sea level was at a standstill, indicating it must have been constructed earlier than 5,600 years ago, Onac said.

Retracing ancient steps

The bridge was likely used for 400 to 500 years before rising sea levels caused the cave’s lake to cover the bridge, Onac said.

The team doesn’t have clear evidence on how ancient humans used the cave, but it has some scenarios in mind.

Cave divers have found fossil remains from a now-extinct goat species that once lived on the island known as Myotragus balearicus. They also discovered pottery within a drive chamber connected to the cave entrance by the bridge, Onac said.

“This suggests that humans may have used the area near the cave entrance, a large collapse chamber, for living,” Onac said. “The purpose of crossing the lake to access that chamber remains unclear; it could have served as a refuge, place for rituals, or as a storage place, keeping food out of Mallorca’s hot days.”

There is evidence of small stone homes and structures made from large stones in Mallorca between 2,000 to 4,500 years ago. So it’s likely that the cave bridge is a precursor to the larger, more sophisticated stone works found on the island, Onac said.

Paleontologists are still trying to determine why Mallorca was settled later than the eastern Mediterranean Islands. Although it’s large and fairly close to Spain’s mainland, the island had a hot, dry climate with thin soil for farming. And apart from fish and native goats, Mallorca lacked a bevy of natural resources.

“In contrast, other islands had more favorable environmental conditions and abundant resources, such as minerals and livestock, which made them more attractive for early settlers,” Onac said."

CNN —

A rare fossil has provided a snapshot of what was an exceptionally unlucky day for a prehistoric sea cow.

The now-extinct species of dugong, a manatee-like marine mammal, was swimming in the sea about 15 million years ago when it was preyed upon by two animals: a crocodile and a tiger shark. The latter left one of its teeth impaled in the sea cow’s body.

By analyzing the fossil, unearthed in Venezuela, researchers were able to piece together how the sea cow, which belonged to an extinct group of animals known as Culebratherium, perished.

Their study, published Thursday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, captures a moment in time that provides unique insight into how the food chain worked in the early to middle Miocene Epoch 11.6 million to 23 million years ago.

“It’s super rare to find evidence of two predators on a single specimen,” said lead study author Aldo Benites-Palomino, a doctoral student in the department of paleontology at Switzerland’s University of Zurich. “It shows why we should be exploring for fossils in tropical regions like (Venezuela).”

Anatomy of an attack

The fossilized remains — a partial skull and 13 vertebrae or backbones — revealed three types of bite marks. Their shape, depth and orientation suggested that they were made by two predators: a small- to medium-size crocodilian and a tiger shark.

The crocodile-like creature attacked first, according to the study, with deep tooth impacts in the sea cow’s snout, suggesting it tried to grasp this part of the dugong’s face to suffocate it. Two other large, curved incisions indicate that the crocodile dragged the sea cow, tearing its flesh.

Striations and slashing on the fossil suggested the croc executed a “death roll,” a spinning behavior to subdue prey that is also observed in living crocodile species.

“This type of mark is only produced by biting events in which subsequent tearing, rolling or grasping actions are executed,” the study authors noted.

Then, the sea cow was picked apart by a tiger shark, which has narrow, non-serrated teeth. Differentiating between marks of active predation and scavenging can be challenging, but according to the study, bite marks throughout the sea cow’s body and the irregular distribution along with the variation in depth suggested to researchers that it was the behavior of a scavenger such as a tiger shark.

The scientists confirmed the shark’s identity through the discovery of an isolated tooth lodged in the sea cow’s neck that belonged to an extinct species of tiger shark, Galeocerdo aduncus.

“I had to work like a forensic scientist,” Benites-Palomino recalled.

However, the study noted that given the fragmentary nature of the skeleton — it wasn’t possible to rule out other scenarios for the sea cow’s demise.

Dean Lomax, a paleontologist at the UK’s University of Bristol and University of Manchester who wasn’t involved with the research, said he agreed with the study’s findings but said it is difficult to distinguish between scavenging and active predatory behavior.

“For instance, it is perhaps not unreasonable to think that the dugong was already dead, perhaps had floated and (was) bloated, and then was dined upon (scavenged) by the crocodylian and shark(s) at different times,” said Lomax, the author of “Locked in Time: Animal Behavior Unearthed in 50 Amazing Fossils,” via email.

“Unless we have the direct evidence of the dugong inside the croc (as a last meal), or the croc and dugong dying mid-attack, it is always inherently rare to say 100% whether this was definitively the result of an active attack over scavenging,” Lomax added.

Chance fossil discovery

Sea cows at that point in time could be as large as 5 meters (about 16 feet) long, Benites-Palomino said, and their fatty tissue would have been a good food source.

Today, crocodiles, orcas and sharks prey on dugongs and manatees, mostly targeting the young since adults are difficult to kill because of their size. It’s not clear exactly what type of crocodilian would have preyed upon the sea cow — it could have been an extinct type of caiman or gharial, known for a long, thin snot, but it would have been large — 4 to 6 meters (about 13 to 20 feet) in length.

“There are several candidates. South America was a paradise for crocodilians back then,” Benites-Palomino added.

A farmer south of the city of Coro, Venezuela, first noticed the sea cow remains in a location where fossils hadn’t been discovered previously.

“Initially, we were unfamiliar with the site’s geology, and the first fossils we unearthed were parts of skulls. It took us some time to determine what they were — sea cow skulls, which are quite peculiar in appearance,” said Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra, a study coauthor and a professor of paleobiology and the director of the Palaeontological Institute & Museum at the University of Zurich, in a statement.

Benites-Palomino said that the rare discovery showed the value of fossil hunting in “nonclassical” South America.

“We have been going to the same fossil sites in North America and China for a long time, but every time we work in these new areas we constantly find new fossils.”"

CNN —

When scientists attached a tag to a pregnant porbeagle shark in October 2020 to learn more about the creature’s habitat, they didn’t expect their tracker to capture evidence of how large sharks hunt one another.

But when the tracker registered some unexpected activity in March 2021, the scientists realized a larger shark had eaten their research subject.

The team shared these unexpected findings in a new study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.

“This is the first documented predation event of a porbeagle shark anywhere in the world,” said lead study author Dr. Brooke Anderson, a marine fisheries biologist in the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, via email.

Porbeagle sharks, which are found across the Atlantic and South Pacific oceans and Mediterranean Sea, can reach a little more than 12 feet (3.7 meters) long and weigh as much as 507 pounds (230 kilograms). The elusive, large sharks can also live between 30 and 65 years old. But female porbeagles can’t reproduce until they reach 13 years old. The females give birth to four pups every one or two years.

Habitat loss, overfishingand their fate as bycatch in fishing nets have threatened porbeagle shark populations. Northwest Atlantic porbeagle sharks are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

“In one event, the population not only lost a reproductive female that could contribute to population growth, but it also lost all her developing babies,” Anderson said. “If predation is more widespread than previously thought, there could be major impacts for the porbeagle shark population that is already suffering due to historic overfishing.”

Now, the researchers said they may have identified two suspects — a great white shark and shortfin mako shark—in this scientific murder mystery, changing the way researchers think about how large sharks interact.

Keeping tabs on sharks

When Anderson and her colleagues were tagging porbeagle sharks off Cape Cod in Massachusetts in 2020 and 2022, their intention was to track where pregnant porbeagles go to identify areas where the sharks and their newborn pups require conservation and protection efforts.

She and her team have been studying porbeagles for more than a decade, and they have become experts at tagging the sharks for study.

The researchers used rods and reels to catch the sharks and bring them aboard their boat. Saltwater pumps were placed in the sharks’ mouths to allow them to breathe.

“They actually calm down really well to make tagging easy,” Anderson said. “We’ve tagged dozens of porbeagle sharks in the past 10 years and are currently working on analyzing the data to determine the most important habitats for the population that can be prioritized for conservation and management directions.”

Each shark was outfitted with two satellite tags, a satellite transmitter mounted on the fin, and a pop-off satellite archival tag. The fin-mount tags transmit a shark’s current location to satellites when its fins are above the ocean’s surface. The pop-off tags measure depth and ocean temperatures and store the data until the tag pops off after a certain amount of time, floats to the surface and transmits its data to satellites.

The fact that the pregnant porbeagle was prey for a bigger shark became a bonus scientific discovery, Anderson said.

The team’s shark, measuring 7.2 feet (2.2 meters) long, largely remained underwater for five months, cruising along at depths of 328 to 656 feet (100 to 200 meters) at night and 1,969 to 2,625 feet (600 to 800 meters) during the day. The ocean temperature fluctuated between 43.5 and 74.3 degrees Fahrenheit (6.4 and 23.5 degrees Celsius).

But 158 days after the shark was tagged and released, the pop-off tag began to transmit data from the sea southwest of Bermuda, suggesting it had come off the shark and was floating on the ocean’s surface.

For four days in March 2021, the tag registered a constant temperature of 71.6 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius) at a depth ranging from 492 to 1,968 feet (150 to 600 meters). Then the tag floated up.

The team pieced together several factors that indicated the shark had been eaten and the tag excreted by a larger predator that gobbled up the shark, Anderson said.

“The first and most important data was the sudden spike in temperature recorded by the tag, even at 600 meters depth,” she said. “This indicated right away that the tag was now inside the stomach of a warm-bodied predator such as a lamnid shark. There was also a slight change in the diving pattern recorded by the tag, which also indicated the tag was now tracking another animal (the predator).”

The tag popped off eight months earlier than expected, and the porbeagle’s fin-mount tag never transmitted any data again.

“If the pregnant porbeagle shark was indeed still alive, we expect that she would have returned to the sea surface again and the fin-mount tag (would) transmit her location,” Anderson said.

Unusual suspects

Porbeagles belong to a family called lamnid sharks, which also includes great white sharks and mako sharks.

Unlike other sharks, most lamnid sharks are endothermic, meaning they can keep their bodies warmer than the water temperature.

“The porbeagle can do this better than almost all of its relatives and loves the colder waters of Canada and New England year-round,” Anderson said.

To determine what could have eaten the porbeagle shark as it swam near Bermuda, the team narrowed down the list of large predators swimming in the same vicinity big enough to hunt porbeagles — including its relatives, the great white shark, or Carcharodon carcharias, and the shortfin mako shark, known as Isurus oxyrinchus.

Shortfin makos have been known to hunt small sharks, porpoises, sea turtles, seabirds, bony fish and cephalopods. And great whites chow down on whales, dolphins, seals and rays.

Anderson’s team suspects the great white shark is the most likely culprit, given that shortfin makos make rapid dives between the ocean surface and its depths during the day, which the pop-off tag didn’t register.

“We often think of large sharks as being apex or top predators, but with technological advancements, we have started to discover that large predator interactions could be even more complex than previously thought,” Anderson said.

“It’s clear that we need to continue studying predator interactions, for example to estimate how often large sharks are hunting each other, and start to uncover what cascading impacts these interactions could have on the ecosystem.”

It’s not the first time one large shark has been eaten by another large one, but documentation of such events is rare.

Sharks hunting sharks in the open seas

Some of the biggest shark species aren’t shy about hunting their own kind, which is a fascinating part of the shark world that often goes unnoticed, said shark biologist Dr. Adrian Gutteridge, fisheries assessment manager for international nonprofit Marine Stewardship Council and member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Shark Specialist Group.

Gutteridge, who was not involved in the study, agrees that a white shark is the most likely culprit.

“This particular porbeagle, at 2.2 meters, might have seemed pretty formidable, but white sharks are around 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) the moment it’s born,” Gutteridge said. “By the time they reach their full size at 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16.4 feet), they’re fully capable of taking down other sharks. So, this porbeagle meeting its end from a much larger white shark isn’t so much surprising as it is a reminder of white sharks being at the top of the food chain.”

Satellite tagging is helping researchers track and discover shark nurseries, seasonal movement and behavioral patterns in sharks, which is especially crucial for protecting vulnerable populations, he said.

For decades, northwest Atlantic porbeagles were hunted for consumption. Fortunately, that population is stabilizing and increasing, but continued protection is vital to allow such recovery to continue, Anderson said.

Now, the team wants to uncover how often other sharks hunt porbeagle sharks.

“Uncovering the mysteries of the open ocean has always been challenging,” Anderson said. “It’s possible that the more large sharks we can tag and track, the more behaviors like this are going to be revealed.”"

science,"These monkeys use names to communicate with each other, study finds",2024-08-30,Lianne Kolirin,"Marmosets can communicate with one another by name and know when they are being addressed, joining a very short list of species exhibiting such behavior, and a first for non-human primates, a new study has found.

The monkeys use specific calls, known as “phee-calls,” to call each other, which scientists say is a “high cognitive” behavior pattern only previously observed in humans, dolphins and elephants.

The discovery, made by a team from the Hebrew University, is outlined in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.

“This is the first time that we have seen this in non-human primates,” David Omer, lead author and assistant professor at the university’s Safra Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC), told CNN Thursday.

The tree-dwelling primates are highly social animals and live in small groups in South America but researchers collected data at an animal facility at the university in Israel.

“The experiment was very simple,” Omer told CNN. “We just positioned two marmosets in the same room and positioned a visual barrier between them.

“When you do this they spontaneously start to engage in dialogue.”

Omer’s team recorded natural conversations between pairs of marmosets, as well as interactions with a computer system, which led them to conclude that the marmosets addressed specific individuals with the “phee calls.” Furthermore, the animals were able to discern when they were being called and responded more accurately in these instances.

Ten marmosets from three different family groups were recorded communicating during the process, highlighting “the complexity of social communication among marmosets,” Omer added in a press release.

He told CNN: “Until now, we thought that non-human primate vocalization is a genetically determined and non-flexible type of communication. But now we see that marmosets are capable of extremely flexible production of vocabulary.”

According to the study, marmosets are heavily reliant on vision but also display a “complex array of social calls” - of which the “phee call” is one. The calls are generally used to communicate when they are out of sight from each other.

As well as using different calls for different individuals, the marmosets were also found to be able to distinguish between calls directed at them and non-directed calls.

They were previously interpreted as a method of “self-localization,” according to Omer - in other words, a way to communicate their position with others. But the new study showed that the sounds were used as “specific calls to label and address specific individuals.”

The investigation also revealed that marmosets from the same family group used “similar vocal labels to address different individuals” and also employed “similar sound features to code different names,” the release adds. This practice, according to the study, resembles the use of names and dialects in humans.

Interestingly, the learning pattern could also be seen with adult marmosets who were not blood relatives, suggesting that they learn vocal labels and dialects from other members of the same group.

Omer told CNN: “We can say for sure that there was a learning process occurring here - so that they learn the names for the family members - and that it’s not genetic.”

Omer and his colleagues believe that their research provides new insights into how human language and social communication might have evolved.

He told CNN: “Until now we thought that human language was a big bang phenomenon that happened out of nowhere and only in humans - which is a complete contradiction to evolutionary theory.

“This finding, together with other findings, for the first time suggests that there were precursors for language development in non-human primates and we can find evidence for an evolutionary process.”

Earlier this year, another study found that African elephants may address each other using individualized calls that resemble the personal names used by humans.

The lead author of that study, Mickey Pardo, an animal behaviorist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University in New York, told CNN that the marmoset paper was “a very thorough piece of experimental work,” which “challenges the longstanding but outdated idea that humans are the only primate capable of vocal learning.”

However, Pardo expressed reservations about the idea “that different marmosets use the same name for the same receiver.” He said that his team had reached a similar conclusion in their elephant study before conducting further research which undermined their findings.

He said: “The more species we can discover that have names or something similar, the more opportunity we will have to use the comparative method to learn about the selection pressures that may have driven the evolution of names in our own species.”

CNN —

Imagine four skyscrapers the height of Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, stacked on top of one another.

That’s almost the height of an underwater mountain newly discovered and mapped by oceanographers led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute in California.

Located in the Pacific Ocean 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) off the coast of Chile, the seamount is 1.9 miles (3,109 meters) tall and part of an underwater mountain range that is home to sponge gardens, ancient corals and rare marine species — including a type of squid that was filmed for the first time.

A team led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute explored the region using the R/V Falkor (too) research vessel during a 28-day expedition that wrapped up this month. The researchers mapped the mountain using a sonar system under the ship’s hull.

“Sound waves go down and they bounce back off the surface, and we measure the time it takes to come back and get measured. From that we get a really good idea (of the seabed topography),” said Jyotika Virmani, the institute’s executive director.

“It’s important because at the moment only about 26% of the seafloor has been mapped to this kind of resolution. And the seafloor covers 71% of our planet’s surface.”

Oceanographers estimate that there are at least 100,000 seamounts higher than 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) around the world. They provide important habitats for a variety of species. The newly mapped underwater mountain is bigger than Mount Olympus in Greece, which is 2,917 meters (9,570 feet) high; smaller than Japan’s Mount Fuji, which stands 3,776 meters (12,388 feet) tall; and almost quadruple the 830-meter (2,723-foot) height of Burj Khalifa, the Dubai tower.

The researchers documented a ghostly white Casper octopus, marking the first time this deep-dwelling cephalopod has been seen in the southern Pacific. They also spotted two rare Bathyphysa siphonophores, sometimes known as flying spaghetti monsters for their stringlike appearance.

“The (Casper) octopus has never been captured, so it doesn’t actually have a scientific name yet,” Virmani said.

The team also recorded the first footage of a live Promachoteuthis squid, known only from a few collected specimens.

The discoveries were highlights of the research vessel’s third expedition this year to the Nazca Ridge, which is in international waters. The region could be a contender for the world’s first high seas marine protected area under a new UN treaty adopted in 2023 that is being ratified by states, Virmani said.

“Across the three expeditions, we managed to map and explore 25 seamounts, which is quite a number to explore,” she said. “I think we’ve got some good data as a community that could be put forward to make the case that this is a really interesting region for protection.”

The two previous expeditions in January and February cataloged 150 previously unknown species. An additional 20 potential news species were collected during the most recent expedition.

Details of the newly discovered species will be shared with the Ocean Census, an ambitious international collaboration to record marine life hidden in the world’s oceans. It aims to identify 100,000 unknown species in the next 10 years, allowing scientists to better understand and protect the deep-sea ecosystem.

science,‘ManhattAnt’: What to know about the invasive ant that’s ‘taken over’ NYC,2024-08-23,Taylor Nicioli,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Under the feet of millions of New Yorkers, a species of ant — originally not found anywhere else in North America — has been thriving in the concrete jungle for more than a decade, surprising scientists with its unique aptitude to flourish in Manhattan and the city’s other boroughs. But where the insect came from and why it has acclimated so well to this urban setting remained a mystery.

Now, scientists have discovered the ant’s identity and its origins, and it is a few thousand miles away from home. The globe-trotting insect is a native European species known as Lasius emarginatus, commonly observed in more natural settings in central Europe, according to new research.

Researchers first spotted the insect, dubbed the “ManhattAnt,” while doing a survey on ants in New York City in 2011. To their surprise, the ant — with its black head and abdomen and a red thorax — did not match any of the nearly 800 species found in North America and the researchers speculated that it might be a European species; no further research was done to confirm the species at the time.

But now, the insect has grown in numbers so that it is the second most common ant in the area, catching the attention of scientists and New Yorkers who live with the pest, said Clint Penick, an assistant professor of entomology and plant pathology at Auburn University in Alabama.

While entomologists keep a close eye on the non-native species to monitor its impact on the environment, they have a few theories to explain how the ant made it to North America and why it is so successful in the big city, according to a study published May 28 in the journal Biological Invasions.

The start of an invasion

A 2009 ant survey did not catch sighting of the ManhattAnt, which suggests it had arrived in the city soon afterward. Though it has called the Big Apple its North American home for only a little over 10 years, the species has been busy, spreading at a rate of about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) a year.

So far, the insect has also been observed on Long Island and in several New Jersey cities, according to the study. Based on the European climates that the insect can thrive in, the authors suspect the ant may be able to head as far north as Maine and as far south as Georgia in the future.

“The species has more or less taken over Manhattan in a decade,” said Penick, senior author of the study. “It is second most common to the pavement ant (Tetramorium immigrans), which has been (in New York) for at least a century.”

The invasive ants have so far been spreading naturally through mating flights — when winged ants fly away from the nest to form new colonies in the summertime — but the authors predict that the species will be able to extend farther through vehicle transportation, such as ships and cars, since it has become so dominant in a big city like New York, Penick said.

Such transport is likely how the ants arrived in North America in the first place, said Corrie Moreau, a professor of biology and entomology at Cornell University, who was not involved with the new study.

“A lot of non-native species or invasive species get inadvertently transported by humans, usually in things like either the soil of potted plants or sometimes in ship cargo,” but it is less common for such insects to take hold and persist in their new environment, said Moreau, who pointed to a 2005 study that found only 12% of previously introduced ant species ended up becoming established in their new settings.

Ants in the Big Apple

To identify the species of the ManhattAnt, the international team of researchers who worked on the May study first extracted DNA from the ants to compare with that of other species using a global database.

The genetic testing confirmed the ant was from the Lasius genus, but to identify which species exactly, the researchers sent specimens to coauthor Bernhard Seifert, a leading ant researcher in Germany who has studied the native European species. By comparing the New York ants with the European ones, Seifert was able to confirm the ant’s identity.

Because the non-native ants have become so common in New York City so quickly, the researchers first suspected that the ManhattAnt shared a trait commonly seen in other successful invasive ant species: a tendency to form what is known as supercolonies. Supercolonies are exceptionally large ant colonies made up of nests that have been known to span for hundreds of miles in some cases, Penick said.

“(Ants in supercolonies) have really low aggression, and they just kind of blanket the earth and are peaceful within their colony,” he said. Because the nests work together instead of against one another, they can spread faster and easily dominate an area by outcompeting native species, he added.

But when the authors tested that hypothesis on the ManhattAnts by collecting specimens from different nests throughout the city and placing them together, they found that the ants showed aggression and fought with one another, a sign that these insects maintain typical territories seen with regular colonies and not supercolonies.

With that theory ruled out, the researchers searched for other ways in which the ManhattAnts differed from other common ants in the area. They discovered that the ManhattAnts, one of the only species found regularly on New York sidewalks, have been uniquely tapping into a specific food source within trees planted along the city’s streets — a sticky liquid substance known as honeydew that is secreted by aphids and tree bugs such as the spotted lantern fly.

“Their ability to make that shift and utilize these urban structures and habitats (with food sources) that other ants can’t get to is a lot of what is helping them to be so successful in the city,” said Samantha Kennett, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the department of forestry and environmental conservation at Clemson University in South Carolina.

The ants have also been observed eating human food in some instances, whereas their European counterparts primarily feed on other insects and their droppings, Kennett said.

Usually, non-native insects that end up thriving are the ones that are generalists, Moreau said, meaning they’re not confined to a specific diet or to certain environments. “Because (the ManhattAnts) are more generalist, there’s a bigger chance that they can actually land in a new place and succeed,” she said.

Impact on the ecosystem

The ManhattAnts aren’t harmful to humans, but like any insect they can be a nuisance when they end up in apartments, Kennett said. The ants have been observed all the way up to the sixth floor of apartment buildings, according to the study.

However, the bigger concern lies in the potential negative impact the ants could have on their environments, such as the trees they are taking residence in, or the native species with which they could be competing, she added.

“One of the things we know about a lot of invasive ant species is they displace the native species, and the native species that they’re displacing usually have very specialized roles in the ecosystem, so you’re sort of disrupting that ecosystem when these species get introduced,” Moreau said.

“Maybe if (ManhattAnts) became the favorite food of birds, we would be less upset about it. But we haven’t seen any ways in which they’re beneficial yet, so we don’t know,” she added.

The authors of the May study said they hope further research will identify other traits the ants might have developed to become so successful in their new home as well as the extent of their current spread. Through an iNaturalist project, citizens can contribute observations of the insect by noting any sightings of the ants and taking photos to upload to the site.

Time will tell whether the ant has become more than just a nuisance and is disrupting the ecosystem, Penick said.

“Dealing with some ants in your kitchen isn’t the worst thing in the world,” he said. “My guess is that might be the worst that we see. That’s really my hope.”"

CNN —

Matching sets of footprints discovered in Africa and South America reveal that dinosaurs once traveled along a type of highway 120 million years ago before the two continents split apart, according to new research.

Paleontologists have found more than 260 dinosaur footprints from the Early Cretaceous Period in Brazil and Cameroon, now more than 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) apart on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

The footprints are similar in age, shape and geologic context, said Louis L. Jacobs, a paleontologist at the Southern Methodist University in Texas and lead author of a study describing the tracks published Monday by the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science.

Most of the fossilized prints were created by three-toed theropod dinosaurs, while a few likely belonged to lumbering four-legged sauropods with long necks and tails or ornithischians, which had pelvic structures similar to birds, said study coauthor Diana P.

Vineyard, research associate at SMU.

The trackways tell a story of how the movements of massive landmasses created ideal conditions for dinosaurs before supercontinents broke apart into the seven continents we know today.

Lush basins for life

The footprints were preserved in mud and silt along ancient rivers and lakes that once existed on the supercontinent Gondwana, which broke away from the larger landmass of Pangea, Jacobs said.

“One of the youngest and narrowest geological connections between Africa and South America was the elbow of northeastern Brazil nestled against what is now the coast of Cameroon along the Gulf of Guinea,” Jacobs said. “The two continents were continuous along that narrow stretch, so that animals on either side of that connection could potentially move across it.”

Africa and South America began to pull apart from each other about 140 million years ago. The separation created rifts in Earth’s crust, and as the tectonic plates beneath South America and Africa drifted away, magma in Earth’s mantle created new oceanic crust. Over time, the South Atlantic Ocean filled the space between the two continents.

But before this gradual change took place, different types of basins formed as Earth’s surface pulled apart. Rivers fed into the basins, forming lakes, Jacobs said.

The study authors found evidence of what’s known as a half-graben basin in northeast Brazil’s Borborema region and a similar one in the Koum Basin in northern Cameroon.

“A half graben is an elongate basin formed by pulling apart of the Earth’s surface with a fault forming on one side such that the bottom of the valley tilts down toward the fault along which movement is occurring,” Jacobs said by email. “Hold your hand in front of you. Tilt your fingers down, representing movement along the fault. Rivers will flow down the valley and deposit sediments and sediments will be eroded from the high side of the valley.”

Within both basins, the researchers found dinosaur tracks, ancient river and lake sediments, and fossilized pollen.

“Plants fed the herbivores and supported a food chain,” he said. “Muddy sediments left by the rivers and lakes contain dinosaur footprints, including those of meat-eaters, documenting that these river valleys could provide specific avenues for life to travel across the continents 120 million years ago.”

While dinosaur fossils can yield unique insights about the types of animals that roamed the planet millions of years ago, their footprints provide other windows into the past.

“Dinosaur tracks are not rare, but unlike the bones usually found, footprints are the proof of dinosaur behavior, how they walked, ran or otherwise, who they walked with, what environment they walked through, what direction they were going, and where they were when they were doing it,” Jacobs said.

It’s difficult to tell the specific species of dinosaurs that traveled along the basins, but they represent a larger portrait of the ancient climate and how different types of animals thrived in the environment that the continental rifting created.

“If your dog and a coyote walk across the same mudflat, you might know that two dog critters walked there, that they are very similar, but you may not be able to know if they are different species. Ditto the dinosaur track situation,” Jacobs said. “All animals have home ranges. All animals expand their ranges. All animals exploit resources as necessary depending on availability, often related to seasonality. Herbivores follow nutritious plants; carnivores follow their herbivorous food.”

At the time, rainfall levels helped create a tropical rainforest-type environment with abundant vegetation. Animals came to the basins from both present-day Africa and South America, causing their populations to mix.

“Imagine a lush, open basin with vegetation for the herbivores and carnivores following,” said study coauthor Lawrence Flynn, assistant director for the American School of Prehistoric Research and lab safety coordinator within the department of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University. “If nobody is there on the ‘new’ turf, then animals will disperse into it, given no competition.”

Later, once the continents drifted apart, this disruption likely caused a break in genetic continuity, a key driver of evolution, Jacobs said.

The dinosaur tracks in Cameroon were first discovered in the late 1980s, and Jacobs reported on them at the First International Symposium on Dinosaur Tracks and Traces, convened by paleontologist Martin Lockley, in 1986.

Jacobs then became friends with study author Ismar de Souza Carvalho, now a professor within the department of geology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Jacobs was studying dinosaur movements from the African side, while Carvalho was studying them from the Brazilian side.

As research into the basins in Africa and South America has continued in the following decades, Jacobs and Carvalho and their colleagues reviewed existing and new fieldwork and research to analyze the matching aspects. The new study is being published in tribute to Lockley, who devoted his career to studying dinosaur footprints.

“We wanted to put new and evolving geological and paleontological evidence together to tell a story more specifically of where and why and when dispersals between the continents happened,” Jacobs said.

“One beauty of this Earth is that any of us can see that Africa and South America used to fit together like puzzle pieces. It is easy to conceive that in a connected world, animals, including dinosaurs, could and would be likely to move from place to place.”"

science,Menga Dolmen: Engineering behind Neolithic monument revealed,2024-08-23,Katie Hunt,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Each of the 32 colossal stones that make up the Menga Dolmen, a 5,600-year-old megalithic monument in southern Spain, is many times bigger than the largest megaliths at Stonehenge, the most famous Neolithic wonder.

Embedded in the ground on a hilltop that rises about 50 meters (165 feet) above the surrounding plain, the stones form a dolmen, or single-chamber tomb, about 25 meters (82 feet) long and 5 meters (16.4 feet) wide at the widest point. The largest single stone weighs around 150 metric tons, about the same as a blue whale and nearly five times heavier than Stonehenge’s largest component. Collectively, the megaliths weigh about 1,140 metric tons.

“I tell the students in my lectures … the weight is more than two Boeing 747 airplanes combined, the ones that fly across continents and so on, fully loaded with fuel and passengers,” said Leonardo García Sanjuán, a coauthor of a new study on the monument and a professor of prehistory at Spain’s University of Seville.

“It’s a huge, enormous amount of stone, and it’s always been a mystery and an intriguing scientific question how on Earth (it was built given) the technology they had in the Neolithic period.”

The results of a decade-long research project published Friday in the journal Science Advances attempt to answer this question, revealing the surprisingly sophisticated engineering skills needed to accomplish such a feat.

“I’d noticed that its stones were carefully placed without gaps but this paper reveals just how precisely that has to have been done, with an extraordinary eye on the dimensions and angles,” said Mike Parker-Pearson, a professor of British later prehistory at University College London, who described it as “one of the world’s greatest megalithic wonders.” Parker-Pearson wasn’t involved in the research.

How to build a megalith

The project, led by José Antonio Lozano Rodríguez, a geologist at the Canary Islands Oceanographic Center, pieced together how the stones were cut, transported and placed by looking at the topography and geology of the site, information from previous archaeological excavations, and ethnographic and historical accounts of building techniques.

The upright stones that make up the walls of the chamber were not perfectly vertical, tilting inward at a gentle angle to make the building narrower at the roof than at the floor and creating a trapezoid-shaped chamber.

The team calculated that each of the upright stones lean inward at a largely uniform angle of 84 to 85 degrees. The upright stones that form the walls also lean sideways against one another at a consistent angle. The architect and builders must have used tools such as plumb levels and framing squares to achieve such consistency and accuracy, the study said.

A total of 32 stones were moved to the site from a quarry less than a mile away before being erected. Miguel Ángel Blanco de la Rubia

“The precision of the angles is millimetric,” García Sanjuán said. “They made a Tetris out of this, like the computer game.”

He added, “The stones were placed and carved so that they would be slightly inclined and perfectly adjusted to each other. Each block has to fit exactly with the others, and each block supports the others. All the stones are locked into one another and embedded into the bedrock.”

A unique feature of the monument revealed by the study showed how the upright stones were initially embedded, likely with the use of a counterweight, into foundation sockets so deep that up to one-third of the stones would have been below ground when first erected.

Once the walls had been completed, the builders placed five huge capstones to form the roof. The builders subsequently removed the earth to the desired floor level, erecting stone pillars for extra support.

“Once the capstones were added, it was like a solid box, with the bedrock still inside, and then they carved away all that rock, all that bedrock, to make the chamber,” García Sanjuán said.

The resulting building was then covered with a mound of soil, which would have insulated the chamber from cold and wet weather, as well as acting as a “straitjacket” to add stability to the construction, he added.

García Sanjuán said it’s not exactly clear how the dolmen was used, most likely as a temple and tomb, though few archaeological remains have been found within the relic. The paper suggested that one reason it was constructed to withstand the ages was because the region is seismically active.

Parker-Pearson said its makers wanted to create a solid structure that lasted for eternity.

“Although the authors of the Menga paper suggest this might be something to resist earthquake damage, I think there’s a more significant reason why stone monuments such as Menga, Stonehenge and many others were built so solidly, which is the attempt at permanence,” he said.

“This linking of stone with the eternal is something which I think is a feature shared by all the prehistoric megalithic dolmens (and other tombs) of western Europe,” he added.

“In the majority of cases these are tombs and dolmens for the dead, housing in perpetuity the ancestors who were also considered eternal.”

How did they transport the rocks?

Research published in December 2023 by the same team identified the source of the stones used to build the monument: a quarry 850 meters (0.5 mile) away, some 50 meters (164 feet) higher than the location of Menga — favorable topography that would have allowed for the transport of the massive stones down a gentle slope.

This study suggested that the builders would likely have designed a trackway or road to minimize friction of the relatively soft rock against the ground by embedding closely spaced timber poles or planks into the ground and transporting the stones using huge wooden sledges controlled with large ropes.

The dolmen was also built on a similar descending path from the back of the chamber to the entrance, enabling the stones to move along the same axis during the construction process.

“These new insights into the engineering skills confirm, along with the size of the dolmen’s massive stones, that these people of Iberia’s early Copper Age were intent on constructing a super-solid monument,” Parker-Pearson said via email.

“With such big stones, they couldn’t have afforded to make mistakes when manoeuvring them into position — if even just one was a few centimetres out, that would have been hard to correct once an upright stone was set in its construction trench.”

The new study described the Menga Dolmen as a one-of-a-kind example of “creative genius” and “early science” in a Neolithic society, a time when agriculture recently was adopted as a way of life and tools were made largely of stone and other natural materials rather than metal, and no written language existed.

“You see that these people knew about physics, friction, angles. They knew about geology. They knew the properties of the rocks, they knew about geometry,“ García Sanjuán said.

“Put these things together (and) what do you have? We have to call it science. We’ve never talked about Neolithic science before only because we are too arrogant to think that these people could do science the way we do it.”

“If any engineer today tried to build Menga with the resources that existed 6,000 years ago, I don’t think they could do it.”"

CNN —

An investigation of human remains from the 17th century British settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, has unearthed a long-hidden scandal in the family of the colony’s first governor.

Thomas West became Jamestown’s leader in 1610; he was joined there by three of his brothers and several other male relatives. Recently, DNA analysis of two skeletons from unmarked graves in a Jamestown church revealed that both people were related to West. The DNA also showed that the men were linked by shared maternal lineage. That connection led researchers to documents proving that one of the men — Captain William West — was illegitimate, born to Thomas West’s spinster aunt, Elizabeth.

Though Captain West was raised as part of the high-status West family in England, details of his scandalous birth were deliberately stricken from the family’s genealogical records, and lingering whispers of the scandal may have been one of the factors that drove him to seek his fortune in the American colony, researchers reported August 13 in the journal Antiquity.

The findings demonstrate how genetic data in combination with other historical evidence “can help bring to light narratives that were forbidden or shameful in the past,” said Dr. Christine Lee, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Mississippi, in an email.

“This in turn gives us a better understanding of how individuals circumvented societal rules,” said Lee, who was not involved in the research.

Unmarked burials in colonial Jamestown

Researchers found four unmarked graves at Jamestown in 2014, in an Anglican church that the colonists used from about 1608 to 1616. Superior craftsmanship of two coffins suggested that the people they held were important members of the colony. One was even buried with a spangled military sash fringed in silver.

These burial details, along with age estimates for the two skeletons and historic documents, indicated that the remains in the better-made coffins were those of Captain West (the owner of the sash), who died in his early 20s, and Sir Ferdinando Wenman, who died at age 34. Jamestown records named both as the governor’s kin, but only Wenman’s status — as a first cousin to the governor — was described, according to the study. The relationship between Wenman and West was also unknown.

The remains of Captain William West and Sir Ferdinando Wenman were among those found in four aligned graves (left) in the chancel area of the church site, signifying the high status of the deceased, according to the study. Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation (Preservation Virginia)

The next step for the scientists was to sample and analyze ancient DNA, or aDNA, from the skeletons, which is when the investigation made a surprising turn, said study coauthor Kari Bruwelheide, a skeletal biology specialist in the department of anthropology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.

“The aDNA took us in a very unexpected direction, one we never would have gone without it,” Bruwelheide said in an email.

Matrilineal clues unravel a mystery

Degraded over four centuries, the ancient DNA was in poor shape, so the only conclusive results were in the mitochondrial haplogroup — a matrilineal part of the genome, said study coauthor Dr. Éadaoin Harney, a lecturer of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University.

While there wasn’t enough DNA to show immediate family ties, Wenman and Captain West both shared the haplogroup H10e. This commonality indicated that they were likely close relatives on the maternal side of their lineage, which surprised the study authors who analyzed the genetic data.

“They had assumed that since Captain William West’s last name was ‘West’ and that ‘West’ was the last name of Ferdinando Wenman’s mother, that their relationship would have been on the paternal lineage,” Harney said. “The ancient DNA gave the anthropologists a direction to start searching in.”

That finding guided researchers toward documents mentioning Captain West’s female relatives, which eventually led them to a previously overlooked court case from 1616, regarding the beneficiary of West’s will. He had left his belongings (including family jewelry) to Mary Blount, another aunt of the Jamestown governor. In the legal documents, the researchers found their proof: court records stated that Mary Blount had raised Captain West “on behalf of her unmarried, deceased sister, Elizabeth,” the authors reported.

“The coded language and absence of formal documentary recognition of Captain West as her son supports the illegitimate nature of his birth,” the researchers wrote.

Even though the ancient DNA was incomplete, “it did yield enough evidence to show an unexpected relationship — through their female lines,” Bruwelheide said. “That led to a real in-depth investigation into other members of the family, which led to the court case and revelation of the illegitimacy.”

Their findings confirmed that Captain West, Governor Thomas West and Ferdinando Wenman were all cousins.

Illuminating this family secret adds another layer to the story of Jamestown, the oldest English settlement in North America, said study coauthor Michael Lavin, director of collections and conservation at the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation.

“The people who came here to forge a new life for themselves had family secrets and interpersonal drama just like we do,” Lavin said in an email. “The fact that we can reveal those secrets more than 400 years later is an incredible feat of the historical and scientific community.”

Amateur fossil hunter Eddie Templeton usually knows when he’s onto something. Having scoured creek banks in Mississippi since he was a kid, Templeton has made several stunning extinct mammal finds, including a mastodon mandible, numerous bones from a giant armadillo-relative, and even a saber-toothed cat’s foot bone. But his latest discovery may be the most unexpected.

Templeton was wading through around 3 feet (almost 1 meter) of water in a creek in Madison County on August 3 when he stumbled across a giant tusk partially exposed from the mud bank. The conditions weren’t great for fossil hunting, he said — the water had been blocked from draining downstream and there were no exposed gravel bars — so he hadn’t anticipated making a find of any particular importance that day. Coming across the 7-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) tusk, which turned out to be completely intact, and sharing it with George Phillips, the curator of paleontology at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, proved him wrong.

Phillips confirmed the tusk belonged to a Columbian mammoth, a distant relative of the woolly mammoth. Columbian mammoths lived during the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, making the fossil anywhere from about 11,700 to 75,000 years old, Phillips said.

“It was exciting to find a big piece of a tusk, certainly. But it was particularly exciting that it was a mammoth,” Templeton told CNN. “After the geologists got there, and we started uncovering it and realized that it was the entire tusk, from tip to base, it was even more exciting. So things just got better as the day went on.”

Prior to Templeton’s discovery, only isolated teeth of the Columbian mammoth had been unearthed in Mississippi, making it a first-of-its-kind find for the region and offering a “rare window” into the giant ice age mammals that once roamed the area, according to a statement from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.

Discovering Mississippi mammoths

While the massive Columbian mammoth — which weighed over 22,000 pounds (10 tons) and could grow to be over 13 feet (4 meters) tall — lived across North America alongside the mastodon, its diet largely consisted of grasses found in grassland biomes, which were rare on what’s now the East Coast of the United States during that period, Phillips said. As a result, its fossils are much harder to come by in the area.

“For every, say, 25 fragments or whole teeth of American mastodon, we find maybe one mammoth tooth at best. So, mammoths are proportionally rare, not just with respect to mastodons, but to everything else,” Phillips said.

When Templeton first came across the giant tusk, he assumed it was from a mastodon, having found several remnants of the creature on his prior hunts. It was after the local museum and state office of geology helped him unearth the massive remains that Templeton began to have second thoughts — mostly due to the fossil’s telltale curve.

The Columbian mammoth’s tusks are so curved that two could almost make a complete circle, whereas common mastodons’ tusks do not curve nearly as much, Phillips said. The museum has numerous tooth fragments and even several complete teeth from the mammoth — there may even be some fragments of tusks from the giant mammal that cannot be distinguished from the mastodon without having the rest of the tusk — but a complete, intact tusk like the one discovered is especially rare, he added.

“I was kind of open mouthed when I saw the picture,” Phillips said. “I thought, ‘OK, well, cool, a tusk. Wait a second … it’s so curved. Holy cow, this is a mammoth tusk.’”

While unearthing the fossil, the field scientists simultaneously covered the exposed bits with plaster to keep the fossil protected during extraction. The tusks grew in rings, similar to how trees grow, Templeton said, which causes the fossils to be more likely to fragment once they dry up after being taken from the moist deposits where they are found.

The tusk — which weighed 600 pounds (272 kilograms) with the plaster jacket — is currently at the museum, where experts will closely monitor it while it dries out and then treat it with a cohesive for preservation. Scientists will also need to reassemble the fragile fossil, which broke into two pieces during transportation. Phillips said he hopes to have the tusk on display in time for the museum’s annual Fossil Road Show during the first week of March next year.

“I think most people are curious about the past, and these megafauna that existed during the ice age fascinate people,” Templeton said. “I’m sure there have been pieces of mammoth tusk found in Mississippi, but probably not positively identified as mammoths just because they’re fragments. But this is the first complete mammoth tusk found in Mississippi. And so that’s pretty cool.”"
