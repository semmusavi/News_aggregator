Google’s search business was declared to be a monopoly. Now its ad business is on trial,Brian Fung,09/09/2024,"Specifically, the high-stakes legal battle focuses on the $31 billion portion of Google’s ad business that matches website publishers with advertisers and determines what banner ads appear on countless sites across the web.
Authorities have called for Google’s alleged ad-tech monopoly – which is distinct from Google’s search or search ads business – to be broken up.
Google competes against hundreds of companies that offer their own ad exchanges or ad tech tools, including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok to name a few, according to its filings.

Still, a breakup of Google’s ad tech business could potentially trigger a shakeup of the digital advertising industry and Google’s role within it.",entertainment

How plaid became popular for school uniforms,Jacqui Palumbo,09/05/2024,"CNN —As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid.
It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.
Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted.
But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014.

Women will soon be notified about their breast density after a mammogram. Here’s what that means,Jacqueline Howard,09/09/2024,"“The second reason that breast density is important is because having dense breast tissue raises a woman’s level of risk of developing breast cancer,” Feigin said.

Women will soon be notified about their breast density after a mammogram. Here’s what that means,Jacqueline Howard,09/09/2024,"“The second reason that breast density is important is because having dense breast tissue raises a woman’s level of risk of developing breast cancer,” Feigin said.
Breast cancer survivor JoAnn Pushkin, 64, has advocated for more than a decade that there be a national requirement for women to be notified of their breast density.
Now I have lymphedema, and all because it was detected at that later stage,” said Pushkin, who has testified before the FDA about breast density and co-created the website DenseBreast-info.org, which features resources on breast density.
The new FDA changes require facilities to provide patients with information about their breast density and include specific language in the mammogram result letter to explain how breast density can influence the accuracy of a mammogram.
A study published in 2022 found that the breast cancer death rate dropped by 43% within three decades, from 1989 to 2020, translating to 460,000 fewer breast cancer deaths during that time.",sports

How plaid became popular for school uniforms,Jacqui Palumbo,09/05/2024,"CNN —As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid.
It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.
Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted.
But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014.
(Dwyer-McNulty herself attended two different Catholic schools in Philadelphia, wearing plaid uniforms through high school).",science
